We found out mid Jane, and they said he had 6 mos to live. He's a 100% disabled vet, and all his care for last 25 years has been with the VA. I have mixed feelings about them over all, but the people in critical care have been very supportive. Things have escalated very quickly. Before his first chemo treatment they said he was too weak for it. He's now on high flow oxygen and we found out last week he won't be coming home. He's been confused, but has been able to talk and hold a conversation up until Saturday night. He is in a tremendous amount of pain, can't talk, and pain medication they have him on doesn't seem to be enough. Palliative care is double booked and they're trying to get him into there or hospice, but they're waiting for him to be in less pain because he won't have a sitter in hospice. That doesn't exactly make sense to me, because they said he'll be in less pain in palliative care! Just don't know what to believe or think.

"UPDATE: What is palliative care [hospice] at home like?My dad was home for 3 weeks, then passed away peacefully with my siblings, mom and I by his side. The medical team visited us nearly every weekday and we had numbers to contact if we needed additional help outside their visits (we only used that one time and a team was sent immediately to administer pain medication). We felt pretty well supported by the medical staff which was all thankfully covered by the national health care system.
 
 It was really hard some of the time, dealing with constant diaper changes, vomiting blood, delirium, and a ton of medications to keep track of. But it was also what my dad wanted and I think we fulfilled that pretty well.

 She's a conservative Christian woman (with a liberal heart) and for that reason resistant to the idea, though it's almost legal here in Canada. I am not a regular weed smoker myself, but am panicking a bit as I know this might help her. Also, she smokes cigarettes so smoke is not an issue.

"I can answer one of those questions: you can use either VA OR private insurance/medicare. The VA will only pay for care received at a VA facility unless you have prior approval, which is not easy to get unless you live far away from a VA hospital. 
 
 Personally, I have had some very bad experiences with the VA, so if you have any alternative, I would suggest going with that.
 
 Private insurance will almost always be your primary payer of his treatment, so you should get a list of hospice programs that are in his network. Those programs will determine what care he will get. Perhaps you can start there. If he's been to an oncologist, they will have palliative care specialists that can help you choose and answer a lot of your other questions.

"yes yes, definitely stay away from the googles. It will only make you more upset. 
 
 First, I disagree a little with the others. But I think it depends on your existing relationship. Are you close? Like besties? Is she more authoritative and distant? I think moving forward, if you're not there, having a close relationship requires honesty. I say, be open and honest with her with your feelings. Chances are if you're feeling scared or nervous or anxious or even mad -- she's feeling it too and you can both talk about how cancer makes you feel. You may even feel a little less alone by the end, each realizing you're not alone. Become good friends, talk to her like you would your bestie. Sometimes she might just want to sit and talk, maybe even about something other than cancer. Ask her to tell you some funny stories about when you were little. Tell her some memories that you remember (she might not even realize you remembered those things). I didn't get super close with my mom until I came home from college, when I realized that she is just a human being and doing absolutely the best she can. It was too easy for me in high school to lose our relationship in my own selfishness. You may not have the luxury of taking your sweet time to come to the realization that no one in this world loves you as much as your mother does. The sooner you realize that, the easier it will be to transform your relationship from mother/daughter into the best of friends. I think honesty is the best policy, if you have questions about her treatments or medicines, ask her. Ask her if she wants someone to come sit with her while she does her chemo or waits in the waiting room for another doc appointment. Sometimes just being there means the world.
 
 What kind of cancer is it and what stage is she? I don't want to give you all kind of palliative advice when what you really need is hope. It is a HUGE difference. Without knowing, my best advice is to live each and every day like it might be your last day together. Skip hanging out with your friends or going to the movies and just hang out with your mom. If she's mobile, take her on a mother daughter date. Tell her you just want to spend time with her. Even if it's just sitting on the couch watching tv together. In 20 years you won't even remember your friends names and while hanging out at the mall may seem important now, you'll look back and be so happy you have those memories with your mom instead.

 I'd stick around. Start treatment and see where it leads you. If you start suffering. If the pain starts to be too much and affects the quality of your life maybe then you could stop treatment and go for hospice or palliative care.

 Also if not: even only getting palliative treatment might not be an immediate death sentence. I have been diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in 2013. I still got curative treatment initially. It didn't work, so my treatment has been officially palliative and my cancer declared incurable since 2014. I'm still here.

"Initially diagnosed oct 2017 with invasive ductal carcinoma stage 2B intermediate grade. Her2+, ER/PR-. I was 36 yrs old. 
 
 Nov 2017- March 2018Did 3 cycles of FEC. 3 cycles of Docetaxol. Had a complete pathological response to chemo.
 
 April 2018 Unilateral left side modified radical mastectomy 
 
 Opted not to have radiation. 
 
 Feb 2018 Bone mets found on CT scan after I complained of a sore back and neck and had a sudden increase in blood calcium. Mets were located on vertebrae T2, T6, T11. Chemo caused these mets to calcify. 
 
 Started Herceptin and Zometa Feb 2018 and have been on them for the past 4 yrs.
 
 Generally I am doing well and have had zero progression in 4 yrs. I do have joint and muscle pain through out my body. We assume it is from the chemo and targeted treatments. I deal with a ton of brain fog to the point I quit driving (backing into my MIL's brand new car one evening solidified that for me). I am tired a lot and extremely unreliable due to fatigue and the general feeling of being unwell and so I no longer work, which for some may sound great but it is really isolating. It seems the only time I leave my house is for medical appointments. But I get to be with my kids and raise them with their dad, my husband. I am grateful to have no progression and to be able to mostly care for myself. I have a great support system especially with my husband. 
 
 I was never given a timeline on life expectancy. In fact my original oncologist just out right refused to talk about it and would repeat ""Mindy you are fine and healthy. You will be here many years."" I fired him last year because I felt he wasn't listening to my concerns and was being extremely dismissive. If I got upset about anything at all he would state that I need therapy and then compare me to his other patients. I used to get printed copies of everything in my health records and in one of his consults to my family doctor he advised her that my estimated lifespan would be 5-7 yrs. I have now used up 4 of those years. Others in my situation consider this a chronic condition. I however can not see it like that, it is ultimately a terminal illness and unless something else kills me first cancer is my death sentence. I am ok with this, I made peace with this very quickly. There is power in acceptance. I say this because initially I was extremely emotional, fearful and angry. I wasted so much of my precious time crying and staying in bed feeling sorry for myself that I knew it wasn't sustainable and nor was it fair to myself or my family. It took months of hard work and self reflection and what I finally found helped me was to sit down and write out my advanced medical directives and make a plan for end of life care. I live in Canada and so we have access to medical assistance in dying and so I met with them and had all my questions answered. I also met with palliative care who really helped me feel at ease with my situation. They answered the questions my oncologist refused to answer and they reassured me that their role was quality of life vs my oncologist's stance of quantity of life. I feel that because I was able to let go of the anger and fear and make peace with my fate that I have been a happier more present mom and wife. Now that's not to say I don't have bad days. I do, frequently but I am much more capable of recognizing those days, giving the fear, anger and sadness the space it needs and then I get on with it. 
 
 I have a lot in my life to be grateful for. If I get to see my children off into adulthood I will be able to die knowing that I served my purpose and that they will all be fine.",positive,positive,positive,support,support
You can talk to a pain management doc or palliative/supportive care,positive,neutral,neutral,support,support
"Does your treatment center offer a support team? Where I work I usually involve them to help these conversations. We have social workers and a nurse practitioner to help these conversations. We also have an in-house palliative care team that is wonderful at having these conversations with people's family. 
 
 I'm sorry you are going through this on top of everything.",positive,positive,positive,support,support
"if you ever end up feeling too sick to function mentally in daily life I'd suggest asking your doctor for some pain medicine like dilaudid or fentanyl because those are excellent anti-depressants (there's a reason why opiate addicts are able to live in the gutter perfectly happy while high on their drugs). nderf.org.
 
 There's no point to living in pain if you don't want to because palliative care means you get access to all the most life-altering happy drugs where you could take them and have a great day every day. Just ask for them. They make you feel so much better, which is why they're so controlled, people get stuck on them specifically because they make you feel much better, but they aren't that mind-altering in the sense that say getting drunk or high on weed is.",positive,positive,positive,support,neutral
Is your father stage 4? It really depends on how aggressive the type of cancer he has is. Folfox is usually palliative so people stay on it until it stops working or into their body cannot tolerate it anymore. Breaks are often okay before surgery and after and also if your bloodwork isn‚Äôt great. Doctors will give a week or two break to allow your white blood cell counts etc to come back up naturally. It isn‚Äôt always a bad thing but delaying treatment in advanced disease is also not the best. Your doctors know best 80% of the time.,not relevant,neutral,neutral,unrelated,neutral
"What does your oncologist say. That is the person to talk to. They will be able to answer all of your questions and determine whether or not you should delay treatment. And as a cancer patient you should call the hospital and speak to a palliative care nurse who can give you information about your type of cancer and what it means related to pain and death.
 
 Also you say that you have cancer on your face and that you are worried about chemo. I don‚Äôt understand the kind of cancer and why chemo and not radiation or surgery or immunotherapy. If you‚Äôve been diagnosed with cancer they have given you a specific diagnosis. If it is on your face is it skin cancer?",positive,neutral,neutral,support,neutral
"No please don‚Äôt ever apologize. It‚Äôs just surreal .The prognosis is grim, it‚Äôs terminal, radiation will be palliative in nature. I finally found one doctor on his team that didn‚Äôt sugar coat and tell me about the power of prayer. We are lucky for 6 months and that‚Äôs with radiation ( full head). My husband doesn‚Äôt know , he‚Äôs thinking with treatment he has 5 years, it‚Äôs obvious different doctors on his team are looking to milk the insurance company for as much as they can and therefore putting my husband through unnecessary pain. There are masses on the lungs with the largest being wrapped around vital organs including the aorta. There are several brain tumors scattered around the cerebellum, the brain stem , the cerebrum and the largest on frontal lobe. Getting the biopsy was difficult reason being the first attempt failed because the masses necrotized. ( that if I‚Äôm using the correct terminology, but its dead calls ) whatever that means but I‚Äôd imagine not good.",neutral,negative,positive,neutral,neutral
"Is she having any form of care at the moment? Palliative/pain etc? It would be worthwhile asking if you could go along to some medical appointments with her and also to find out what help and supports are out there. As well as medical supports there are charities and other organisations out there you can look for help and information from depending on where you are. 
 
 She may be very overwhelmed and struggling or may be feeling like she knows what‚Äôs right for her but letting her know you want to help and will be there for her would be great (I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already done this). She may be trying to protect you too. 
 
 Just continue to be a good support to her and help as much as she will allow. Thinking of you both.",neutral,positive,positive,neutral,support
"See if there is palliative care in your area. Here, you can get it in home. Maybe you have that? Palliative is different from hospice in that they aren‚Äôt focused on end of life, but symptom and disease management. They have a bad connotation but they are extremely extremely helpful with stuff around ADLs and pain. I highly recommend this. 
 
 Also, caregiver support for you. You can‚Äôt take care of her if you‚Äôre not taking care of yourself. Hugs!

"My mother was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic about a year and a half ago. It too had spread to her liver. They told her she had a year with chemo, maybe six months without.
 
 So she started the palliative chemo and is doing remarkably well. She's already outlived the initial ""expiration date"" (her words, not mine) and feels ok between chemo sessions. 
 
 I know this is borrowed time. I'm not getting my hopes up that she can beat this; I don't think anyone can. I don't know how many xmases she has left, but I can probably count them on one hand.
 
 I wish I could comfort you, tell you it's all gonna be ok, but you and I both know that's bullshit. The entire situation sucks. I'm almost 40, but I'm not ready for a world without my mom in it.

"My husband and I self-referred to palliative care, because if we‚Äôd waited for his oncologist to suggest it, we could‚Äòve been waiting a long time. We both knew where we were/are heading, and our experience has been positive so far. My husband is continuing palliative chemotherapy for the time being, which they have been fine with, and their occupational therapist has been fantastic sourcing equipment to keep him comfortable and at home for as long as possible.",positive,positive,positive,support,support
