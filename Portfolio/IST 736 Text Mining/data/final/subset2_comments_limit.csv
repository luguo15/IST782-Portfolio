The thing is acting on this early makes all the difference and greatly improves your chances of this being over before you know it.

The alternative is to ignore it and hope for the best like I did.

&gt; become kind of obsessed with all the food I can't have.

Technically wrong, because fat has only calories, no nutrition. You are undernourished. Not under 'fatted.' See reports about dieting/dieters, who become obsessed with food. Not because they cut out one food group, because they under eat aka diet.

&gt; I think I'm now cancer-free

I think they want to follow you up for a couple of years w blood tests and a scans ...

With the undereating/not enough nourishment, I personally (and having read up on it) recommend a whole-food plant-based diet which is oil/fat-free. Which means mixed salads with your meal. Sources I can recommend is [McDougal](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&amp;text=John+McDougall&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=John+McDougall&amp;sort=relevancerank), [Greger](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Cookbook-Recipes/dp/1250127769/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530374435&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=how+not+to+die) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=whole-food+plant-based+oil+free&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch).

Overall, you are in the worst position one can be post-RPLND (except death or other adverse outcomes), so, if you have the resources, you could ask for a 2nd opinion (should look up a centre of excellence or what they are called) about the strategy going forward. Especially because with each intervention to manage the collateral damage from the RPLN, your overall morbidity risk rises (eg infection, another 1-5% adverse outcome). And consult Google ""RPLND lymph fluid post operative management"".

Fingers crossed.

PS/edit: I had a look through the EU Uro Guidelines.

1. [It is recommended that the RPLN is done at centers of excellence](http://uroweb.org/guideline/testicular-cancer/#7)

&gt; When RPLND is indicated, this should be performed in referral centres, as residuals from seminoma may be difficult to remove due to intense fibrosis [202]. Ejaculation may be preserved in these cases [204].

2. No mention how to manage lymph leakage.

3. [Fatigue post-chemo varies and can last up to 6 months or longer.](http://uroweb.org/guideline/testicular-cancer/#8) Ask you onco to test your C-reactive protein levels and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist's levels (markers for inflammation). Which a whole-food plant-based oil/fat-free diet does counter. See [nutritionfacts.org on Inflammation.](https://nutritionfacts.org/?s=inflammation) eg [Boosting Immunity while Reducing Inflammation](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/boosting-immunity-while-reducing-inflammation/) Which answers your concerns regarding immunity:

&gt; I'm concerned about my immunity becoming lowered.

PS/edit: #2

Back-up for a whole-food plant-based oil/fat-free diet?

&gt; [optimizing nutritional requirements along with palliative measures.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Chylous-ascites-following-radical-nephrectomy%3A-a-Shah-Ahmed/7674c720af49e41862ec1d8918f9383995d5d6b8)

So this is a marathon and strict change of diet thing. ""palliative"" means that there is no cure.

PS/edit: #3

&gt; I'm on a basically 0 fat diet

Could you ask your onco if 0 means 0? Because even oats and rice and beans do have fat even greens ... or if the clinical recommendation is no free oil's and no high fat foods (eg olive oil, and fat content from flesh and processed foods like yoghurts). And where whole nuts and an avocado fit in.",t3_8uzlbm,,2018-06-30 16:11:28,/r/testicularcancer/comments/8uzlbm/rplnd_hell_chylous_ascites_and_not_nervesparing/e1k38vc/,,,

One. The problem after the 2nd round of chemo (even if different, type or combination) is chemoresistance.

Two. Why did you not receive radiotherapy and surgery? Did the biopsy reveal that radiotherapy (that it was more than just seminoma) would do nothing to it? 

If so, why did they not opt at any time to relieve you of the tumour mass? Was it technically not possible/Surgeons though it was too difficult/impossible? 

Going forward, get a good 2nd opinion via your healthcare systems specialist hospital. As going forward, every intervention is called ""desperation"" and ""salvage"".

If your current oncology does not want to ask for a 2nd opinion from your countries 'centre of excellence' (even if only for palliative care) through the healthcare system, you should. Doctors have email addresses and telephone numbers staffed with secretaries.

Being frustrated will proceed with many people thinking that you are just trying to game the system.

Options that you can discuss with your Urologist are:
- Toradol (they may not want to give if your kidneys took a hit from surgery or you have baseline kidney dysfunction after surgery)
- IV  Acetaminophen (available with varying degree, limited by liver dysfunction)

Narcotic options are 
-returning to a PCA
-discussing a Palliative care contact to start medications like methadone

So today, his oncologist comes in, with a pharmacist to talk about the clinical trial he was recommending. 


My guys images, were not good, there is a lot of new Disease in several parts of his body. Growing very fast.


I told him I was afraid the trial would not stop the growth in time and told him the chemos that Einhorn said.


He told us we can talk about that and that the chemo is a better option to stop growth fast where the immunotherapy is not. He straight said that the clinical trial is his and it’s good for his career to get people into it. So he’s biased.

I asked can he do the immunotherapy if/when progression after this chemo. He said yes, if the trial is still open.

We decided to go with the palliative chemo regiment. We decided this because his cancer is growing incredibly fast, innumerable lung nodules, multiple liver lesions, large one sitting against his lumbar spine and a new brain met. Bhcg 15,000 the week before MSK then BHCG 36,000 that week later. 


So doing the palliative chemo with the idea of trying to put out the fire, then when he starts to progress again get him into a clinical trial. The trail this oncologist is running is an immunotherapy. 22 men have been in it so far, one person is a year out without progression, 2 others bought some time and 19 others progressed right through.


The chemo regiment he’s on GemOx, is once a week for 2 weeks, week off for transfusions/ recovery, x 3 then reassess. We are doing this at our home hospital.
In the meantime he’s been put on continuous oxygen because the condition of his lungs. Today was supposed to be his second weeks chemo for the first round. But, he is wiped, his bloodwork is too low and they are going to admit him until his platelets and hemoglobin stabilize at a good place and then they can do the chemo again.


He’s afraid he’s never going to leave the hospital. I won’t say it to him, but I am too. We just got out marriage license yesterday, we had plans to get married next week, just us and our parents. 


Because of freaking Covid, the hospital only allows one individual visitor a day and only from 4pm-8pm. He has a very close friend flying in tonight that was going to spend the weekend with us.

I have been lurking but haven't posted much.  Diagnosed Feb 2021, had orchiectomy on right. Seminoma cancer spread into the lymph nodes in the abdomen.  Went through the first chemo regimen and stopped the growth and shrunk the tumors, three months later (October) I had another PET scan and it showed spread into my chest - sitting next to my heart and lungs.  
Went through high dose chemotherapy and auto-stem cell transplants - in my PET scan yesterday it looks like none of the tumors shrunk.  The wording is ""Impression:   1.  Mediastinal, supraclavicular, hilar, portacaval and aortocaval  lymphadenopathy with increased activity concerning for metastatic  involvement, although appearing similar in size and extent when compared  to imaging from December 16, 2021.""  The CT scans and PET scans have not indicated any problems with my brain.  


My question is this - what's the next step?  My first chemo regimen was cisplatin/etoposide, the last regimens I went through was hi-dose TICE with the stem cells and it appears it did not work at all. I haven't had radiation yet, so I'm assuming that will be at least part of it.

It has been a brutal 15 months already and I'm really starting to worry. I go in for another oncology appointment this Weds to go over the results with my doctor.  Just wondering if anyone has been through this to this extent that can give me some spoilers or advice.

My takeaway for TC diagnostics - ultrasounds are only so accurate. Soundwaves can only tell your doctors so much. Tumor markers are the best pre-surgical diagnostic tool for TC, but removal and biopsy are the most effective diagnostic method.

Patsiecki,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_fnffk,2,c1hbr4m,"I'm coming up on my one year anniversary of being diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer. It's a very, very long story. Heck, at one point I was given days to live! I'll spare you the great wall of text. (EDIT: An even *bigger* wall of text.)

Anyway, I've been fighting like crazy, but let me tell you, I didn't leave the gate at a gallop. It's unrealistic to think one would not be devastated at the news. I was. When I was diagnosed, I was given a couple years guaranteed, more depending on how well I respond to/tolerated treatment. When I asked my doctors what could be done, they said all they could offer was palliative care.

I refused to accept it, and I wasn't the only one. I had a degree of hesitation even then, but certain friends and members of my family fought even harder than me at first. Long story short, after a few second opinions and sending out key medical records I had obtained and saved, I found a doctor willing to perform surgery. Best-case? *Cure*. I'm not so delusional to expect this 100% to be the outcome, but *what a far cry it is from what my doctors told me originally, and what a far cry it is from what MY doctors originally even thought was possible!*. My surgery is in less than a week. Even then, I'll still go through months of chemo even if the surgery is successful to hopefully deal that finishing blow. (Wish me luck!)

Don't feel like your case is hopeless. For a fellow stage IV sufferer like myself, it seemed that way at first, but look where I am now because *I never stopped fighting*. I know what you're thinking - I didn't know whether I had the strength to put up such a fight either. But I thought about it. *What am I supposed to do here? Sulk and wallow in misery and let this bastard disease take me?* No. That's stupid and pointless, and you'll find that out too if you haven't already.

We have no choice but to fight. You see all those cancer patients at the hospital that are going to have chemo over and over again no matter how hard it is (and believe me, I know), and wonder how they do it? Because they have to. They all have their reasons - friends, family, themselves, their pet cats, god? I'm not about to let my friends and family see me give up and let the cancer win. If I don't make it through this, I'll be proud, and my family can be proud, that I fought until the bitter end.

Go through the motions. It's never easy, and it's hardest at first. I didn't really talk to other sufferers like myself. I was still on Digg at the time, so I didn't have /r/cancer to read through or talk to. So I'm writing and talking to people here and elsewhere to help them, especially through the beginning stages like you are. I hope that you'll be able to get through the tough parts and start your fight faster than I did.

Find your source of strength. Mine was my family, my friends, and my wife. They were my ultimate support group. Figure out what you want to do - live comfortably, fulfill some goals, fight the disease. Never let it win. Remember there are thousands upon thousands of people in the same position and a ton of us are willing to be there and help you deal with this. That said, I offer an open line of communication if you need to talk to someone who knows what you're dealing with.

Good luck, and fight on.",t3_fnffk,t1_c1hbr4m,2011-02-18 16:56:17,,,I don't know how to be brave.

newmodernist,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_gu6ig,2,c1rh35e,"I'm not even sure where to begin.  My mother was diagnosed with cancer four years ago.  She fought really, really hard, but in December it was deemed palliative.  At the time, she had two hospices here in Toronto picked out, but wanted to stay at home as long as possible.  So I quit my job to take care of her full-time.  At first it wasn't that big of an issue, mostly my job was making sure she didn't fall walking down the hallway of her home, but as the weeks went on, I started taking on more and more roles.  Housekeeper, Cook, Pharmacist (just making sure she got the medications she needed at the correct time/dosage was a job in itself!) Two weeks ago she took a sudden turn for worse.  She could no longer walk at all, so I became needed for helping her on and off the commode, she couldn't swallow, so I became responsible for giving her injections, she lost all sense of where she was/hallucinating, so I had to be there all the time to calm her down/try to explain what was happening.  There were a couple days where I received literally no sleep at all because she was so agitated.  I kept asking the doctor what I could do - although we had a doctor/nurse coming in daily, she was going downhill so fast, and I was so exhausted, I was snapping at everyone, and crying all the time.  The doctor said she was in her dying phase and I had two options - help her die at home, or put her in a hospital emergency ward since there were no beds at the hospice available.  I knew I wasn't going to be able to do it for much longer, but there was no way in hell I was going to let her die in the hallway of some hospital.

Fortunately that night I received a call from the hospice saying that they had moved her up the wait list, and that a bed would be ready for her the next morning.  I burst out in tears.  Not tears of sadness, but relief.  It was an emotional morning the next day watching her leave her home for the last time, with me knowing she was never coming back.  I'm not sure if she was aware of it, but there was one brief look she gave me as I was holding onto the doorframe near collapse with grief that told me she knew.  I rode in the ambulance with her all the way to the hospice.  

As soon as we got there the staff started making her a lot more comfortable then I was ever able to.  They're at her beck and call 24/7 getting her anything she wants.  They're able to shower and change her without the trouble/pain I had been putting her through, regulate her medicines better, etc.  The hospice she's in is beautiful, and nothing like a hospital at all.  I can bring her pets into visit her, hang up pictures of the family, even paint the walls.  I slept at the hospice with her the first night because I was worried she'd wake up confused as to where she was, but for the first time in over a week, she slept through the whole night - and so did I.  Such a weight was lifted off of my shoulders, I now can focus on being a daughter to her for her last few days rather than a nurse.  I will never forget what a help the hospice has been for both my mother, and to a greater extent, the rest of my family.  Sorry for the rant, but she just went in this week, and I hadn't told anyone this story yet.

conservativecowboy,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_n5c8w,2,c36gbyk,"I don't have any words of wisdom, but I can tell you what I went through when I had my first recurrence.

When I was first diagnosed, it was a rare form of breast cancer and it had already metastasized to numerous places. I was told there wasn't much that could be done. I could be treated, but it would be palliative rather than curative care. I moved heaven and earth to get myself up to speed on the disease, how to handle it and what to do. I went to the doctor for 63 straight weeks for labs and chemo and surgery and a bone marrow transplant and radiation and more of each. When I was finally done and came out the other side I was exhausted, but got the NED (No evidence of disease) talk from the oncologist, I was happy, but more relieved. I could go back to my life. The same life that had very suddenly been put on hold 15 months earlier. 

I went back to school and entered more road races and filled my calendar up just like it was before. And then my back started hurting.

Unlike other cancer patients, I chose not to undergo scans at periodic intervals. I believed and still do that the scans weren't going to tell me anything about the cancer that I wouldn't already know if I listened to my body. So my back was hurting for about two weeks and I called the onc. I headed in for an x-ray to be followed by a CT. 

I saw the xray and knew immediately there was new cancer. 

This was worse than the first diagnosis. Much, much, much worse. I had given it everything the first time. I had researched every course of treatment I had chosen and knew I had done everything I could and it wasn't enough. The fucking cancer was back. I had given every ounce of energy and thought to fighting this disease and it still wasn't enough. I can't emphasize enough how much this threw me. I didn't know if I had enough energy to take up the battle again. At least that was what I thought for the first week. Gradually I got my spunk back, but it was a good six weeks before I was truly ready to fight again. 

I don't know what your Dad is going through, but I can tell you the first recurrence I had was infinitely worse than the initial diagnosis of the disease for me. Maybe your Dad is feeling the same way. Also know that this isn't necessarily the end.

I've had six (I count five, but the onc does things differently) recurrences. It sucks, it takes a lot of time and energy and a part of you that requires you to dig down really, really deep into yourself to brace for yet another fight. But I've come out fine. I'm alive and well and April will make five years since my last recurrence.

Hugs to both of you.

there's a ""very small"" spot, but it's so difficult to access that a biopsy is almost as traumatic as the surgery and because he is a survivor, i guess the assumption is it's bad news.

he hasn't scheduled his surgery yet because he ""has some things to take care of""- things he would not elaborate on. he seems convinced that the surgery is going to be worse even than the kidney surgery (i don't know HOW that is even possible, they went in through the front because of the size of the tumor). he just started a new job about 2 months ago and i think he's afraid he'll lose it because of taking the time off. and i'm a little scared that he's just not going to schedule that surgery and he might just wander out into the woods with a shotgun and take care of this himself. that last one is pure speculation, but we're so close and he's really closing me out on this one and i don't understand why. 

i don't know what i'm doing here. just trying to get this off my chest, i suppose. i feel like i can't talk to anyone about it- my husband's father lost his battle with bone cancer the same year my dad had his kidney removed and i have a pretty bad case of survivor's guilt about the whole thing. i'm a jazz guitarist and thursday is my regular night to play with a couple of friends at a coffee shop, so i'm going to just try to have a good time and play off like this is regular, but i'm kind of freaking out. maybe if i don't feel better when i get done playing out, i can check this account and there might be some words of encouragement.

HunterGreen12,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_nrmz2,2,c3bhwyd,"Everyone reacts to chemotherapy differently, however her symptoms are by no means rare or uncommon. Numbness in the extremities as well as chemo-fog are common side-effects. 

Her complaints are legitimate. She is clearly feeling side-effects and it is impacting her and lowering her quality of life right now. If her cancer was more advanced or if this chemotherapy sequence was *palliative* (medical term for chemo that only improves quality of life/extends life but doesn't actually help cure the cancer), then I would say it is worth considering abandoning the treatment. **HOWEVER** since there is a short term goal (mastectomy) and since it is a major surgery with risks, not to mention that her cancer has not metastasized (spread to other organs), you want to make sure she understands that a few weeks of fog, suffering, pain, and low quality of life could be the *only* consequences of living the rest of her life cancer free. 

If she still wants to go without it, I would sit her down and ask her from the bottom of your heart to do it for you. She may hate you for it now, she may resent you for a little while, and she may even be angry at you during the process, but those are very small prices to pay when she has a very good chance of going into long-term remission with a successful mastectomy. 

Also, explain to her that if she doesn't go through this last sequence, the surgeon may not operate on her and may require her to go through additional sequences (more than one) before they consider another mastectomy. 

Ultimately, I agree with the other advice given in this thread: stay the course. If she does not agree with your reasoning, ask her to do it as a personal favor to you since she loves you. This is a significant decision. Consistent and complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemo before a surgery) could certainly make the difference between a successful surgery and a failed one.

Should I try to change her mind?,"My girlfriend is three courses in to a four course AC chemotherapy treatment for her breast cancer. The goal of the chemo is to shrink the tumors enough so that we'll have a clear margin for her followup mastectomy. 

She has gotten to the point where she's no longer wanting to suffer the side effects of chemo, and would rather just try to get the surgery and take her chances. I'm deeply concerned she's making a huge and unnecessary gamble.

She's complaining about a lot of things. She is experiencing peripheral numbness that no one seems to understand. She's also tired, irritable and suffering the dreaded ""chemo-fog"" which is leaving her unable to do much other than sit around wasting time on facebook. She also suffers crippling medical procedure phobias. I often feel like the only reason she's gotten any treatment whatsoever is because of my insistence. 

I'm getting very tired of feeling like I'm forcing her to get treated, and I understand there are cases where it's not worth the suffering. Her case is simply not one of these. If she gets pre and post operative chemo and hormone therapy, she has a better than 90% chance of total remission. 

I'm really at a loss here. I've had a lot of cancer caregiving experience (father, aunt and two grandparents). She's objectively much healthier and has a better prognosis than any of them, but she's suffering more than any of them did. Any advice would be appreciated.

**Update**:

The oncologists decided her last infusion of chemo could be delayed until she felt healthy enough to take it. Their reasoning is that her tumors have already responded well to chemo, and she is still going to get a mastectomy after it's done.  After a 4 week delay since the previous infusion, she had her final one a couple days ago.  So far she's doing well."
HunterGreen12,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_nrjyl,1,c3bhysm,"Total abstinence from drinking will give you the best statistical chance of a successful chemotherapy treatment. If the treatment you are undergoing is curative and the goal is long-term remission, I would highly suggest abstaining from alcohol consumption. Why? Because you'll end up in one of two situations: 1) You will go into remission and possibly be cured long term and you will be able to enjoy yourself without feeling like you ""missed out"" or 2) you will be in bed and in pain wondering ""would I be here if I had quit drinking.""


If your chemotherapy is palliative (i.e. if it is meant to increase your quality of life or extend it without actually curing the cancer), then it is a personal decision. I would still recommend reducing your alcohol intake, but I do understand the social aspect of drinking and enjoying time with your friends (I am 23). You may be able to find a balance. If you cut down your drinking, you may be able to reduce your tolerance a bit and still enjoy yourself with your friends.


All of that being said, this is the main point I want to make: you clearly have a supportive group of friends in your life who know about your disease and care for your well-being. Sit them down and talk to them. You don't need to tell them that everyone should stop drinking because of you, but you could just suggest to them to do other activities that don't necessarily involve drinking.

Her neck mass is most likely from metastatic disease which is spreading to the lymph nodes of either the low neck or the supraclavicular area. We frequently treat these areas palliatively with shorter courses of radiation therapy in order to prevent skin breakdown, swallowing or breathing trouble, etc.

Here is some back story. I work for a large county medical center. My Mom's primary care doctor kept blowing off a ""cold"" she had for 2 months. I begged and begged her to come in to our ER (as we treat and stabilize and bill later). She refused for about 4 more months. 


She finally called me the end of November and told me she was having shortness of breath. We got her all checked in and she ended up have a CT that showed she had metastasis in her heart, lung, and abdominal area. I was in shock to say the least. Fucked part was that it was her birthday. She was admitted and I had this jerk off of a doctor ALREADY trying to d/c home with hospice. I was outraged to say the least and raised hell to get a biopsy and a referral to Oncology. They d/c her with no results but a follow up appointment to the oncology clinic.


I took her in on Dec 23 and Oncology said she for sure has cancer that is stage 4, they need to do another biopsy to figure out what type. Meanwhile a neck mass that was once not noticeable is now huge and red. I naturally become alarmed and did everything imaginable to get her appointments pushed sooner.


She had a surgery appointment today for her biopsy and goes in tomorrow morning. Now the mass on her neck is oozing and look VERY painful. She has lost a total of 27 pounds. Like 10 since she was discharged. She has no appetite and is in a lot of pain. 


I just feel like I am in total limbo, they told her that her CA 125 level is very high, but she had a total hysterectomy 11 years ago. 


I am lost, I don't know what I need to do to help her. Am I doing enough?? 


tl;dr mom has some type of cancer that is stage 4. Getting run around from doctors."

It was not actually using referral to hospice but to palliative care specialists. Palliative care specialists are great, and should be involved early with terminal cancer. The difference between them and hospice, which is also great, is that you typically can't use chemotherapy during hospice and you need an expected life expectancy of less than 6 months. Palliative care specialists help in many ways like hospice but doesn't have these restrictions. They are both great at helping with your symptom control, improving quality of life, and helping the patient achieve his or her goals. Sometimes with the improvement in symptom control with palliative care, patients want more chemotherapy, and potentially achieve some better disease control with it. 

However, the main point for you is that I agree with OTN. Get involved with some palliative care specialists, hospice or independant ones. ",t3_pz99f,t1_c3tkwh5,2012-02-21 22:47:09,,,,

I haven't walked this path with a parent, but with my daughter.  With a four to six week prognosis after treatment failed, we were able to find the right balance of home care, pain control and interventions to allow some positive experiences and memory building.

I posted for opinions and advice and got some. I even posted for some help with a bucket list. That didn't go nearly as well as the advice but I wasn't really surprised. 

Nothing has seemed to go right since. His Dr said the chemo therapy isn't doing anything so they are going to take him off of it. Shit like that does much but it was going to give him an outlook of 7 months to a year. Now he is going to go anywhere from now till 6 months at most and that prognoses was made in January so I guess in June at the latest. I am not quite 30 and the oldest child in my family. I woke up tonight having a dream of my dad telling me he was going to die. It was the most real and vivid dream I have ever had and I woke up crying and luckily stopped after 10 minutes. I hate cancer I hate everything about it. My dad is changed so much in the past couple of weeks to the point now of him not being lucid at all. 

The Dr's have him on so much morphine now that he is either sleeping or mumbling all the time. I cant have a conversation with him anymore and he is so cold. His hands are like ice. I have no idea how that is even possible. My dad most likely wont make it to his 60th birthday and I feel upset now every time I see an elderly person. I feel jealous and sad and I hope to god their loved ones spend some time with them cause man what I would give to see my dad to grow old, really old not 59.

I don't know what I am asking for or saying in all of this. I feel bad for my mom and dad, my father was adopted and his real family never reached out to him. His adopted mom is alive but has Alzheimer's and would never understand what's going on. Ugh I am sorry for the rambling and uncertainty of this message.

i've been really strong about holding it together for my mom and just to be able to get through work and school, etc. but my dad was just put on palative care.. aka hospice.

OTN,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_tbu4o,7,c4lir4a,"Radiation oncologist here. 

Radiation therapy is used very frequently in lung cancer, either with palliative (relief of symptoms) or curative intent. If your mom's lung cancer is stage III, she still has a chance at cure and I would strongly recommend attempt at curative treatment with chemoradiation therapy. 'Eastern' medicine has been shown to have some slight benefit with respect to symptom control, but it has negligible anti-tumor effect. With curative-dose radiation therapy there will be symptoms to manage, however, the most common being irritation of the esophagus and lethargy. 

If her cancer has spread to the bones, it would be Stage IV and radiation could help with bone pain with very minimal side effects. There would be a 65% chance it could completely take her pain away and another 20% chance on top of that it could substantially reduce her pain- 85% chance of good benefit total. 

You can tell them they use radiation therapy all over China, India, Thailand, Singapore, etc, etc along WITH traditional 'Eastern' remedies for side effect purposes.  ",t3_tbu4o,t1_c4lir4a,2012-05-08 13:56:42,,,Stage 3 lung cancer + pain in body/bones + Eastern medicine?,"Hi r/cancer,

My mom was diagnosed with stage 3 (1 year ttl) lung cancer last week (by her GP? or oncologist?). The week before, an xray showed one of her lungs filled with liquid. The doctors drained it, but the cause is inconclusive (the cancer? heart problems?). She's had a bad cough and has been complaining of body/bone pains for the last year, so I imagine it's been a long time coming (I'd imagine the cancer has spread to her bones?).

She's going to see an oncologist for more information this week, but my dad and her were pretty determined that they wanted to stick with Eastern medicine to fight the cancer. She's not expecting to survive (a long time) and they were concerned that chemo/radiation (a doc [GP?] already ruled out surgery) would just be hurting her body even more (quality of life during her final year/years). The downside is that she'll likely continue to have her body and bone pains. I'm concerned they'll get worse.

I'm curious if there's anything I can look into that might help her with her pains/make her more comfortable?

Anyhow, I'll start looking through the sidebar links after work.

Not a bad idea to get it in the chart at whatever hospital you will be using, and, if family issues get really bad, keep a copy with you. 

Get an appointment with a palliative care specialist. There whole job is to help achieve patient's goals and wishes and control their symptoms. Sounds like exactly what she needs.

One of the things to remember, too, is that brain metastases are pretty common in late stage lung cancer, so neurological problems might arise from that. Also be aware that lung cancer can cause your father to lose his voice, which can be pretty hard.

In terms of end of life care, go with hospice, though be aware that most, but not all insurance covers it. The setting will likely be much nicer than a hospital, with more privacy and usually a much larger room, which will be important when visitors come. When the end comes, they're generally better with morphine than hospitals.

Also, as others have said, get a DNR. You don't want them to needlessly resuscitate your father. I'd also advise you not to put your father on life support. Life support is for people that have a chance of recovery. For people that are dying, all it will do is prolong suffering and leave you with the difficult decision of when to remove it.

Also be sure to say the things you need to say to your dad, and do it sooner rather than later.

huckflen,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_z20i5,1,c60z9mv,"First, I'm really, truly sorry.  My grandmother (who raised me, with my parents) died of a massive brain tumor.  I took care of her until she was bed-ridden, so this hits close to home.  Cancer sucks, period, but brain tumors are horrifying.  They rob you of speech, motor skills, and bodily functions.  =(  

Hospice is a wonderful thing, though.  I hope you &amp; your gf see the good in this - they provide the support and medical care needed, and really, they know what they're doing.  If you have questions or need to talk, you *can* ask them.  They are truly there to help.  

So as far as your lady goes... dude, you don't need to make her feel better.  You don't  need to have encouraging words - in fact, too much encouragement might just piss her off and push her away.  

I say that because last year, my dad died.  He had a semi-rare blood cancer, and after about 4 1/2 years of battling it, he'd had enough.  It was terminal and his life was shit, and he was just done.  He went into palliative care, which quickly turned to in-home hospice, and lasted about 2 weeks.  All I wanted was to curl inside myself and mourn.  

When my mom called to tell me he was going into hospice, my world shattered.  I sobbed uncontrollably, because I understood what that meant for my dad.  Not everyone in hospice dies, but with my dad... it meant no more transfusions, which meant he'd die.  UGH.  

My hubs is an amazing dude, and I don't know what I'd have done without him.  But he tried to get me to see the positive, and tried to comfort me and tell me it'd be okay, that he probably wasn't going to die.  While I appreciated the sentiment and his support - appreciate is a far cry from how much I needed it - dude... my dad's got no blood, he weighs 90 pounds, and he's going into hospice and stopping transfusions. Yes, he is going to die.  

Sometimes, just accepting that really shitty things are afoot is the best option - at least for me.  *Everyone is different*, and you know your girlfriend.  Use your knowledge wisely! 

Now, I have no idea what condition your gf's mom is in.  I sincerely, truly hope that she'll make it, and get better, and everything turns up roses.  I'd never wish the pain of cancer &amp; loss upon anyone.  

But really, for support?  Be there.  Hug her if she needs it.  If she needs to be left alone, leave her alone, but make her aware you're there if she needs you.  Do little things for her - like make dinner, or do the housework, take her out to a night of something fun to take her mind off things, if she's down for it. 

And if her mom does pass, well... everyone grieves differently.  Remember that.  And the loss of a parent is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't experienced it.  I've lost two, now.  My grandma, who was right there with my parents as I grew up.   And now my dad, who I was very close to... I'm a lot like him.  I look like him.  I am definitely my dad's kid.   Last year, when he passed, I pretty much blacked out several months.  I know I lived them, but ask for details, and I've got jack shit to offer.  I just glossed over them, and kind of woke up around Christmas.   When my mom dies someday, the world may actually implode.  It's *that* hard, no embellishment needed.  

If you need to talk, or just need to vent, or whatever - feel free to PM me.  But as far as I can tell... dude, you're doing it right.  You're present, you've made yourself available, and you just want to help.  Sometimes, there's just nothing you can do to fix it, or make it better, so being there is what matters most.

This post is written from the scraps of information I've picked up from what little my gf can bear to talk about, and putting finger-to-keyboard and listing all her problems can make some info unclear or unorganized. I'll also update for clarity if necessary. Thank you all for taking the time to read and for helping out. 

EDIT: I expected to make a thank-you edit to you guys for the awesome advice. Instead, well....her mom died in hospice care this morning. She'd like to be left alone, so I decided to take this little free time to make this edit. Despite all this, still, thank you guys so much. I'm adhering to your guidelines to the best of my ability, and she truly appreciates it. My thoughts and prayers are there with those still fighting!!"
Yazars,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_z483p,1,c620wdx,"Given the history you've provided, there's a pretty reasonable chance it's cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).  You did not explicitly say that the MRI he had was specifically protocoled to assess liver lesions, although it probably was.  I respectfully disagree with some things you wrote:
&gt;There's really no sure way to tell if it is cancer because the blood test for it isn't accurate

Possibly, but if, for example, the AFP is sky high &amp; the imaging findings have classic enhancements consistent with liver cancer, it would be enough information to make a diagnosis without a biopsy.

&gt; At his age, a biopsy is out of the question.

Why?  Depending on the location, a CT-guided needle biopsy may diagnose a disease for which he could receive palliative therapy to maintain his quality of life for as long as possible.  Options that would not involve body-wide chemotherapy options could include chemoembolization and stereotactic radiation therapy.  The choice is up to him and the family, but in my opinion you're jumping ahead and deciding not to do treatment too early.  Maybe you didn't mean to say that, since if you all have agreed to not want him to undergo tests and treatment, why would you even bother to see a liver specialist unless it would potentially guide management?",t3_z483p,t1_c620wdx,2012-09-01 19:56:30,,,What are your opinion on my dad's situation?,"My dad contracted Hep C when he visited our homeland over ten years ago. As a result, he has developed cirrhosis. A recent ultrasound, and later confirmed by an MRI, shows he has a 3.8"" cm tumor in his liver. My dad is at an age where we have agreed as a family to not put him through tests and treatment where he would have to suffer. His body probably wouldn't be able to take it anyways. We're going to see a liver specialist next week, but from what I've read on Google, this doesn't look good as it is probably Hepatoma (liver cancer). There's really no sure way to tell if it is cancer because the blood test for it isn't accurate, and the presence of cirrhosis makes it difficult to rely on imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.). At his age, a biopsy is out of the question.

The signs are all there, and my gut tells me it is the big C. But I'm hoping maybe someone can chime in and tell me there's a chance it's just another lesion (from cirrhosis) and it isn't cancerous. :("
dvdrdiscs,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_c620wdx,1,c622csd,"The reason why we've elected to not do any procedures and/or treatment is because of what we went through with my mom. She passed away in April from lung cancer. Leading up to her passing, she went through bouts and bouts of chemo, radiation, and invasive procedures. It is one of the biggest regret that we as a family have in regards to my mom's illness. She spent the last few weeks/months going through all of the treatments instead of just simply enjoying her remaining days without all of the symptoms from it. We believe she would have even lived a little bit longer if her body wasn't destroyed from the radiation.

Drawing on our experience, and also it's my dad's wish, we don't want to do anything at my dad's age (88). Reading up on liver cancer, stemming from Hep C, it's incurable anyways. The only reason why we're seeing a specialist is to have a better gauge of how much longer he has to live. I will discuss what you have suggested with my family and see if it's an option. Ultimately, the goal is to get a good indication of how far along the cancer is (if it's cancer) and then determine how much longer my dad has so we can plan accordingly for him to be comfortable. Palliative care, and eventually hospice, will hinge on the timetable we get.

My daughter required hospice for the last 3 weeks of her life and they were wonderful.  We refused to have our daughter moved to a hospice care house and we were able to keep her at home as well as keep her comfortable.  We had a nurse who came every day at first and then once or twice a week (as needed) to make sure her meds were keeping her comfortable.  They delivered the O2 condenser that we used as well as extra tanks so we could take her to the movies with her sisters.  The hospice company also offered support for the whole family via counselors and musical and play therapy for the children.  

Once you get hospice in place, it is VERY important that you stand firm on what your cousins wishes are.  Talk to your cousin about how they want to be cared for, do they want a DNR? What are your cousins wishes regarding burial/cremation?  We talked with our daughter and she shared how she wanted to pass and what she wanted for her body afterwards.  Our daughter picked out her urn and told us when she passed she wanted to be held and hugged.  

Because we had open communication with our daughter and because we stood firm to her wishes and our family wishes, she was able to pass at home in the manner she wished to go.

The radiation would probably involve one appointment to do a CT scan of his head, make a mask to hold his head in place for the treatment. Then a wait of about one week while they make a plan followed by 10 treatments (once per day for 2 weeks, no weekends). The table he has to lay on for treatment is hard, but if he is still in good shape he should do fine. 

I personally would think about it if he is still feeling good because it can delay mental symptoms for some time. If he is already feeling like he's going downhill fast, then he may want to skip it.

abnormalerror,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_c75bi26,3,c75kg72,"&gt;All diet based ""cures"" and treatment comes from subjective studies at best, and snake oil salesmen at worse.

I was not speaking about a ""cure"", but a hope to keep the cancer from growing as aggressively.

Regardless of what action I should take on the questions I posted initially, I cannot believe that asking someone to go on a low-carb or high-fat/0-carb diet was such a worthless exercise. As far as I was aware, many cancer doctors endorse a low-carb diet.

Why is pumping someone full of chemo considered acceptable (when it's so toxic), when this method is at best a palliative treatment but advocating a change of diet with a lot of scientific backing considered anathema?

Scientific backing:

* [Is there a role for carbohydrate restriction in the treatment and prevention of cancer?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662) 

Here are the conclusions from the last link:

&gt;We summarize our main findings from the literature regarding the role of dietary CHO restriction in cancer &gt;development and outcome.

&gt;(i) Most, if not all, tumor cells have a high demand on glucose compared to benign cells of the same tissue and conduct glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect). In addition, many cancer cells express insulin receptors (IRs) and show hyperactivation of the IGF1R-IR pathway. Evidence exists that chronically elevated blood glucose, insulin and IGF1 levels facilitate tumorigenesis and worsen the outcome in cancer patients.

&gt;(ii) The involvement of the glucose-insulin axis may also explain the association of the metabolic syndrome with an increased risk for several cancers. CHO restriction has already been shown to exert favorable effects in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Epidemiological and anthropological studies indicate that restricting dietary CHOs could be beneficial in decreasing cancer risk.

&gt;(iii) Many cancer patients, in particular those with advanced stages of the disease, exhibit altered whole-body metabolism marked by increased plasma levels of inflammatory molecules, impaired glycogen synthesis, increased proteolysis and increased fat utilization in muscle tissue, increased lipolysis in adipose tissue and increased gluconeogenesis by the liver. High fat, low CHO diets aim at accounting for these metabolic alterations. Studies conducted so far have shown that such diets are safe and likely beneficial, in particular for advanced stage cancer patients.

&gt;(iv) CHO restriction mimics the metabolic state of calorie restriction or - in the case of KDs - fasting. The beneficial effects of calorie restriction and fasting on cancer risk and progression are well established. CHO restriction thus opens the possibility to target the same underlying mechanisms without the side-effects of hunger and weight loss.

&gt;(v) Some laboratory studies indicate a direct anti-tumor potential of ketone bodies. During the past years, a multitude of mouse studies indeed proved anti-tumor effects of KDs for various tumor types, and a few case reports and pre-clinical studies obtained promising results in cancer patients as well. Several registered clinical trials are going to investigate the case for a KD as a supportive therapeutic option in oncology.",t3_13m9zj,t1_c75kg72,2012-11-23 11:06:19,,,,
Travellerknight,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_c75kg72,3,c76h6w4,"Hi there sorry its taken me so long to reply, but honestly I have other things to work on. I see you decided to bring in some articles to ""support"" your claim, honestly I don't believe they are helping argue your case. Furthermore to cover my case.

Lancet oncology, 2006, volume 7, issue 12 - ""Diet, exercise, and complementary therapies after primary treatment for cancer""

Majority of the article is about the use of diet after treatment, but it does explain a bit of information in regard to diet and treatment. The authors main argument that a change of diet has no real affect on treatment however it uses are more in the psychological effect of providing the patient a source of mental control, in that they feel they are contributing and helping to tackle the disease, as opposed to being passive to it. It does warn doctors to be aware and make sure the patient isn't going to crazy with it, and make sure they have a balanced diet.

Your arguing however to unbalance the diet, this will cause no benefit to the patient, and will potentially make them weaker, potentially affecting how the treatment works.


Supportive Care in Cancer - October 2005, Volume 13, Issue 10, pp 806-811 ""Prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use in cancer patients during treatment"" Another article, here they argue the inherent danger associated with Alternative treatments, they argue that a cancer diagnosis is a terrifying process for patients to comprehend, mixed with from a patients prospective the lack of empathy from their doctor, they are more likely to turn to people or friends who offer ways to enhance or ""cure"" their disease, because these people appear to show more empathy and talk down on traditional treatment and essentially providing the patient with false hope, which is very dangerous as it can lead to increase patients suffering.


Finally I decided to look into ketogenic diet from my own research. The only article I could find was:

International Journal of Radiation Oncology BiologyPhysics
Volume 78, Issue 3, Supplement, 1 November 2010, Pages S114–S115 - ""Enhancing Tumor Chemo-radio-sensitization using Ketogenic Diets""

Ok firstly this is not a research paper, it is an oral presentation, and much of the work is largely theoretical. Straight of the bat i've got this quote ""It has been hypothesized that cancer cells exist in a state of chronic oxidative stress with the site of pro-oxidant production being mitochondrial electron transport chains"". The word Hypothosized automatically should ring alarm bells for you. At this moment in time, cancer is still largely an unknown area, where we are not quite sure where everything reacts and what causes things to happen (spontaneous regression, which does occur is completely unknown how or why it does it is one example), therefore what these scientists are doing is on the extreme fringe of even theoretical benefits to humans.

secondly as we have learned painfully before that what works with mice and animals might not necessarily work with us humans, while we are both mammals, there are distinct differences in food intake, food digestion and even cancer growth. I personally would take more attention if the research was linked to its use in primates, which are even closer to use biologically, it would at least make me more comfortable to take something so experimental

Finally the concluding quote from the article states ""These experiments support the hypothesis that ketogenic diets may increase systemic oxidative stress and enhance tumor chemo-radio-sensitization"" - The main things to take from the quote are ""may increase"" (we don't know) and that its use is only to enhance standard treatments already used, and in regards to your friend, the most likely options open to him with pancreatic disease is palliative radiotherapy and palliative chemotherapy, neither of which will have significant benefit with a KD diet.

sorry this is long, probably horribly formatted and full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, I am doing this while doing research for my master's.

Share.  its like an easy way to be in a support group for this new unknown path you and your dad.  the people in here are amazing and full of great info, advice, everything.  i might not be one of them, but here is my take on it all.

My dad died last week, age 60.  He smoked 2 packs Newports for 40 years so right off the bat, his lung cancer was different in that his smoking directly caused it, docs word.

Last september we went up for his 60th birthday, and i noticed he had lost weight.  we both figured it was from the massive stress from his home situation and that he walked his dog 5 miles a day up and down hills.  So, this past December he ended up in the hospital due to what he thought was a lung infection or pneumonia or something.  He texted me and said they found a mass in his lung, and were going to do the whole series of scans and tests. After some initial mis diagnosis of a stage 1, he went to a proper big city cancer hospital and was CT scanned and diagnosed with stage 4b.  merry christmas.  radiation and chemo began (palliative but still with hopes for slowing or stopping the spread)

My wife and kids and i flew up in mid jan.  He was in bad shape.  lost an extreme amount of weight.  something to do with not realizing he had too much calcium, and it really fucked him up.  Anyway, i made my peace with him that trip, thinking, it could be any week/month.  but in his camp, they kept thinking they could get a full year out of him.  
We go up again in april, he gained weight, looked better on the outside, but was not doing well.  The pain.  it spread to his bones mainly and that caused him great pain all the time.  he kept fighting and kept with the chemo.  

He got his review scans 2 weeks ago.  the doctors said the chemo had pissed the cancer off, and it had taken over his body.  it was everywhere.  it was time for home hospice.  When he finally agreed that the fight was over in his mind, it was like a switch turned off with him.  every day his condition worsened, compounded, and within a week, he died.
He must have had cancer for a year or longer before that September trip for his birthday, it explains his weight loss, his attitude, everything.  Too stubbord to get checked out sooner.  so, when he was properly diagnosed with stage 4, it took 4 months.

I would say to you these things.

Love him.  support what ever he wants to do with his medical care and action plans.  Get scanned like he was an alien from space, and then get second opinions from a hospital that specializes in cancer.  If its an early stage, then you got time, but fucking use it wisely.  

every persons cancer is different and every person has a different path with different outcomes, so no one is going to give you the answer your really want to here.  no one knows, they all take educated guesses.  If you live close to him, fantastic, hang out, do things, love him.  If you dont live close like i did, then see him soon, plan for the best but expect the worse when it comes to how much time you have.

gooch3803,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1ds2ii,3,c9tb7di,"I'm assuming your brother stopped taking his methadone all at once? Methadone is a drug that takes a while to build up in your system and you MUST be tapered off of. If he stopped taking the Methadone all at once then he is probably in withdrawals and very much looks like he is dying. That's not to say that he isn't dying as withdrawals on a patient with late stage cancer can be very taxing on the body. 
Advice? You can do two things, keep trying to convince him to go to the doctor, or you can accept his decision and support him. (Given I don't know anything about your brothers condition medically) If he does go to the doctor it would be my guess that they would suggest him to palliative or hospice care, both are great services. No matter what, be there for him and support him. If you are going to try to get him help don't force him, guide him, but it may be that the most you can do is to try and make him happy.

The_Gage,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_c9vgupd,2,c9vhasu,"Hey, yeah, no problem.  I just hope I was able to give you a bit more information on the subject. 

So I did a little bit more reading on parasinus tumors, and it looks like chemotherapy is generally reserved for palliative care.  In other words, chemo is usually given when the tumor has metastasized to distant organs like bone or liver and is causing pain or some other side effect.  It's usually not given to prevent metastasis.  In the future, if your friend has the misfortune of having to go through that, they'll probably give bleomycin, which is a type of chemotherapy drug. It has an impressive list of side effects, making it not very good for treating someone prophylactically. 

I am currently in remission and have been so for nearly eight years.  Two more years and I'll be considered fully cured. 

My radiotherapy experience was slightly different from what your friend will experience as my cancer required a very high dose and wasn't near anything too critical; my tumor was in my leg.  I was treated five times a week for eight weeks.  I'd walk down to the radiation therapy wing, lay on a table in a large room with a radiation emitter on a gantry. The gantry would swing around over the course of about 15 seconds, and I was done. Total time in the hospital was about 10 minutes each session.

Radiation therapy is extremely well targeted; a good therapist can place the exact amount of radiation required into a very specific area at a very specific depth. They usually try to use wide margins, meaning that they'll treat the area in which the tumor was found as well as the healthy tissue around it to make sure they include any possible tumor cells.  For your friend, this is difficult due to all the very important things that surround your sinuses, like the eye, the nerves, and the brain. To prevent spread, they'll likely immobilize his head during treatment, and may even sync the therapy with his breathing to further prevent unneeded damage. 

During treatment, most people feel very tired and get something akin to a sunburn on the treatment area. This usually results in some scarring after treatment, which will vary based on the radiation dose.  I never got too tired, but due to the high dose, the skin on my leg sloughed off and I have a significant level of scarring in the area.  Everything else works great though. 

Let me know if you have any other questions, thoughts, or concerns about the treatment options. I love talking about this stuff.

Yazars,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_c9voqf5,1,c9w0q0g,"&gt; Try to convince your stepmom to at least try chemotherapy. 

This would be the wrong answer on boards.  One must respect patient autonomy.  If she's had decision making capacity, has been properly informed of her options, and has declined therapy up to this point for what is an almost certainly incurable disease, that decision should be respected.  What others have said is correct though; [there are pretty tolerable chemotherapies for breast cancer](http://hemonc.org/wiki/Breast_cancer), or certain types can benefit from just hormonal or anti HER-2 therapy.

There are potentially some interventions that could help out from a supportive care standpoint if there is biliary obstruction.  If hospice/palliative isn't already involved, that could be a helpful thing for her since they can help manage symptoms well without directly dealing with the underlying cancer.",t3_1dx2ja,t1_c9w0q0g,2013-05-10 06:38:23,,,,
tindahalx,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1ee4f4,2,c9zeefg,"In most cases of blood cancers; patients either die due to 1) the cancer itself when it encroaches on bone marrow function. This is when (in this case malignant plasma cells) fill up all the space within the bone marrow. As a result you get anaemia (less red cell) and a weak immune system (plasma cells are immature and have little function so other white cells can't form). As a result, you can end up dying of infections despite all the antibiotics.

2) You can die from the chemotherapy itself, which is basically a non-specific toxin that eradicates the cancer cells. Chemo has loads of side effects like nausia, fatigue and what not. Ironically, some people feel much worse due to the chemo than if they were to just leave the cancer alone (and die pretty soon after)

Since she had myeloma, I assume you mother is over 65 year old? Unfortunately, since the cancer returned even after the transplant, the prognosis is not that good, especially in older people. It saddens me to say that most people at that stage may either die with the aggressive treatment whilst other doctors may decide to stop treatment and resort to palliative care. So you sort of know the answer, you either die from infections or due to the side effects of chemo. 

I really hope this information is helpful to you, please be strong, i'm sure there is still some time left. Goodluck to your family.

huckflen,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1fadkm,1,ca94zhi,"((((hugs)))) I'm really, really sorry about your dad.  My own has been gone 2 years as of June 11th, and I miss him every single day.  My mom was his primary caretaker, so I might be able to give a little insight here.  Like your mom, mine is fairly self-sufficient, in that she doesn't like to put the burden of info on others - she'll just keep it to herself until it's out of her ability to handle it.  =/ 

If your dad isn't enrolled in a palliative care program, I *strongly* urge you to consider this.  Talk to your parents, specifically your dad, because this is central to *quality of life*, which is THE most important thing in a terminal situation.  If you can't beat it, at least be comfortable, you know?  Palliative care can often seamlessly transition into hospice - it did for my dad.  Medicaid/medicare are *awesome* resources for this, especially if he's already on disability.  

Palliative services will often go to the patient's home a couple of times a week to check on things, do stuff that involves needles (my dad required injections of a bone marrow boosting med), and generally provide support to the patient AND the family.  And this is frequently a service offered for free, or at little cost, with health insurance.  My dad was on full disability and my parents paid $0 for his palliative/hospice care and medications related to that care.  

One other thing these folks do is not really a happy topic, but it's important.  When your dad does pass, you make *one* phone call to the hospice folks, and they take care of his body.  They're professional, gentle, and very respectful of the hell you'll be going through.  They will clean him up, get him dressed if needed, and put him into a physical state that is acceptable for loved ones to say their final goodbyes, if you're up for that.  They'll also handle transport to a funeral home.  No sirens or attention drawn.  Our hospice folks rolled up in a minivan.  VERY discreet.  

As for your mom?  Oh, man... it's hard.  I'm not going to sugar coat it, this fucking SUCKS.  My parents were married 42+ years before he passed away in her arms, and she is LOST without him.  This is a shitty situation for everyone, I know, but it's one of those things she'll need to approach on her own.  

Before he passes, make sure she has time away.  I know that sounds cold, but it is SO important for caregivers to get a break.  Take her out to dinner every couple of weeks.  Go to a movie together.  Shop for baby stuff together.  Just a couple of hours is a *huge* emotional boost for people taking care of the dying.  

As far as living together?  Well... is this going to be a situation where you're sharing the *entire* house, or is there a mother-in-law space for her, so it's a separated situation?  If possible, separate is better!  This is a topic near to me, because it's tradition in my family that the daughter takes the mom into her home when the mom is retiring/has lost her husband.  I'm the first generation where it hasn't happened yet.

However, without a bit of knowledge into how your relationship with your mom is, that's a reaaaaally tough question to answer.  My mom &amp; I are extremely close, but if we had to live together, we'd kill each other for sure.  I adore her, I admire her, I very much respect her... but there's a reason I moved out!  ;)  

If it's going to be a huge burden on you guys, if you don't get along with her super well, if your *husband* isn't okay with it... maybe consider looking into senior living communities she'd be able to afford?  There are a lot of them that allow medicare/Medicaid funding, and if you happen to be in the greater Seattle area, hit me up - my mom works in the elder care industry, so I can get you *tons* of local resources for this.  =) 

Aside from all of that... if there's anything specific you want to know, feel free to ask it.  It sounds like we have somewhat similar familial situations here (but no baby on our side), and I'm happy to share whatever you want to ask.  ((hugs)) ",t3_1fadkm,t1_ca94zhi,2013-05-30 23:33:37,,,,

Her Chemo is purely palliative now, to suppress the symptoms of the tumors and try to retard its growth; problem with her tumors is that they are constantly changing, they morph from what looks like a standard tumor into what appears to be a benign tumor then back again... But they aren't shrinking as fast as treatment should allow, he body is takin resistance up quickly to treatment.

This is most likely her second fight against this, the first time she was given the all clear after a years worth of chemo, then it came back with a passion. I use the words 'all clear' with some cynicism, because I don't think the doctor knew what he was saying.

Surgery for her is NOT an option, the tumors in her spine are too small and numerous to remove and run the risk of paralysis.

I have a meeting with my oncological surgeon on the 18th and I find out if I am doing another round of chemo or if I have the potential for surgery because the previous round of chemo worked. 

Radiation is no longer an option as I have received my allotment for life as my oncologist jokes. (She knows I can take a joke.)  It is up in the air as to whether or not it has spread further or gotten smaller. Cancer always seems to be a waiting game so I fill it with adventures with my wife, friends and family. 

I was originally told by my oncologist surgery was not an option and that I didn't have much time left. I didn't listen and told her I was different. That was four months ago. I have proven her wrong about a number of things since my diagnosis. I am still eating regardless of the pain. I am not bedridden. I am on no pain meds. I made it through chemo with my beard, hair and no nausea. I keep striving to prove them wrong at every turn. 

If I can have surgery I will be ecstatic. But I could die in surgery as I will lose the lower third of my esophagus, the top half of my stomach and my celiac lymph nodes and some surrounding tissue. They will cut me from the bottom of my breast bone to my belly button and then from that incision under my ribcage all the way around either the left or right side. This should terrify me but I am excited at the prospect, at the chance at being cancer free. If it is in a lung they can take it I only need one, if it is in part of my liver they can take that too, it grows back. I would rather roll the dice and take a chance than regret never taking it at all.
 
If I have to do another round of chemo I will soldier on through it because unfortunately it will be my second and final shot at beating this before being forced into palliative care. That is right I only get two shots at this and I've already used one. Such is the unfortunate nature of my cancer. Beyond that I hate the term palliative, I am not suffering and this will not be the end of my life, not until I say so.

For me this has been a life altering experience and has changed my perspective on my own mortality and how I treat others. I have watched my wife, friends and family fall apart emotionally only to have to pick them up and say I can be the rock in the storm for a while, lean on me and let me shoulder both our burdens. I remind them that having this constant potential death sentence doesn't mean I am dead yet. They too have reminded me of this when I have started to falter.

 For me, for them, for everyone who has suffered through cancer; I will be damned if I don't go the distance and give everything I have, down to my very last moments, to prove that I won't be beaten without the greatest fight of my life. And I will enjoy every moment of it because it means I am still alive.

But when it's a matter of approaching the end and wanting to do the dying on your own terms, as we all try to do the rest of life, I see no problem with it. The difficulty in the hearts of others is that, they just don't want to see you go. At all. Ever.  And that's a good thing. It just means you have to meet them there, and they have to respect your final wishes. I don't know if your family is religious, and has that kind of reservation about end of life suicide. That would make them more difficult to convince. But you might ask them why God would require you to suffer more than you have, to make them suffer, and to spend gobs of money on intensive care that carries no promise of healing, but only of prolongation of suffering. Palliative and hospice care are wonderful, better options, if you and your doctor can't find a way to walk on on your own terms.

There are palliative steps that can be taken to keep him comfortable and maximize the quality of life for the time he has left . . . systemic chemotherapy to slow down the growth of the cancer and prolong survival, surgical management of biliary duct or duodenal obstruction, pain management, dietary management, nausea/vomiting management, as well as the spiritual and psychosocial aspects of living with cancer.

I could have almost written this six months and one day ago. My dad passed away this morning, due to liver failure caused by stomach cancer that metastasized to his liver and eventually other areas. 

My mom wasn't in as strong of denial as it sounds like yours is, but...From the beginning, we knew what the statistics were, and any chemo was purely palliative and he was not expected to be cured. Starting in the early days after the diagnosis and for the next several months, I noticed that time and time again my mom (on the blog I set up for her to update friends and family) had this overly chirpy optimistic tone about how things were going and dad was able to putt at the range and wasn't that nice etc... It hurt to watch that happen since at the same time, mentally I was preparing myself for his death and I felt like I couldn't talk to her about the realities.

At least for my mom, she got over the chirpy bubbly stuff eventually... It just took her a while. And in the last two weeks before he died (chemo stopped in late July due to a tumor causing a buildup of bilirubin in his system, basically liver failure), after months of being his sole caretaker, she finally accepted 24/7 help and we hired two 12 hour shift caretakers to ease the load for her. I think for her it was partly a generational thing (she is in her 70s and saving face and looking put together are important) and partly because for her it was just just so awfully painful to admit he was slipping away from us, as she and my dad had been married 47 years.

Anyway sorry to ramble... I would say just give her time, each person deals with this horrible thing differently and follows through the steps on their own timeline.

Good luck... Hug them both a lot.",t3_1ktqh8,t1_cbst2pp,2013-08-22 04:29:28,,,,

I've not been through what you're going through. All I can draw upon is my 3rd party observation of this. My mother recently made the decision to switch to palliative care after over a decade of chemos, surgeries, remissions, additional metastasis, chemo, remission, etc. She's extremely grateful for the years the chemo and maintenance drugs have given her, of course. But the last 2 rounds of chemo sapped her spirit entirely, and made little to no impact on the cancer (breast cancer). 

She's done with that - she's recovered well enough from her last chemo attempt that she's fairly strong and capable of living life well. She wants to live as best she can without further attempts at remission. I fully support her decision. It's heartbreaking, because I cannot imagine a world without her, but it was awful to see her so despondent, and in so much pain. Her quality of life has improved tremendously as she's healed from chemo, and as Hospice has come into her life. She can travel, see friends, and try to come to peace with the rest of the journey. We don't know - she may have another decade ahead (unlikely, but not impossible. There's just no way to know)

That being said, if she could do it all over again, she would not change anything. Lots of wonderful things happened in her life over the past decade that she might have missed without treatment. It's an incredibly difficult decision, and it is **your** decision to make. My mother has had some conflicts with friends who just don't understand it at all. She's trying to educate them, but they hurt at the thought of her (and everyone's) mortality.

I'm not telling you any of this to help you make your decision. I just want to let you know that there are people out there who do understand. And that I'm rooting for you to find peace, either way. I'm terribly sorry you're faced with this. Cancer is a hateful thing, and it's not fair.

If you do decide to stop treatment, and if Hospice is available to you, please, please, please get in touch with them. They are no longer just a service for people who are mere weeks away from death. They will support you the moment you stop treatment of a terminal disease, and their services will evolve with your situation, and they will stay with you for the duration. They will provide support to your family. They will encourage and help you live your life well (travel? no problem. move? no problem.) They are amazing.",t3_1lra6h,t1_cc27f6c,2013-09-05 14:06:18,,,,

When my husband was diagnosed with a glioblastoma, it was very hard to break the news to our children. My children were older (18 and 23) but we sat them down and told them gently and honestly what the diagnosis was and what it meant. I tried to see it as an opportunity for us, as a family, to make the time left as good as possible for my husband. We didn't plan any big trips or start a bucket list, we just spent lots of time together as a family. My children showed maturity beyond their years. 

My advice is to spend time with your wife, daughter, parents, and friends. As hard as it is, tell your wife what you want the end to look like (life support? palliative care? At home? Hospice?). 

One supplement to consider is Arginine. It has been found that glioblastoma tumor patients experience systemic immunosuppression that is caused by increased levels of arginase (enzyme that breaks down arginine). Taking oral, over the counter supplements of arginine can help to reduce that immunosuppression, strengthening your immune system. It is believed that arginine restores the function of t-cells in your body (natural tumor fighters in our bodies).

First: Be kind to yourself. This is important. Your head is already feeling very full and heavy and ready to explode. You need to find a place to vent, or a routine that is just for you that you can go to to distract yourself from the pain and stress. Something that will keep you grounded and clear-headed.

Secondly: Find Hospice. Talk to your mom about that. Hospice will counsel her, and you, and your dad, and whomever to get through this somehow. They will visit her at home and provide sound palliative care to her. They will keep her as comfortable as possible. They will provide respite care so you (and her other caregivers) can have a little time ""off"". If you'd like, someone will come to her for free to discuss what they do. You no longer wait until the very end to call them - they will be with her from the moment she decides not to pursue options that may or may not extend her life (which it sounds like is the case).

I wish I had more substantial ways to help you. I'm a caregiver for my mother who is on Hospice, so that's where I'm coming from.

Your dad needs to talk to someone - a social worker, or someone who can help him get through this. He is not your responsibility - just focus on your mom and your siblings for now.

beamseyeview,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1s0x5x,5,cdt7a31,"Metastatic adenocarcinoma with bone and liver mets is not a curable disease. As you said though, treatment is able to offer her palliation of her symptoms and help prevent others. Even though its not curable, depending on the type of adenocarcinoma (they may need to do more testing, or they may already have done this) there are sometimes some easy to take medications (eg hormone therapy or targetted therapy) that could have activity against certain cancers. This could make her feel better and possibly prolong her life (again only if her adenoca had certain characteristics).

No juicing therapy has been shown to help with cancers like this, and my major concern is saying that it could 'cure' her cancer because unfortunately as you know this is not possible. This kind of claim is a sure sign of a scam. I fear that the false hope takes time from her and from you. Spending time and money away from parts of her family could hamper her quality of life. If this is part of her life philosophy though and not something that will change then maybe it is what will make her happiest. It just won't work.

I take back what I said about my major concern though. Its her spine. If she has a large lesion encroaching on the canal like it sounds like you're saying, then depending on the location she could be at risk for a spinal cord compression. This is an emergency and could result in paralysis, loss of bowel and bladder control, or even losing the ability to breathe depending on where the lesion is.

My wife is, unfortunately, the worst, and comes up zany crap off facebook etc almost daily.  Sorry, I don't put any stock into ALMOST ALL OF IT!

When I hear healing with ""spirituality"" I think of fundamentalist christian parents who intended to ""cure"" their children with prayer (Mathew 9.22 and Act's 3.16 come to mind) instead innocent children that could have been treated, and survived, died. I'm a little biased, i don't believe in god,  But I do kinda like the 'ol flying spaghetti monster.

Andy Kaufman did his all fruit diet treatment, and that wild stuff in the Philippines.

As a 15 year old kid, I watched my father die an agonizing, horribly slow, excruciating death from the same cancer I have.  Palliative care back then was pretty shitty, doctors were afraid he might get addicted to morphine so they chose to limit his pain meds and let him suffer for months instead of his comfort and addiction.  Stupid fucks!

In that same year I consoled my two best friends who both lost a parent to cancer - one his father and the other his mother.  We three watched them die in agony.

A decade and a half later, my step father's cancer, at least he had hospice and they allowed him to die with dignity managing his pain.  Hope that is the way my mother goes in the next year.  Possibly  me in the next two.,

Here's some advice - Do what your oncologist(s) recommend - yes plural - build a team and follow their guidance.  Eat the best food you can afford - avoid processed food, fat and sugar.   Exercise - as much as you can. HAVE A FUCKING AWESOME ATTITUDE (that's my spirituality - I've read all my oncologist reports - that's the recurring theme - they all think I have an awesome attitude). Finally, I found solace - distraction from the pain and nausea in  video games - Fallout 3 and Borderlands!

hingedingedurgen,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cdzc2gr,3,cdzkgk3,"I am sorry but I don't know much but about radiation. I would assume they would rule that out as well since it is a rather aggressive form of cancer treatment like chemo. Hospice can be at your own home or in an actual facility. I believe palliative care would be in an actual facility. Your grandmother's doctor would know a lot more than I do. I actually just got done interning at a cancer organization collecting resource information. Here is everything I have for both palliative and hospice care. At least in America, I believe hospice care is for patients with 6 months or less to live. Palliative care is focused on comfort care like hospice but also provides curative treatment. Make sure to write any questions down and discuss them thoroughly with the doctor. They are specifically there to help you in these type of situations. Don't be afraid to ask them to be as clear as possible when it comes to these things. Death can be difficult to discuss.

Website: http://theconversationproject.org/
Overview: The Conversation Project is dedicated to helping people talk about their wishes for end-of-life care. Too many people are dying in a way they wouldn’t choose, and too many of their loved ones are left feeling bereaved, guilty, and uncertain. It’s time to transform our culture so we shift from not talking about dying to talking about it. It’s time to share the way we want to live at the end of our lives. And it’s time to communicate about the kind of care we want and don’t want for ourselves. We believe that the place for this to begin is at the kitchen table—not in the intensive care unit—with the people we love, before it’s too late. Together we can make these difficult conversations easier. We can make sure that our own wishes and those of our loved ones are expressed and respected.

I definitely think she would qualify for hospice support. They can prescribe you all the palliative meds you need. Morphine can be given in very non invasive drops under the tongue and there are even creams that can help with pain/anxiety. She would probably need something that is long acting (MS Contin) along with a short acting (dilaudid or morphine) for breakthrough pain. I don't know if this would expedite the process, but it will help make you mom feel more comfortable.

nuttychemist,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1tfntb,13,ce7kmzg,"I'm terminal.. I have questioned myself why I continue to do treatments.  it always comes back to quality of life vs quantity of life. I find that right now my treatment helps me live a better life.  even though it sucks! I think the roughest thing is dealing with the various side effects from treatment! (I'm still dealing with side effects from chemo that I took 2 months ago!!!! Trust me I get so angry at times because of why and how it happened. Ultimately I want to live long enough to get a few items checked off my bucket list and have as much time, QUALITY TIME with my fiancé as possible.)

I just finished my last round of radiation on the 6th of December with the hopes of shrinking my tumor.   I know that it's not a cure,  but it helps because its shrunken my tumor, which has helped with my pain some what.

I'm going to share a true story about my dad. Growing up I had no idea that there was anything wrong with him. Maybe it's because my memories are faded or because I was so young, I never knew my dad nearly died multiple times while being operated on for colon cancer in his 30s. I'm sharing this because my story follows his in my own special way. Genetics are a BITCH!  I was diagnosed with the same disorder as my dad at the age of 12, I had my first colonoscopy then and by age 14 I had stage 0 or 1 colon cancer. That's where my story and his differ. 

Sorry,  I didn't mean to ramble!!!, I'll get to the point of this rambling tale. When was teenager, my dad decided that he was tired of all the poking and prodding and decided to stop getting any treatment other than palliative care. He was on hospice for a year before getting kicked out because he wasn't dying fast enough! That was in 1995, he was again given a time frame of 6 months,  he defied the odds just because he loved life and he loved his girls and he probably had a list of things he wanted to see. My dad passed on January 5, 2005 at the age of 53, just 1 week shy of his 54th birthday. 

The moral is you can do what is right for you and still be ok. At the end of the day I'd rather enjoy what time I do have.  If you do choose to stop treatment it doesn't mean your life is going to end right then and there.

Even when it was close to his passing, I remember sitting with him crying because I though he'd croak it shortly after getting put into the hospice house. I'll remember his words til the day I die,  ""Don't worry princess, it's not today. I'm not going today and just remember I'll always love you.""

Sorry for this massive post, but I hope I helped, even just a little. If you need a shoulder I'm here hypothetically in reddit space. Hang in there!",t3_1tfntb,t1_ce7kmzg,2013-12-22 06:30:39,,,,
EgonIsGod,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1udv6s,1,cehg49f,"First, I want to say that I'm so terribly sorry that you and your mother are going through this. I survived my bout, and my mother did hers, but my grandfather was not so lucky. 

When you are diagnosed with cancer, it feels like everything is spiraling out of control. It was bad enough that there weren't enough hours in the day to deal with normal life, but this on top of everything shifts your perspective so that you feel as if you've got to keep working and at the same time wonder why. It's good that she's in no pain. I sincerely hope that it will stay that way, but it would be wise to speak with a palliative care specialist to ensure what time she has left is tolerable if not good. Even if she is in no pain, the cancer will reach to her heart, lungs, brain, or any combination of those things. She should be made aware of what her time left will be like, and even the exact means by which she's likely to die. I don't want to sound morbid, but there is no shame in considering PAS if she wishes to avoid what is to come. 

But, ultimately, these are all her decisions. And control is key. She must be given back control over her life. So instead of trying to second guess her, ask whether or not she wants you around. Ask if she wants to go to a palliative care specialist. Ask if she wants to talk about what will happen next. It should all be in her hands. And as a patient she does not have the means to ensure the rest of her life is in her hands. That's your job. Speak with her. Open up. Track down as much information about palliative care and Hospice that you can. Fill a notebook with questions and talk people's ears off until you're an expert so you can help look out for her. 

I know it hurts. It hurts like hell. But you've got to keep doing like you're doing and put on a brave face. For her. So her time is less burdened with sadness.

One thing that makes me cringe is when people comment that he's better off etc, or that he's in a better place.  Yes, it is a good thing that someone's suffering is over, but someone dealing with a fresh loss is not going to feel blessed that a loved one is gone.

Hey Reddit,


I've been a lurker for quite some time. I've posted a couple of BS items...nothing major. Just more to see how it all works. I’m posting today with something serious though, and any and all help is very much welcome and appreciated.


I’ve got a very good friend whose husband has just been diagnosed with cancer. The guy is 40 years old, and they have a 1 year old daughter together.


I don’t know all the details or all of the medical jargon, but here’s a somewhat basic summary of what’s going on:


- Pain in the stomach started at the beginning of December
- Toward the end of December, the pain was unbearable
- Tests were done and it was determined that there were tumours on the liver and lymph nodes (and, I believe, also on the lungs)
- More tests were done and results were received on January 8th: they’re looking at incurable cancer and palliative care


What I’m asking is, those of you that have had incurable/untreatable, aggressive cancers, how did you survive? I know what palliative care is, but people sometimes pull through these things, right? Stranger things have happened. My friend is trying to stay optimistic, and is open to anything that might help...natural or holistic remedies, probably even god damn healing crystals if there was even the slightest hint of them working.


So Reddit, please tell me, what was the secret to your survival?

*Edit: my friend and her husband have received the official diagnosis; it's stage 4 pancreatic cancer. They're meeting with oncologists this week (the week of January 13th) to see about treatment options.

cheekeemonkee,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1uvpqb,5,cemitjn,"I'm often stunned by doctors' glib responses to our treatment side effects. As others here have suggested, seek another professional opinion. The neuropathy you're describing can be debilitating and opioid painkillers don't tend to make much of a dent. The gabapentins suggested in this thread can help. Complementary therapies such as supplements (B vitamins) and acupuncture may help ease the pain and fight against further nerve damage. 

I presume your chemo is administered by a nurse. You can ask him/her about potential relief options as well. They have lots more front line experience of patients' side effects and may be able to more effectively lobby your doctor on your behalf. 

To a degree, yes, you will have pain or discomfort that you will have to ""suck up"". That said, your health care team should be doing everything possible to palliate symptoms. If you're at a major cancer center there may even be a palliative specialist you can consult. 

Sometimes we have to be our own wingman. I recommend a Google search for the name of your chemo agent and palliative care to see what options are out there. Be fierce in advocating for your right to humane treatment. If you have someone who can help (even if it's the chemo nurse) enlist them to your army.

He developed a persistent cough during october and finally went to the doctor late december. They drained a lot of fluid from his lungs and performed a series of tests. This past tuesday they finally told us the diagnosis and started the carboplatin chemo in 3 week cycles. 

Good news is that he feels and looks great. Solid energy, minimal coughing, and during the check up they found he was no longer leaking any fluids. In addition, the cancer is confined to his right lung. 

A coworker told me he was also diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and all they did was remove the lung, he is still kicking 12 years later. My dad's oncologist suggested palliative care from this point forward but we were not happy with her. She takes weeks to reply and forgot to ask for pt/ct scans and to prescribe him the proper medication.


I understand the statistics of survival but we wan't to try everything. My question is why can't we remove the lung? The doctor replied with a one sentence email ""we can't because it's stage 4"".

First of all, palliative care is NOT (as I also thought it) always an end-stage thing.  It is also about pain management and keeping a person comfortable and having supports in place. 

My Dad had pleural effusion at one point and chemo helped dry that up.  It didn't take away his tumor (his was inoperable), but it made things a lot more comfortable for him and bought him time. He had the Gem-Carbo combo and I think it is one of the more tolerable types.  

I think surgeons are hesitant to do surgery on any cancer that has invaded any nearby tissues/metastasized, which includes the pleural effusion.  But every patient is unique, and so try not to get too caught up in stats.  Even inoperable, some patients can get to NED and/or beat the stats.  ",t3_1vyrrf,t1_cey6xws,2014-01-25 00:51:40,,,Lung Cancer with Malignant Pleural Effusion?,"Howdy, my dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 non small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion and was wondering if anyone had any experience in the area.

He developed a persistent cough during october and finally went to the doctor late december. They drained a lot of fluid from his lungs and performed a series of tests. This past tuesday they finally told us the diagnosis and started the carboplatin chemo in 3 week cycles. 

Good news is that he feels and looks great. Solid energy, minimal coughing, and during the check up they found he was no longer leaking any fluids. In addition, the cancer is confined to his right lung. 

A coworker told me he was also diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and all they did was remove the lung, he is still kicking 12 years later. My dad's oncologist suggested palliative care from this point forward but we were not happy with her. She takes weeks to reply and forgot to ask for pt/ct scans and to prescribe him the proper medication.


I understand the statistics of survival but we wan't to try everything. My question is why can't we remove the lung? The doctor replied with a one sentence email ""we can't because it's stage 4"". We were also planning to head to MD Anderson after the second chemo treatment to see our options after we see how he's doing."

Now what?,"My dad got diagnosed last summer with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. I think it's specifically large cell type but not sure because i've only seen the results in greek. His first round of chemo lasted until about November and included Avastin, not sure what else. That worked on the lung tumour, which thankfully got smaller, but did not stop the cancer metastasising to the liver.

After that they changed his chemo to something that included Taxotere, which he did 3 times in the space of the last couple months. 

Last week's exams brought pretty bad news showing that the liver tumour is growing and there are metastases in various places including lymph nodes and pancreas. We've not spoken with the oncologist yet, these are just the scan results.

What can we do now is my question? Am I right in thinking that he has gone through first and second line chemo in quick succession and not responded? Is there another drug that he can try? Is there a next step?

I've looked at clinical trials but I'm not sure what to look for. My dad is in Greece so I imagine the options are not huge. I am also looking to get his exams translated and send them to Sloan Kettering for their virtual consultation. Not sure what to expect but its worth a try.

I know things are not looking good but surely there must be something else out there.

That is a B cell lymphoma of the spleen (white cells of the spleen) that usually has an enlarged spleen (we call that splenomegaly) and is usually found in the bone marrow also at diagnosis. It is sometimes in the circulating blood and rarely in the lymph nodes. 

This is considered an indolent non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Indolent NHL types have a relatively good prognosis with a median survival as long as 10 to 20 years, but they usually are not curable in advanced clinical stages. Early-stage (stage I and stage II) indolent NHL can be effectively treated with radiation therapy alone. Most of the indolent types are nodular (or follicular) in morphology.

If it is wide-spread it can be treated with chemotherapy. Splenectomy was the old standard of treatment but is becoming more of a palliative treatment for cases in which chemo doesn't work.

My parents live overseas so they are difficult to contact and my dad is the type to keep things to himself so he doesn't worry people but I am kind of losing it over not having any answers. So far all I know is the name (see above) and that they are taking the ""watching and waiting"" approach. Can someone please explain to me why this is even a thing? The whole ""let's wait until it gets worse before it gets better"" thing makes no sense to me. My Dad means the world to me and his diagnosis has really rocked my entire life, so sitting here waiting is making me crazy.

Really need some tips. Even just ice chips he's having a hard time with.

He has stage 4 testicular cancer that is real aggressive. Brain, neck, liver, spine, lung, testical, hip joints. All cancer.

He completed chemo about six months ago, but they didn't get it all. He kept us in the dark about this. He didn't have insurance and I guess he figured he would wait for ACA so he could get insurance and get into a better hospital. Cancer really spread during is time. It's really scary right now. 

He had radiation on his neck. This made him really sick and he started having trouble eating much. He just completed his first round of chemo and he isn't eating anything at all. They have him hooked up to the bags to get nutrients into him, but I guess these don't really replace the benefits of actual food?

We've got to start getting food into him as soon as possible to prepare for the next round of chemo (in 2 weeks or so), but the way he's been it's just like he can't hold down anything. His last day of chemo was horrible, he said. Like, he doesn't even remember a 12-hour block of time, and he was hallucinating. I think it really spooked him, understandably. I think he's really worried about these next rounds because as he gets weaker it's just going to get harder.

I'm afraid that if we can't get good nutrients into him that he might not be able to complete the chemo."
The_Gage,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_1zcf6r,6,cfsjjgq,"I've only met a handful of patients who developed metastasis within the spinal fluid due to leukemia.  In my limited experience, it can result in increased spinal fluid pressure leading to headaches, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.  I've seen it treated with both radiation at localized lesions such as a brain tumor next to the ventricles within the brain, as well as with chemotherapy within the spinal fluid, or intrathecal chemotherapy.

I think the most difficult symptom for families is the confusion and memory loss that often coincides with spread of the malignancy.  In my limited experience, it often comes on slowly and patients learn to cover or compensate for their confusion.  It doesn't become more noticeable until they're put in unfamiliar situations such as the hospital.  

I don't think I have any advice that would be helpful, other than continue to talk with your husband's oncologist and take advantage of all care including hospice/palliative care, respite care, and home healthcare when appropriate.  Without knowing your husband's current state I can't say what would be best for him, but I'd recommend you research all current and future options.

They use the folic acid because it makes one of the other drugs more toxic to the cancer cells. They also gave him Benadryl, to avoid reactions, and prednisone (I forget why) and an anti-nausea drug. Then they measured his blood levels of various things; he often needed supplemental magnesium. And if his white blood count was down (indicating a compromised immune system), they gave him a shot of Neulasta, which acted to restore it (this is a relatively new invention). 

So that was all the chemo, and the things they did to make it work better, and kill the cancer cells while keeping him alive. They did not do radiation, as all visible cancer had been removed during surgery (he had two rather extensive surgeries before the chemo). Then he just tried to eat as well as he could (he also has celiac disease, which complicates his diet), and got a little exercise walking the dog.

By the way, although my husband is now fine, our friend did not make it; in his case the radiation was palliative (to reduce pain from metastases to his bones, which is how his cancer was discovered).

sionnach,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cgahh3y,1,cgahoi0,"&gt; quite often patients regret choosing conventional treatment.

I agree with that. Sometimes it's inevitable that patients are going to die and they put themselves through more than they should. Some patients should consider palliative care sooner. However, there are many suitable conventional palliative treatments available which do a wonderful job - much better than alternatives to therapy. If you're going to die, just make it as comfortable as possible for as long as its worth it. 

&gt; Clearly there are believable reports of people curing their cancer by taking matters into there own hands.

Really? There are plenty of anecdotes, but none backed up by proper trials as far as I am aware. Any ""natural"" remedies that exist have been medicalised into, you know, medicine. 

Sometimes somebody chooses to eat cannabis oil and their cancer retreats. Maybe it would have retreated anyway. If I hop on one foot, and my cancer does better this month (it fluctuates) should I declare hopping a cure all for cancer?

Anyway, I am done debating this. Please just consider that the next time you urge someone to forego conventional medicine in  favour of an alternative to therapy you are playing a part in killing them. You may not feel that you are doing that, but you are and you will have blood on your hands. ",t3_214jo5,t1_cgahoi0,2014-03-24 11:59:11,,,,

BadGuyAnusProtector,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cgnzqbr,1,cgo3cn1,"Thanks for the input. Unfortunately, I was like you after surgery. Found out it had spread during post op recovery and that now I was terminal, irresectable, and that I would be receiving palliative chemotherapy. I too was a walking dead man and had made my peace with it. Then all of this started happening. They started by testing me and finding out whether I was HER2+. Turned out I was. Suddenly I wasn't a dead man walking anymore and didn't quite know how to handle it. I was prepared to die, I was prepared for treatment and tests to try and give me the most time possible. Now I am staring at a blank slate and I don't know which is more frightening the fact that I was prepared to die or now not knowing what is happening. Definites are always easier to deal with that the random unknown. I am going to do the tests and I am going to be the guinea pig. My wife and I discussed it last night. I am physically healthier and stronger than any of the other patients under the care of my doctors. I might as well give them a chance to hopefully find something useful out from me.

Reading your post made me realize something. We(cancer patients) aren't the walking dead. We may not have much time be we are more full of life than anyone I know. Though we have to make the hard decisions and suffer this fight with our body, most of us tend to make the most out of life. Every breath, every experience, every word spoken has more meaning for us than for many others in the world. We are more useful to humanity than you realize. We are the bright spots who remind people to cherish the time they have, we are the reminders that maybe, just maybe their lives aren't that bad.

There is no point in facing death if we can't laugh in its face and scream catch me if you can. Keep up the good fight and make death work for it.

rageagainsthevagene,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_23btt1,5,cgvl1ku,"yes yes, definitely stay away from the googles. It will only make you more upset. 

First, I disagree a little with the others. But I think it depends on your existing relationship. Are you close? Like besties? Is she more authoritative and distant? I think moving forward, if you're not there, having a close relationship requires honesty. I say, be open and honest with her with your feelings. Chances are if you're feeling scared or nervous or anxious or even mad -- she's feeling it too and you can both talk about how cancer makes you feel. You may even feel a little less alone by the end, each realizing you're not alone. Become good friends, talk to her like you would your bestie. Sometimes she might just want to sit and talk, maybe even about something other than cancer. Ask her to tell you some funny stories about when you were little. Tell her some memories that you remember (she might not even realize you remembered those things). I didn't get super close with my mom until I came home from college, when I realized that she is just a human being and doing absolutely the best she can. It was too easy for me in high school to lose our relationship in my own selfishness. You may not have the luxury of taking your sweet time to come to the realization that no one in this world loves you as much as your mother does. The sooner you realize that, the easier it will be to transform your relationship from mother/daughter into the best of friends. I think honesty is the best policy, if you have questions about her treatments or medicines, ask her. Ask her if she wants someone to come sit with her while she does her chemo or waits in the waiting room for another doc appointment. Sometimes just being there means the world.

What kind of cancer is it and what stage is she? I don't want to give you all kind of palliative advice when what you really need is hope. It is a HUGE difference. Without knowing, my best advice is to live each and every day like it might be your last day together. Skip hanging out with your friends or going to the movies and just hang out with your mom. If she's mobile, take her on a mother daughter date. Tell her you just want to spend time with her. Even if it's just sitting on the couch watching tv together. In 20 years you won't even remember your friends names and while hanging out at the mall may seem important now, you'll look back and be so happy you have those memories with your mom instead.

plarpco,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_23s1r0,1,ch00wal,"I'm sorry to hear about your mom, and the struggle that you find yourself in. First off, I think you should check out [pancan.org](http://www.pancan.org) and give their PALS (Patient And Liaison Services) program a call (877-272-6226). They have trained volunteers that can help you, by sending information, discussing treatment options, and they might be able to give you some insight into patients like your mom who don't want to fight. 

While you're on the website, read some of the survivor stories, and maybe think about sharing some of them with your mom. I don't know if it will help, but it's worth a try. There are people who beat the odds and live a lot longer after fighting, although it is not easy.

Pancreatic cancer is not something that can be cured, so a lot of the treatment is considered palliative (to reduce suffering). So, weather or not your mom wants to fight, there are things that doctors can do to ease any pain or symptoms she's having.  

Another option is to seek out a clinical trial. Pancan.org can help you find something in your area. Her participation in a clinical trial could help other pancan suffers in the future. Do you think that might convince her to change her mind?

My dad was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, and had one round of chemo treatments and is now in partial remission. Unfortunately, after one year, his oncologist just suggested another PET scan after his blood-work indicated some problems with his liver. We're waiting on the results. From my experience, the fight is hard, the chemo is usually aggressive, and the outcomes are not ideal.

Good luck to you and your mom.

applebananacherry,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_23txf2,2,ch2etrh,"Advice point numero uno: get her to a hospice program. They'll provide palliative care to keep her comfortable. They'll also provide social workers, counseling, and great resources for the rest of the family. This situation sucks, and it unfortunately is not going to get easier.

On a personal level, you should know that when people start to decline they can often be extremely difficult to deal with. Liver tumors mess with people mentally, because the liver is what filters toxins out of the blood. When that stops working normally, the brain can be affected. So please keep that in mind if you find yourself baffled by any odd situations.

Aside from that, there is a lot that you can do now to make things simpler later. If your mother is not married, then you could discuss with her who will have financial power of attorney. There will probably be a point when she is too sick to pay bills, question bank charges, etc, and this will be simpler with a financial POA. You should also fill out a healthcare POA if she doesn't have one already. Even if all she wants is to pass peacefully, she will need someone to enforce that position if she's not able to speak for herself.

As morbid as it is, I would suggest considering making funeral arrangements now. It's a hard task. I didn't finish and had to finalize arrangements after my mom died. It would have been much easier on me if I had finished that sooner. 
Please consider making these arrangements now, when you can think clearly and are able to do things like comparison shop and set up a payment plan. Hospice staff will recommend funeral homes that they have found to be reputable. You don't want to have to scramble, or get ripped off, or conversely have to settle for something less than what you want because the money isn't available. You should bring a friend with you who can be emotionally supportive for you, but also objective about what is going on. 

From here on out, your mom may need some help around the house. You should decide how much you want to do and stick with that, no matter what. It is extremely common for people to burn themselves out caring for another. What usually happens is that they end up sick, and then 2 people need caregivers. If you can do 1 day a week, then do 1 day a week, and find 6 friends, cousins, whoever to fill in the rest. If you can't do that, then I would strongly suggest looking into in-home care, an assisted living facility, or a nursing home, depending on your family's wants and budget. If there's no money available, then there should be government funding via medicaid to help with the cost. This will be much easier to handle if someone is appointed financial POA.

You should also ask your mother whether she wants a living will or DNR form filled out. Be sure to keep copies of these handy. For some reason, paramedics never give the darn things back, so make sure that you've got several.

You may want to arrange counseling for yourself through hospice or a private therapist. It will prove really valuable. Most hospice programs offer free or low-cost counseling, and can point you to support groups that might interest you. 

One final thing. I am personally a very curious person and tend to google things. I would suggest that you not do that. Seriously. The best person to ask about your mother's condition would be someone involved with her medical care. The internet will give you as much clinical detail as you want. Trust me, when it's your mother, you don't want the unvarnished clinical view. I'd suggest chatting with her nurse.",t3_23txf2,t1_ch2etrh,2014-04-26 06:23:19,,,What should I expect for a mother who has terminal metastatic colon cancer?,"Okay I'm new here. My mother has terminal metastatic colon cancer. I am not sure of the stages but from memory it is 4d - either way it is the most serious one. The cancer has spread to the liver, lungs, big tumours in the chest wall. We've known about it for a year or so but she is only just starting to get symptoms. Basically I am wondering if anyone else has been through this or supported someone through this because I really have no idea what to expect. Her symptoms are not extreme yet but they have come on very quickly. She is very tired now, and has a couple of 'naps' - just lying in bed resting - a day. Also she is eating less and less, and gets pain in her stomach where the tumours are. She has stopped nearly all activities like cooking and cleaning, and doesn't like to go out or see people at all. Just a month ago you wouldn't have guessed she was sick.

I know that this cancer will kill her and I accept that. She has tried chemo but the cancer was too strong. The first oncologist we saw said that for many patients, they maintained good health for a long period of time before a quick decline; and for other patients it was a gradual decline.

I don't know about where you're at, but here in the US, the 5 year survival rate for what we've got is somewhere between 6 and 10%, depending on what source you use.

The kidney was removed and all was well. A few years later she was diagnosed with cancer in her womb, which again was removed. Last year her brother (my uncle) was diagnosed with primary cancer of the colon and metastasis in the liver. He died 5 months after it was found (allthough he had walked around with complaints for some time).

Around this time they found blood in my mothers stool sample which is a mandatory health check every half year in the country that she lives. They performed a colonoscopy and found a tumor in the colon. They removed half a meter of colon with tumor and inspected glands and colon for signs of cancer spreading. Nothing was found. They stated they found it on time and no chemotherapy was necessary.

Fast forward half a year, february this year she had her full medical examn checking for cancer. Nothing was found in liver, lungs, pancreas etc. Her blood values (proteine markers, etc) were good.

In march she complained about pains under her right shoulder blade, painfull stomach after eating and overall tiredness. They did a lot scans (xray &amp; ultrasonic i think) and also a urine sample. What they found was an infection of the urine tract, bladder and signs of infection of the liver. They put her on 2 weeks of antibiotics, which caught on. Then sent her home saying all was fine and not worries to be had about cancer. That weekend she couldn't sleep because of pain or eat at all. My parents demanded she be hospitalized and again a full examn be done. After 1 day of tests and scans they found tumors in the liver that apparently weren't visible on scan 2-3 weeks earlier and her proteine values were 65 instead of 5 three months earlier. (apparently indicating massive tumor growth?).

My understanding is that metastasis in the liver is incurable and that she will not die an old woman in warm in her bed.

My understanding is also that only 1 out of 10 people with this secondary cancer can receive surgery.

And my understanding is also that if no surgery and only chemotherapy is administered life expectancy is a few months.

Finally, i am broken, devastated, numb and the feeling of her disappearing and never seeing or speaking to her again is surreal and everytime the thought passes my mind my stomach turns around..

Any comments, advice is welcome, thanks for reading....

**UPDATE 14-5-2014:** this morning we were told that she is not operable because of multiple small tumors spread out over the liver, I guess that's the first bit of hope we had that is lost...
Im guessing she will get chemotherapy to try and stop the growth of cancer, they mentioned something about placing a small plug in her armpit for the chemotherapy and receiving steroids (im guessing the steroids are meant to keep the body from rejecting the plug?)

Her brother also received chemo and it didn't work (small recline in tumors first and then rampant growth after).

Im totally lost and I can't imagine what my mother (or anyone in her situation must be going through)."

My treatment is palliative only, there's no cure so no point in hardcore chemo. I did a gemcitabine/carboplatin regime, it was gentle and didn't really compromise my wellbeing, it did clear the lymph tumours and a few of the liver tumors, so it gave me some breathing space. There is potentially a microwave ablation trial in my future.

Right now I'm getting stuff done that I always wanted to do in the time I have left. I find the time pressure I'm under now makes prioritising the things I want to spend my time on very much clearer. Today I went searching to buy land, I've always wanted to move off grid, basically it's now or never. I found the most beautiful rainforest block today, it has a waterfall on it. A lot of stuff I dreamed of will never be, but so it is for everyone. I wish there was a god and an after life, but I find the idea a bit far fetched, so this is all there is.

Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night

Do not go gentle into that good night,

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,

Because their words had forked no lightning they

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Do not go gentle into that good night.

.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on that sad height,

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

On the way home, you are chased into a dark alley by a cackling gang with knives. Blood pounding in your veins, they force you down, tie you up onto a chair, and use you for boxing practice, as their leader calmly explains, in great detail, how he’s going to brutally torture you, rape you as you bleed and cry, remove your organs and skin you alive, before enacting every claim to the letter. 
That’s cancer. That’s cancer treatment. Exacting. Methodical. Relentless. Inhuman. The full knowledge of what is about to befall you makes your blood chill and boil in tandem, filling your heart with fear against such a monstrous foe, a fear that fuels its enjoyment of its’ sadism ever more intently. It grips your soul and squeezes till the light either slowly leaves your lonely eyes for a glassy vacancy, or is replaced with an obedient masochism, a feeling of safety from within your skin coffin, the demons holding court as your spirit is dissected and compacted into nothing, and only the quiet, whimpering desire for a quick termination lingers underneath the socialized Jimmy Carter smile. My own dailliances with this fearsome enemy have taught me a ruthlessness of my own. It emerges from the black, mutating at will, whipping out to sting my family, my loved ones, rendering them hopeless against my futile hissing, my sibilant rage, the barbed attacks protecting the limping wheezing impact crater within.
This is not something a person ‘survives’ in the traditional sense. You cast your bets, roll the dice, hold on to your ankles, and pray that God doesn’t screw you any harder. It exists in 200 different aberrant forms, each with individual mutations, and it can hide for years on end only to re-emerge when you least suspect it. It’s in your blood now.
But it doesn’t stop. The ghost of cancer will coil around your soul. I feel like I'm the last person alive, guarding the last bottle of water in the world, in a burnt out house, trapped in a corner, it’s freezing cold, the lights are flickering on and off, and people who want me dead are coming up the stairs. Always leaning a little towards ready to die, and seeing the demons lurk in everybody’s eyes….denial, cowardice, justifying selfishness. endless numbers more - and thanks for asking.
And what then, of the fallout, years down the line? Chronic exhaustion, loss of appetite, sleeping through the day, wanting to cry to release the grief but you’ve repressed it too deeply, loneliness no matter who’s in the room, alienation from lack of community or real humanity, desire to hurt the stupid self absorbed ones to make that alienation easier to handle, dealing with every day being exactly the fucking same, chasing cause and effect in pointless struggle, seeing the insanity of the level of corruption in the system, having no will or money to escape except through drugs, no desire to enter back into a world of hopelessly brutal zero-sum competition, no will to feel, to achieve, to breathe, knowing that if you survive you’ll still lose everything? Feeling rejected and despised from being an unwilling scapegoat for everyone else’s silent wounds?!

How would you handle it? You don’t, you all run away like the cowards you truly are. You all need a shot of humanity straight into your goddamn eyeballs! You think you know cancer, with your lip service, big proclaimed pharmaceutical trials, your Race For Life, pink ribbons, Lifetime documentaries, cheese and wine fundraising parties, your bleating for a cure?

Fuck you AND your pity party. You don’t know shit.

With every creak of a floorboard, the end is coming.

Now excuse me, I need to light a J.

In November of 12 they put in Amaya resivor in his skull to pull out fluid and put in chemo. After 4 sessions, they couldn't detect any cells in his brain fluid. In October they told him he had 2 months. I remember when they told him that, he called me and cried, I cried. We agreed to do the best with what was left. I was with him almost daily. Every month a new complication. He stopped chemo in February 2013, it took too much out of him. June brough the cancer in the brain back. He couldn't hear and was disoriented. We decided raidiation could help him feel better. It shrank the cancer in his head enough that his hearing came back. Father's Day 13, I got him tickets to nascar in Michigan. My mom took him, he loved it. It was a bucket list item. 

August 13 was the last time my dad lived at home with my mom. He had a brain bleed and needed rehab. A nursing home was helpful, I was there too. His mind and grace were there, but his strength was dying. More complications and hospital stays. November came and he stayed the same. One morning he had a seizure and called me at work as they took him to the hospital. He said to come, and not wait till after work. I beat him there.

His eyes were yellow, his liver was failing, the cancer had it too. Before my mom got there he said ""I'm not going back to that nursing home, I wanted you to be here"". I knew what he meant. I promised that I would take care of mom, and that I would keep living after he left. Mom came back and we had a day together, in the ER mind you. But we laughed. He told me how proud of me he was, and loved me. And he was sorry for all the illness had put me through. I said it was ok, and I wouldn't trade the time with him for anything.

My mom was diagnosed at stage 4, went through all the treatment options available, and really wore herself down.

Get her a hospital bed in your home or her home, wherever she is living. It seems really daunting, but my mom told us it was very relieving and comforting to be able to control the bed and it helped her keep strength up to reposition herself as needed where she wasn't able to in her regular bed. The caregivers are seriously some of the most amazing people you will ever meet, and the sooner you get them on board, the better care they can offer to your mom as they get to know her preferences and personality.  They provide a range of services and are truly very very helpful at a time where you as a caregiver and she as a patient really do need the help. As a caregiver I had access to professionals that I could chat with, vent to, and cry in front of when I couldn't hold it together in front of my mom. They helped us with filing paperwork for social security and disability benefits. They were wonderful and many hospices offer all of their services whether your insurance covers it or not, regardless of your ability to pay which really takes some stress off of your family.

While that is standard care for very advanced cervical cancer, if I were you I would, at a minimum, be reaching out to other doctors for a 2nd and even a 3rd opinion. I am technically stage 4b, and have been doing chemo for 8 or 9 months.

plarpco,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2abqlf,2,citiwa4,"Has your dad even started chemo yet?

Pancreatic cancer affects the pancreas and often the ducts leading to the intestines. The pancreas secretes enzymes into the intestines to help digest food, primarily fat and protein. It's possible that your dad's digestive processes are being affected by the pancreatic cancer.

My dad's pancreatic cancer manifested itself with horrible abdominal pains. The treatment is palliative, meaning it is primarily intended to reduce pain and suffering. The chemo will shrink the tumors and restore pancreatic function, thereby reducing pain and helping digestive problems. After the first 5 treatments last year, my dad was in great health for 10 months, all of his pain was gone. In his case, it was the cancer that was causing all of his abdominal pains. His cancer and stomach pains did return though, so he's on round 2 of chemo.

Of course, the treatment itself is horrible and caused lots of digestive problems of its own. My dad reacts poorly to Folfirinox and unless he eats a strict [BRAT diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAT_diet), he has extreme diarrhea most of the time during treatment. He hates the diet, and so he cheats and will have a milk shake or something else really fatty and sweet, and then he pays the price for it for the next 12 hours.

If your dad starts on chemo, the symptoms will hopefully get better, although it is a struggle to get there. I would speak to his oncologist to make sure there isn't something else going on, but these could be normal symptoms for his cancer.

Good luck to you and your dad. Check out [pancan.org](http://www.pancan.org) (give their PALS team a call) and check out the survivor stories.",t3_2abqlf,t1_citiwa4,2014-07-10 14:49:18,,,"Dad diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

When I went through this sort of thing (stage IV colon, adenocarcinoma actually, hah) I was practically begging to get as much chemo as I could handle after the surgery that removed the last of the tumor. The surgeons do their best to get rid of every bit of cancer tissue they can see, but there can still be tiny trace amounts of the stuff left over that, if left untreated, can just grow back into a big, deadly tumor again. When I started my battle I was given a death sentence by my doctors (palliative care only). It was through **many** sessions of chemo and three brutal surgeries that I overcame that fate - I was certainly NOT going to take any chances with the cancer coming back that I suffered so much to be rid of. And I write this today 3 years cancer-free, having not bought into a **single** dietary/serum/supplement/alternative medicine fad that's getting people killed. Now, I think it's okay if you want to try those methods but *only if you think of them as a supplement to modern/western medicine, and not a replacement for it.*

MissKatz1, I beg you not to take a few months of remission as proof, ""spread the word,"" and potentially kill someone with bad advice. Wait 5 years, and if you're still around, you can tell people about the methods you use, but be sure not to leave out the surgery that saved your life ;)

Adderall make you feel kind of weird, IMO. It's kind of speed-y. Some people in my support group do take adderall though, so it can be useful for cancer related fatigue.

skrammmm,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cjdtopx,3,cjduqkp,"Thanks for taking the time to reply.

I am actually well versed in grief- I found my partner's body when I was 4 months pregnant after he took his own life. Then I lost my brother to his murderous wife and so-called best friend while my premmie daughter struggled to get big enough to come home with me. I was homeless by that stage and living in emergency accommodation too.

So yeah, I know what grief is like.

I'm glad you have faith in your life, but I don't. So to me my mother, my partner, my brother are all gone- dead. Finished. And for what? Nothing.

I have very few ""awesome"" memories of my mother because she was a shitty mum. So her death also robbed us of the chance to heal our relationship too. 

So not only did I watch her die a god awful, protracted and preventable death, her stupid, ignorant and selfish choices about refusing treatment robbed us of any good time before her death saying goodbye and making our peace because she refused to admit she was dying- even when she was in palliative care a week before she died! 

And she robbed us of the chance to have any sort of future half way decent mother/daughter relationship too.

Find out as soon as you can what her wishes are for end-of-life care; it's likely not an immediate issue, but it will come up. I have nothing but good things to say about palliative and hospice care, in-home if it is feasible.

Also look into what services are available at local and higher levels of government for in-home care prior to hospice. There are nurses and aides who can help with small problems before they become big ones, and assist with mobility and daily activities. It also takes the burden of being the caregiver off of your family's shoulders, allowing you to simply be family when you spend your time with her.

Ask her physician about how they approach pain management. Don't be afraid to ask around to learn others' approaches. It is important that they be flexible and responsive to sudden changes in her status. 

And, even though it is scary, you need a realistic assessment of her condition, how the disease is likely to progress and what she (and you) will experience along the way. The doctor, and any visiting nurse need to be very honest.

I know lung cancer can't be cured, but there should at least be a chance of mitigation. We're supposed to get more info in two weeks. I wish they hadn't spent so much time thinking the mucus was because she ate too much dairy and other dumb shit like that. For months they just gave her antibiotics thinking it'd pass. I wish they'd taken her illness more seriously and done a biopsy sooner. And now that they know what it is, two weeks just get to more information feels like too long. But I know she's not the only cancer patient waiting in line, and we're lucky enough to live somewhere with governmental medicare, so we just gotta hang in there.

But it's not her death that scares me now; it's the thought of her suffering on her way there. The slow but steady decay.

Ironically, I feel the loneliest when I'm with my family. They're all freaking out and it's hard for me to bear. My dad's been a hard ass all his life but he's now suddenly softened up and constantly keeping her company, and saying things like 'What is our family going to come to?' It just bothers me. I'm not worried about our family's fate or anything like that. I just don't want my mom to suffer. If anything death will be respite after the hard life she's led. My mom's never been healthy; she's got tinnitus, zona and diabetes, among other things.

Just needed to vent. Thanks.

klally6,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cjh97zy,1,cjio2jc,Thanks for the advice. Home palliative care is available when needed but he still feels like he doesn't want it yet. He's only 56 so I understand that he wants to maintain as much independence as possible right until the end. The morphine he's taking along with numerous other painkillers allows him to have control on the pain which is good. He feels in control of his own life still. ,t3_2cmrro,t1_cjio2jc,2014-08-06 17:30:07,,,,

Depending on the spread and severity, your dad may still be able to receive palliative care.  

Now on to some possible hope.  Your dad has a form of metastatic renal cancer, like my dad.  He may be a candidate for the same or a similar immuno-therapy clinical trial, just like my dad.  There's been a lot of promise in these trials when it comes to cancers ""below the belt,"" and your family should seriously consider it.  So hit google up and search for anti PD-L1 clinical trials near you.

The story of his cancer: 

He has a sleeping disorder. So he's just always been tired. Last october he got this cough and he couldn't get rid of it. He got some cough medicine from the doctor. 4 months ago he got really bad stomach aches, and the doctor said it was because of his cough medicines. But that wasn't it. The doctor just let it be. 

Then he started peeing blood, less than a month ago. Again, he went to the doctor, who said it was probably just a vein that popped. His pee was clear again, but my stepdad just insisted he got tested, seeing the amount of cancer in his family. So he got tested, and the day after he was told he had stage 4 kidney cancer, that has grown to his back muscle and spread to his lymph nodes and longue, and it's too late.

They can't do anything. He has less than a year. And I just don't know what to do. He's so okay about all of this, the only thing is that he has small kids, and my mom. And me, I guess, but I'm a bit older than his kids.

I just don't know what to do. Can I do anything? Or should I just go say Hi every day and make jokes with him? What should I feel? I don't know what I feel. It just all feels so terrible, the feeling when we're joking around, that in a year he won't be here to do this. Maybe in just a few months.

I think the first question for you to ask your step dad's oncologist, is what do they mean by palliative. Do they mean, he is too sick to get medications to treat the kidney cancer so they only plan on treating the symptoms or do they meantime the kidney cancer has spread, so it is no longer a curable disease, but it is still treatable to slow down the disease. Oncologists use the term palliative in both scenarios. 

As mentioned earlier an anti-PD1 clinical trial would be a reasonable thing to look into. Otherwise a VEGF targeted therapy would be your next option. Typically about 2/3 of patients will benefit from VEGF targeted therapy.

My boyfriend of 20+ years has been fighting neck and throat cancer since early 2012. First it was just throat cancer and with radiation and erbitux it seemed to go away. 
Then about 8 months later he started having severe neck pains and episodes where he was almost comatose. Doctors at the ER said it was most likely the result of his pain meds. I insisted on having his oncologist retest for cancer. That's when we learned he had neck cancer that spread to his lymph node. So he had currently been on Erbitux and another chemo for 6 months.
Today we were told all of his doctors have decided to end treatment and put him on hospice care. He is in a motor wheelchair due to other problems and has developed stage 3/4 wounds on his hips and feet. The hip again has osteomyelitis but it isn't going to get treated this time. 

He and I are scared and very shocked at this since he was last told the tumors weren't growing with the palliative chemo he had been getting. Now it's like they are saying ""we give up nothing more we can do"". 

I just needed to get my feelings out. He is 58 yrs and I am 69 and I am his sole caretaker. I never thought the end of our relationship would be like this.

bisselse,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2eqi6p,8,ck21hu7,"Palliative care refers to the idea of treating symptoms rather than actively attempting to cure the patient. The goal now for you mother is making her as comfortable as possible for the time that she has left. Hospice is a type of palliative care, but specifically for at-home treatment (they're basically the same thing).

They will help your family sort out questions about her DNR, desire for pain meds vs no pain meds, conditions she would like to have in her room during this time (music, spiritual/religious leaders, visitors, etc). They will also ask how invasive she would like to get in keeping her alive (breathing/feeding tubes, further action to prevent fluid build up).

You're in a really tough situation and there's no ""right"" answer. Before you make any decisions you should speak directly to your mother's doctor (if possible) and get as many facts as are available. Your parents are probably too emotionally charged to sort fact from hope, so going directly to the doctor might be better. What is his best guess as to how long your mother has left? How might that change based on actions they take?

That was mostly fact, now for my opinion. Your mom probably doesn't have much time left. How much time depends on a lot of things and may or may not be known. In a situation with such finality I believe the right question is ""what choice will I regret the least when I think back on this later?"" When you think over that question you might find yourself with a clearer answer of what to do.

Blockhouse,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2eqi6p,3,ck2k8da,"Calling a palliative care consult is not necessarily a sign that the end is nearing.  It's rather that the oncology team knows that maybe they're being a bit aggressive, and they want to make sure that your mother's wishes are being respected.  Oncologists, in general, tend to want to push their patients, and many patients aren't comfortable expressing to their oncologists that the recommended therapy is not consistent with their values.  Pain, nausea, depression, loss of appetite, and other complaints can sometimes be subordinated to the central overriding question of how to treat the cancer.  So the palliative care team offers another unbiased view to help make sure that the patient is comfortable and in agreement with what's planned.

In my institution, we get palliative care involved early in a patient's case.  The earlier the patient gets involved with them, the easier things go.  That way the patients is more oriented to their role and better able to express their wishes in advance.  It's better to have a plan for what to do when things get rocky soon after diagnosis, rather than thrashing around for a plan when things do get rocky.

Some people worry that palliative care physicians are the ghouls of the hospital, but most of them are some of the sweetest, gentlest people I've ever met.  They really do put the patient first.  In fact, I prefer not to think of them as ""palliative care teams.""  I prefer to think of them as ""quality of life teams.""

So don't panic.  Give it a day or two, let palliative care see her, then ask your step-father for an updated prognosis and what the disposition is.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/2dz7k3/father_diagnosed_with_livercolon_cancer/) is my last post. Thank you to everyone for your kind words and thoughts, you really helped me to clear my head.

My father FINALLY received his biopsy results last night. The primary site of his cancer is a sarcoma behind his sacrum. The sarcoma has spread to his liver, colon, lungs, and stomach. We still do not know what type of sarcoma (whether it is soft-tissue or bony-tissue) because his doctors sent the sample off to Emory for a final review since this is such a rare type of cancer. We should receive the final pathology report within the next few days. Based on the information we have now, his doctor has indicated that the cancer is not curable and that without treatment, my father has less than a year left of life. 

Unfortunately, my father is not a candidate for surgery since the cancer has spread so far. At this point, his doctor would like for him to consider both chemo and radiation for palliative care only. He has begun to feel very tired, and has been feeling pain when he sits down. He has an appointment with a medical oncologist next week, but is considering refusing treatment since it would really only be prolonging the inevitable. I have very mixed feelings about this. Obviously I love my dad and want as much time with him as I can possibly get, but I also understand that he does not want to spend the next year feeling like poop and spending all of my parents' money on treatments and specialists that can't do much. 

I will be going home for four days next week to be with my family. In my last post, I indicated that my parents did not want me to come home (I live in Boston, they live in South Carolina) until he started feeling very ill. But I decided that I want to see him while he is still feeling a bit like himself. I just wanted to say thank you for everyone who helped to point me in this direction. Obviously this is a lot to take in at one time, but your kind thoughts and words and prayers really mean a lot to me. "

I don't know your dad. Is he the sort to give up without a good reason?
Because I guess it is up to him. All you can do is tell him you love him and you don't want to loose him.
But it might help to ask a few qualified people to review his case and find out if the chemo is really going to improve his quality of life.
My father died very soon after his first dose of chemo. His specialist wanted to move him to a private hospital and keep going. But we got a second opinion and found out he was dying. Chemo would not have improved his quality of life.
I don't know what stage your dad is at, but he has the right to refuse treatment.
If you think he is of sound mind, and has all the available information, I think you need to let him control his own treatment, he probably has very little control over anything else at this stage.
Palliative care is the next stage, where they focus on his comfort and wellbeing. If that is what he wants, respect his wishes and focus on quality time together.

ahhh_ennui,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2j2vrk,3,cl7x86f,"My mother went on Hospice when she was still healthy enough to travel and live pretty independently. Her cancer was terminal, and chemo was adding worthless pain and suffering rather than providing any real remission, so Hospice made sense. It's no longer reserved for the very end of life as it used to be, but it really depends upon your FIL's diagnosis/prognosis. 

First thing that needs to happen is to talk to your FIL's doctor. S/He'll need to sign over care to Hospice, and it's best to start the discussion with her/him. Call your local Hospice peeps to get a nurse to come and talk to you all for a consultation.

Should everyone agree on Hospice at that point, this is my experience:

The first couple weeks on Hospice will be a flurry of strangers who need to meet your FIL and his at-home caregivers (we had an intake nurse, a social worker, and her regular nurse. Sometimes doctors are also an active role, but often times they are not - depends upon the demands and number of doctors in your network).

During this time, they tell you exactly what to expect from them. They are going to be able to answer any questions you have, although if he's doing relatively well, they won't be able to give you a clear prognosis. They will tell you time frames in terms of ""months/weeks/days/hours"", and will use their expertise to guide you to changes, and what you can expect. They won't sugarcoat anything - they understand and accept how dying works, which is why they are an amazing organization to turn to at this time. You might find yourself arguing with them, and that's OK. I did - sometimes it was me in a daughter denial, but I had some legitimate points, too. Your family will need to continue to be involved and act as his advocate.

Hospice also offers counseling for immediate family members. It's worth talking to them about this. Anticipatory grief is very real, and very, very difficult for the caregivers. Having a professional at least listen and offer solid advice is valuable. Meet the social worker - they are there to help **all of you**.

Hospice does not typically offer 24-hour in-home care. If your FIL gets to a point where he needs that, then friends, family, 3rd-party care will probably need to be put on the schedule, in order to provide relief to you and your family. That being said, Hospices often have a facility in the area where people can go at the bitter end (although some insurance plans will cover that care for various time frames - this is another area where the social worker can help), or for getting an acute issue (like respiratory issues, pain, whatever) under control.

BUT, your FIL will have a visiting nurse who will probably schedule weekly check ins. If he needs to be visited more frequently, they'll do so. They'll change that schedule as best suits his needs. They have after-hours nurses as well, so if something comes up, you call their emergency number (not 911).

Hospice is the new ER, the new 911, for your FIL. This isn't to say they won't send him to the hospital if, say, he gets pneumonia. This means you call Hospice FIRST, and then if they want him to be admitted, THEY'LL call the hospital and get things ready for him (at least in the networks my mom was in).

They will also have volunteers who can help with bathing. They will prescribe equipment as needed (like oxygen tanks, commodes, hospital beds, that sort of thing). They will handle the logistics, and make sure your FIL has all the things he needs to have as much comfort as possible.

I had *some* unhappiness with Hospice toward the end, and I need to add this: Someone in the family or trusted friends needs to keep an eye on him. This means: watching his appetite, checking his pill dispenser every day or giving him his meds; being there during the nurse visits. Hospice isn't infallible.** Keep a daily log.** What he's eaten, any med changes, even bowel movements. This is invaluable to the caregivers to ascertain palliative care, and to intervene if he is experiencing anything they can relieve. It also helps you, as his meds will change a lot. I referred to that part of my log all the time. It got confusing otherwise.

When we put my mother into the facility, her last week of life, my husband and I stayed with her around the clock. She had ""terminal restlessness"" - a very common issue with people toward the end. She was confused because of the amount of drugs she was on, she wanted to get out of bed, she was also, I'm sure, acutely bored, scared, and frustrated with it all. They didn't have the staff to sit there with her (not that I wanted to be away from her), so be prepared, still, to have people available to be there with him.

OK, whoa, this is getting too long. Final recommendation: There are some great books out there - easy to read, and helpful. ""Nearing the End of Life"" by Sue Brayne and Peter Fenwick was particularly helpful to me. Hospice will also have guides that will be useful.
Overall, I was incredibly grateful for Hospice, and will forever tout their work. But it doesn't let other caregivers and loved ones off the hook.

All the best to you and your family. This is so hard, yet it's also a time where strange beauty can be found. It's hard to describe the experience. Take care of yourself, and take care of each other.

Hospice care can help with the pain and he can be at home, not waiting in emergency rooms for hours in the middle of the night.

They are planning to take a flight to Houston in two days for a check up on the surgery he had last year on the tumor in his leg- sarcoma.

my father has very late stage prostate cancer and unfortunately has not made any financial preparations at all.  his health has recently declined to the point where he *needs* assisted living care.  after a visit to the hospital about a month ago his doctor put him on hospice care but then prescribed medication which made him ineligible for hospice (zytiga, xeloda and temodar).

as i mentioned before, he has not prepared for this at all.  he has medicare which covers a lot specific to drugs/doctors but that is basically the only financial relief we have.  no assets at all and savings is around $3,000.  the finical implications of this are coming down on my family and i don’t know what to do because we cannot afford it.

assisted living facilities, on the low end, cost around $2-3000 per month and it will break us.

The 5 deafening words my step dad dropped on me this evening...




In February of this year I was living in California when my step dad was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. My mom asked if I could come out and help as she can't take care of him full time and balance everything else. By March I made it to South Dakota. While this is not the first time I have seen cancer at work, this is the first time I would be living with family while we embark on the emotional roller coaster together.




I knew what I was doing would be hard. Moving out of state to where the only two people I knew were my mom and dying step dad. But I have tried to make the best of it. I work part time, and spend the rest of my free time helping out where I can. 




My step dads health was slowly declining over the months, but at the start of October it took a turn for the worse. He had his standard chemo treatment but just did not bounce back like usual. This led to an 18day stay in the hospital where he also received several rounds of radiation treatments followed by more after he got home this week. The tumors in his body are eating away at his bones.




After what seemed to be a good evening last night (watching the giants take the World Series) with plenty of laughter, I thought we would make it through this month strong. However, today he took a turn for the worse. He is sweating bullets but if we take a blanket off he is shivering cold.. While sweating... Back to the hospital. 




As my mom was talking to the doctor he looked at me with a straight face from his wheel chair and said ""I made the wrong choice."" I was stunned, we have talked about chemo and it prolonging him and his quality of life before, but I have never heard him be so blunt about the whole ordeal. There was no hope in his voice or in his eyes. All I could do was put my hand on his shoulder while sightly crying. 




To all those going through similar situations, my heart goes out to you. Cancer is an awful thing, but I still can't help but wonder which is worse. The cancer which is killing him, or the chemo which is giving him extra time. "
Wolfgangus,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2kuupk,6,clp4kiz,"I have a close friend whose father was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. After his second round of chemo, he became so horribly sick he was hospitalized and literally expressed his wish to have it all end right then and there. He recovered, and decided that he was done with chemo. He would accept only palliative radiation, and otherwise he entered hospice. 

His dx was in May 2009. He quit chemo in September of that year. He lived until April 2011. People have this idea that hospice doctors are all about dying, but in fact in many ways they're quite the opposite: they encouraged him, while he still could, to travel, to visit friends, and in general make the most out of the time he had. 

As he said to me at one point about a year into hospice, ""If your quality of life is going downhill and you feel like sh*t, added months don't mean anything. They lose all value."" 

In patients with advanced stage, inoperable and incurable disease, it's a fallacy to assert that chemo is the right choice all the time. Yes the cancer will kill them but in many cases the harsh treatments kill them sooner. 

There's no shame in your dad saying he made the wrong choice; the system is actually set up so that people make that choice (meaning aggressive treatment), chiefly because they're rushed into making the decision, and treatment-- which is often under the veil of ""living"" always looks like the right one when set against the alternative, which is incorrectly cast as ""dying""-- even when the physicians and other health care professionals know that it might only extend life for a couple of months and those months will be miserable. Keep in mind that oncologists want to treat patients, they want to try and save them, often whether or not it's in the best interests of those patients.

Her oncologist started her on a new medicine but warned us that if this doesn't work, he's not sure what to do next.

I think we were all very hopeful up to this point, but reality is starting to set in; ultimately, I'm still hoping for the best, but also want to prepare for the worst. I am relatively young (23) and have a younger sister who just started high school. I want to work to preemptively preserve my mom's memory, but I'm not sure how to do this.

But the gist is, it helps to have family and patient, or family/patient/social worker/palliative care counselor, ask the following 4 questions of the patient:

1) what is his or her understanding of the current health condition?
2) what are the patient's goals?
3) what are the patient's fears?
4) what are the tradeoffs the patient is unwilling to make (e.g., intubation for extension of mortality, never leaving the hospital)

My father-in-law was diagnosed with colon cancer about one year ago.  
He had surgery to remove it, but they found cancer in three nodes while they were in there. At that time, they recommended chemo, to which  he declined. He decided at this time to drastically change his diet instead and fight it using traditional ""chemical"" ways. They gave him about 1-year to live based on his health at that time. He also questioned whether they were even right in diagnosing cancer in the first place (denial).  
  10 months later, he is experiencing an incredible amount of pain 24 hours a day in the abdomen. He thought for sure it was a mistake from his surgery, and believed it was infection. He had an ultrasound last week and they determined that the pain was being caused by a giant cancer mass in his abdomen - and that his liver was full of cancer.

My father-in-law was diagnosed with colon cancer about one year ago.  
He had surgery to remove it, but they found cancer in three nodes while they were in there. At that time, they recommended chemo, to which  he declined. He decided at this time to drastically change his diet instead and fight it using traditional ""chemical"" ways. They gave him about 1-year to live based on his health at that time. He also questioned whether they were even right in diagnosing cancer in the first place (denial).  
  10 months later, he is experiencing an incredible amount of pain 24 hours a day in the abdomen. He thought for sure it was a mistake from his surgery, and believed it was infection. He had an ultrasound last week and they determined that the pain was being caused by a giant cancer mass in his abdomen - and that his liver was full of cancer.   
With that information, he is still just at home, suffering in pain each and every day (refuses to take medication for even the pain). Nobody here knows what to expect (his wife or his kids).

Chemo is only an option at this point to shrink the cancer in the liver and perhaps lessen his pain and give him a bit more time...
Palliative surgery - if it would reduce the pain, I'm sure he'd be interested, however, his belief that the initial surgery caused ALL of these problems makes the likelyhood of his choosing to have surgery again almost zero.
Pain - doctors can only offer morphine at this point, which he hates. I have made him some cannibas oil, which he likes, but he doesn't like being ""medicated"" 24/7 - and since the pain relief with the cannabis oil is only temporary, he doesn't want to be ""stoned"" all the time now...

My mom was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 lung cancer last February.  She was coughing a lot, but other than that, she was doing pretty well. Earlier this year she started to get worse, and in the last couple of months she's gotten drastically worse, and now she's at the point where she's stuck on the couch, unable to do anything or go anywhere (except chemo). We even have to use a wheelchair to take her to the bathroom, which is only about 20-30 feet away. She's been on an oxygen machine 24/7 since the hospital accidentally punctured her lung while trying to change the IV port in her chest in the middle of the year.

She gets moments where she can't breathe and her oxygen level plummets, and we have to turn the oxygen machine up (she normally keeps it at 4 now, but it goes only up to 5). We have to wait in suspense to see if her oxygen level goes back up. It always does, but the past week, each day it's been taking longer and longer. If it takes too long we're supposed to call 911, but I don't know what happens from there. My dad said she would have to be put on a ventilator, and she'd never be able to come off of it.

She's in so much pain, her quality of life is terrible, and when she can't breathe it sends her into a panic. Sometimes she writes on a whiteboard because talking makes her cough too much. She doesn't have an appetite and she's lost a lot of weight since her last hospital stay in October (she had pneumonia), but she still eats bread. It's so hard being helpless. There is nothing we can do, and I don't know what to expect anymore.  I spend my nights worrying I'll find her dead on the couch, or having to make that dreaded 911 call.

I know no one will have the answers because cancer doesn't follow a nice ""this is what happens at point A, B, C,"" but I wish I knew how far or close to the end she was. Does she have weeks left? Months? I know it's not years anymore. I'm very grateful she was still able to move around and go places the first year, despite chemo making her feel terrible. I'm trying to enjoy every moment I spend with her, but stress is making me disassociate with reality. But I have no one to talk to IRL about this, because I don't want to stress my family out even more by getting worked up.  (we're a loving family, but we never express it. We don't hug or say ""I love you"" often at all, and sometimes I wish we did because maybe it would be easier to deal with). I almost feel like I need to step away from the stress for a few days, but I don't want to leave and come back to her dead or permanently in the hospital on a ventilator, unable to talk to me ever again.

You're being completely realistic - there's no crystal ball, which is **frustrating**, but someone should be able to tell you with some certainty what her prognosis is. It does seem that Hospice is less shy about sharing that than your typical oncologist, though. Based on my experience, the oncologists want the patient to survive, even if the odds are clearly stacked against that. Hospice wants the patient to be comfortable. Neither is wrong - it's whatever the patient determines is best for them.

My mom had breast cancer which metastasized in her lungs - and everybody's different, so I'm not sure if palliative care would be the same. When she went on Hospice, she took Haliperidol, dexamethasone, ativan, and a number of other meds. She went from using the oxygen only at night, to having it on ""10"" all the time. Eventually she was admitted to the Hospice center to get on liquid oxygen.

This assessment and planning does not have have to wait for after she's done with chemo, and should not wait

My primary concern is that she has terrible pain and breathlessness - these can be helped and she can be more comfortable. Her opioid pain medicine also helps with shortness of breath.  If it takes a while to kick in, talk to the doctors about her regimen - she can take it regularly or take long acting - it's always easier to stay on top of it than play catch up

Unfortunately you're in a catch-22 - you need someone qualified to make a prognosis, but she will not see someone. I used to be a medical student before my own diagnosis, and bleeding was often seen in late stage cancers (as well as anemia of chronic disease). I suspect she will inevitably end up in the hospital for complications of untreated cancer - e.g. severe anemia from bleeding, or some other complication. When this happens there will be many tests run, and there will also be doctors who can be asked about her condition. Until that time, live and let live. I suggest you continue educating yourself on end-of-life topics and palliative care.

Anyhow, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer about 15 years ago and had surgery, radiation, and chemo.  Just over a year ago, she learned that the cancer was back, but that it had metastasized and that she now had tumors in and around her lungs.

The prognosis wasn't spectacular, and having already gone through the experience of chemo and radiation, my mother decided that she didn't want to do either of those this time.  She was also offered some sort of hormone therapy that the oncologist said would not cure the cancer, but would slow its progress.  Afraid that the side effects of that would diminish her quality of life, she declined to go through with that therapy as well.

I have absolutely no issue with my mother deciding not do the therapies offered by her oncologist.  With her prognosis, I know that quality of life is very important to her and she doesn't feel she will get that with the chemo or other traditional therapies. This is where my conflict comes in. She has decided to go with non-traditional therapies which I feel are a load of crap, but, again, this is her choice.  

Perhaps I am being selfish, but I would rather she spend her time enjoying life, visiting with friends and family, etc., instead of ""researching"" Gerson or Protocel or whatever other ""alternative cure"" is out there.  In the year since her last diagnosis, her cancer has progressed and is now in her liver and bones and she has also had a spot removed from her scalp.  

I can't pretend to imagine what she's going through.  Perhaps I would try whatever I could if I were in her shoes...I really don't know.  Sometimes I just want to tell her to wake up and realize that these things aren't going to cure her, but I also don't want to make her think that I've given up or that she should give up.  Actually, I think I would be relieved if she said, ""I know that this cancer is going to kill me, but I'm going to enjoy whatever time I have left.""  There's a difference between giving up hope that you're going to be cured and giving up on your joy for life.

I guess my issue lies in the fact that I feel she's spending all her time and energy one what I see as hopeless ""cures"" when I think the time would be better served just enjoying her time with my father, her mother, her grandkids, etc.  Maybe that is selfish of me...I don't know.

Now I'm just babbling.  Sorry for the wall of text.  It was good to get some of that out, so thanks for that, at least.

He isn't married, he has no kids. His brother is living abroad. They gave him a year at maximum, I think. He does have insurance, luckily, but his financial situation sucks. He even lives in a house with a temporary contract at the moment. I'm in the Netherlands, so USA-societies and such can't do anything for him.

I still would love to hear about other peoples experiences. What can I and his other friends do for him? I'm still a bit shocked by the news. I love this guy like a surrogate older brother. I will probably adopt his cat. The beast has lived in my house for 10 months a few years back when he was travelling, we get along. It's the least I can do to have one thing he shouldn't worry about.  

I don't mind going to appointments and such with him. And maybe we should have a look what is possible for hospices when that time is near. But in the meantime I guess I need some plan... something I know that could help him. He's not really a planner himself. Usually goes with the flow a bit. (Which is why his finances suck and he has no house to really call his own at the moment.) You can live like that when you have nothing to fear, but that has changed now. I need to know the thing that he won't think of himself. If I'm already feeling shocked, it must be so much worse for him.

Any tips and stories will be appreciated. I feel like I need to get a grip on this in case he won't. Our relationship works a bit like that anyway, so I hope if I step up he can grasp on to that a bit. I like to celebrate his life in the last year he has and don't want to see him spend it in downward depression. "
fallingbackward,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2qz8pr,3,cnb1izx,"I was diagnosed with stage 3C rectal cancer when I was 29. Let's establish that I don't believe in most alternative cancer ""cures"". However chemo treatment means different things to different cancers at different stages. From what I remember of my own research, late stage colorectal chemo is NOT a cure even at my stage 3. With late stage colon cancers chemo is only statistically likely to increase the time between your current treatment and when the cancer returns and you have to start new treatment. Statistically it does not increase your chances of overall survival. In stage 4 cases you are prolonging life or providing palliative care not providing a cure. Also keep in mind that chemo makes you feel more terrible than can be described to someone who hasn't directly experienced it. I am lucky enough to be sitting here a year and a half after treatment, relatively healthy, but I have already started dropping hints to my family that if it comes back I won't be choosing active treatment again. I have known more than a couple of cancer friends that had to make the tough decision to stop treatment because of quality of life issues. These are ultimately your sisters decision and if she is getting good information you will have to respect that she is the one that has to live in her body and gets to make those choices whether you like them or not. What you can do is make sure she gets good information when she wants it and has time to just be as close to normal when she doesn't want to think about the tough stuff at the moment. What I'm saying is you are both correct in a terrible situation where being correct doesn't actually help or improve the situation. Alternative cures are not going to help her but in the long run neither is the chemo. Her choice is whether she wants to live longer and deal with being miserable most of the time or enjoy what limited time she has left to the fullest. What you can do is be there and be supportive and help her make good memories with whatever time she has left. ",t3_2qz8pr,t1_cnb1izx,2015-01-01 07:15:22,,,"My sister has colon cancer. She wants to go for natural ""medicine"" instead of chemotherapy. Help me convince her to keep doing chemo. More info in my post inside.","Hello reddit.  My sister has stage 4 colon cancer which has spread to her liver.  She did 8 weeks of chemo which helped to shrink the tumor in her colon and liver.  The doctors cut out the colon cancer and it is now gone, so now the liver is left.  The tumour in her liver is attached to a vein or something and they cannot cut it out until it shrinks out of the way.  The doctors have advised her to do more chemo.  

Meanwhile, she has been taking canabis oil and going to go see other ""healers"".  She talked about vitamin C and other things (probably homeopathy, she wasn't sure)

At this point, she seems to think that chemo does not cure cancer, it only prolongs your life a bit.  She also says that it kills the person more than it kills the cancer.  The term big business also came up when talking about hospitals and ""they just want to make money"".  She also said: ""Do your research, you'll see""  To which I replied, OK.

I'm sure that chemo is really, really hard on the person taking it, I'm not denying that.  But I still think that it's the best option, especially since it's the doctor's recommendation.  So far, she has been delaying her treatment for 3 whole months, and she does not seem to want to keep doing it.  Her blood test numbers (I'm not sure exactly what these numbers are, but I guess they measure cancer levels?) were at 47 at its lowest at the end of her chemo.  They are now in the low hundreds.

I need help finding easy to read information that contains facts about chemo, preferably with statistics.  Anything debunking natural cures as well would help.  I'll continue to do my own research as well, but I would appreciate any help possible.  I seem to remember reading something that compared the rates spontaneous remission to natural cures and found them to be similar or something like that.  Maybe I'm imagining that though because I can't find it.

If any additional information is needed, please feel free to ask."

On rencontre son médecin le 7 pour lui poser des questions. Ensuite, on ira chercher un second avis. Selon ce que j'ai compris lors de notre rencontre avec l'infirmière, c'est que le docteur croit qu'il est impossible d'opérer parce que j'imagine que le cancer est trop répandu. Il a donc suggéré la chimio palliative pour aussi longtemps que possible, pour ralentir et rapetisser la quantité d'ascite. Je ne sais pas s'il y a une chance que mon père réponde assez bien au traitement pour que le cancer réduise assez pour qu'on puisse éventuellement considérer opérer, je devrais demander au doc. 

Ca doit faire quelques années que mon père souffre de cela, si on se fie aux symptômes. Par contre, aucun organe n'est touché, ni son système lymphatique. On a aussi parlé d'une masse dans le cul-de-sac de Douglas. Je ne sais pas si c'est bon signe que ça ne se soit pas vraiment répandu dans le reste du corps et que ça n'ait pas attaqué les organes. 

Je vais demander tout ça au doc dans 2 jours. Je sais pas trop comment je vais faire pour garder mon calme pendant qu'il me parle de cancer inopérable et de chimio palliative... Mon père a 55 ans, j'en ai 31; on ne pensait vraiment pas devoir faire face à ce genre de choses aussi vite... C'est probablement le cas pour toi aussi. Je ne sais pas vraiment ce que je fais. Mais je suis aussi disponible que possible pour lui. Il est travailleur autonome, et n'a pas d'assurances, donc la possibilité que la chimio l'empêche de travailler est très stressante aussi. J'espère seulement qu'il la supportera bien. Il est très en santé et s'alimente bien, donc je croise les doigts.

Merci encore infiniment pour les infos; je demanderai si la PIPAC est une option pour mon père. 

Je te tiens au courant.

For me personally, being a doctor can be about the journey, not the destination. It's about building the relationships and rapport with the patients and their families through what is arguably the most difficult time of their lives. Remember also that doctors have to deal with expected and unexpected deaths in any specialty, not just oncology, and there are plenty of other diseases with poor prognoses and little or no treatments. It's just part of the package of choosing to study medicine and becoming a doctor. I think oncologists and other specialists who grow to dislike their positions don't do so because of slow progress in treatment R&amp;D and treatment options etc - I don't think they would be naive to something like that - but rather because of disillusionment with the medical field in general and your typical workplace politics.

Also remember there are those who specialise in palliative care, where right from the get go you know there is no cure, and your role as a doctor becomes quite unique. My palliative doctor and haemotologist definitely treat me very differently since their goals are inherently different, since one provides a cure/treatment whilst the other provides relief and comfort.",t3_2ru2xn,t1_cnjalli,2015-01-09 07:44:37,,,"Why does anyone become an Oncologist, especially for untreatable cancers?","If you are smart enough to become a doctor, then very quickly you can recognize the lack of available treatments for cancer.

For colon cancer, from what I understood, radiotherapy is palliative only. And from what I observed, there was a lot of hurt from radiation and very little if any palliative effect for my wife.

Looking at the outcome of radiotherapy broadly, do you think that you are actually curing people? I can see the palliative side of it, but does that require a person of your intelligence?

Leinna,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cnjblrr,3,cnjd4a1,"I do feel that I cure people with radiation.  There are many cancers that are curable or have improved cure rates with the addition of radiation.

For colon cancer, radiotherapy is rarely used - the colon moves around too much in the abdomen and surgery is usually sufficient if the cancer is just in place.  Radiotherapy is used a lot more in rectal cancer, the surgery is more difficult and evidence shows a significant benefit.  If colon cancer spreads to a bone or the brain, radiotherapy is an effective palliative treatment.

Although palliative treatments are often 'easier' to do than curative treatments - the dose is lower, the toxicity of treatment is less - it's not 'easy'.

Finding the 'cure' is a long way off I believe.  There are hundreds of cancer types; each cancer is as unique as the person it develops in as it shares their DNA.  Finding a cure for all cancer will probably need methods of individualising treatment on a person-by-person basis at the level of their DNA, and we are just not there yet.

I don't believe that radiotherapy will be the 'final cure' for cancer - it is a tool that we can use at the moment because we have nothing better.

Like /u/Leinna said, its a balance between Cure and Palliative treatment.
Personally, mentally I cope by mentally focusing on the patient's we are aiming to cure, and trying to focus on the benefits we are giving our palliative patients.

Pain relieve is so important in the work I do, and patients whom have multiple treatments tell me how much they appreciate it over relying on drug cocktails.

Truthfully, I love my job, but it mentally destroyed me a couple of years ago, had to take 18 months off, to rebuild myself mentally, so I could continue helping my patients.

I'm happy to see you mention a palliative care doctor.  He'll be the person you rely heavily to keep your dad comfortable.  To answer your questions.

The last days are hard.  You know this already.  You'll watch your father deteriorate.  The first day or two, not that much change, but once you hit the third day without food or water it shows.  And it will be more apparent each day.  My father last 8 days, the doctors felt he only had 3-4.  Your father could possibly stay conscious up till his final hour.  Even though my dad had his eyes shut and struggled for breathe over 3 days, he made direct eye contact with me an hour before he died and cried for a sec.  Literally, a tear came out of each eye.   So make sure to always address him when you are in the room as if he appeared awake, chances are he can hear you, but may not communicate.

Oh!  This is a big thing.  Communication.  During this time from lack of nutrients, your father may lose the ability to communicate to you verbally.  When you ask him a question, try asking him to communicate by using eyebrows, kicking legs, squeezing your hand, or such.  My father was able to wiggle his feet for a day or so to signal yes or no to us.  Also, be sure to pose questions in yes or no formats to make things simple.  

Spend as much time with as you can.  His strength will come and go as his brain will desperately pull every trick to keep his body going.  There may be a random time where he rouses from sleep to a word or two.  

Unless his cancer has also spread to major organs such as the kidneys, brain, or lungs, expect him to pass away gradually.

I will lose my father in the next couple of days. He has peritoneal carcinomatos (the main tumor could not be found, but he has metastases in the entire abdominal area).

He left the hospital because there was no chance of treatment in his age, so we have him at home, supported by a wonderful nurse and palliative doctor. The pressure on this abdominal area now hurts the organs and they are not functioning any more.

I want to prepare for the next days, and I always feel that knowledge helps me dealing with scenarios like this.

How will the last days look like? He is very thin already, can barely eat. Will he at some point get unconscious because of a lack of nutrition and muscle strength to breathe? Or will it be more of a sudden final moment? I understand that it all is very vague, that I can not really know what and how it will happen.

Overall he lived a pretty long and good life. He is not negative in the final weeks, encourages us to stay positive and go our ways.

Make sure you read everything you can about the kind of cancer your mom has. You are going to be her best advocate and you need to be educated about what options she has.

Stay strong and pm me if you have questions and fuck cancer.,t3_2u8hp6,t1_co6bryw,2015-01-31 00:58:35,,,My mom told me she has lung cancer Wednesday. I have no idea how to do this. This is fucked.,"I have no idea if I'm posting in the right subreddit for this or not, but I don't know what else to do. My life changed two nights ago when my mom told me she has lung cancer. I'm 28 and she's 56. She apparently has been coughing up blood for about a month, but got the doctor-process moving as soon as that started happening, but didn't tell me until she was sure.


I need help. I feel completely blindsided and shocked and like I have a limited time left with her. I'm going to try and refrain from being too emotional with this post, so I've written up a pretty facts-only account of everything so far. 

The write up follows below:


So, about a month ago my mom started coughing up blood. at first it started out as only some blood mixed in with spit, but then she ended coughing up only blood. She scheduled a doctor's appt immediately, and they did a cat scan on her lungs, as well as a bronchioscopy .

She told me last night that she has lung cancer.

The doctor found a tumor the size of a fist in her left lung. 

Obviously I was devastated, but for this post at least I'm going to try to keep my emotions out of it. The doctor's (Dr. Smith) findings read as follows:

**Impression:** 
The right lung was normal. A bloody, endobronchial and friable mass was found in the left upper lobe. This lesion is likely malignant. An endobronchial biopsy was performed. Brushings were obtained. 

**Recommendation:** 	

Await biopsy ant cytology results

**Findings:**		
The nasopharynx/oropharynx appears normal. The larynx appears normal. The vocal cords are normal and move normally with phonation and breathing. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The bracheobronchial tree of the right lung was 	examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucose and anatomy in the right lung are normal.	There are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions

A completely obstructing mass was found proximally, at the orifice in the left upper	lobe. The mass was medium-sized and bloody, endobronchial and friable. The lesion was not traversed. Endobronchial biopsies were performed in the left upper lobe of 				the lung using a forceps and sent for hisopathology examination. Five samples were obtained. Brushings were obtained in the left upper lobe of the lung and sent for routine cytology. 

What this translates to is that she has a large obstructive tumor in the upper lobe of her left lung, as can be seen in the diagram below, illustrated by the red box w/ 1 in it [here](http://i.imgur.com/bMiu41F.jpg)

We went to see Dr. X today to for a follow-up visit to figure out what exactly was going on. At this point all we knew is that they had found this tumor, and it was most likely malignant (cancerous). The numbers I read all seemed to break it down to ≈ a 98% chance that it was going to be cancer. That paired with the doctor's impression of it seemed to make it pretty clear that it was extremely unlikely that it was going to be anything but cancer. 

After doing some additional research I found that while it was a bad situation, there were some conditions that, if they were met, would increase both her survivability &amp; available time. The first and obvious thing that we needed is for the cancer to have not metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). The second thing was for the cancer to NOT be ""small-cell"". Small cell cancer is MUCH more aggressive when it comes to spreading and creating a tumor.  Lastly, we needed to know of a surgical removal was an option. If it was, that would increase her chances dramatically. So going into the office at the lung center we were all obviously nervous.

What the doctor told us is as follows:

1. The tumor is absolutely cancer.
2. Lung cancer as a disease seems to spread mainly to lymph nodes, the brain, the liver, and bones.
3. It is NOT small-cell cancer. 
4. The cat scan they did on her lungs would also appear to show NO cancer in her lymph nodes. While this isn't 100% indicative the cancer not spreading elsewhere, it is a very good sign.
5. It's worth mentioning that when she was in the hospital for her concussion in the last two weeks, they performed a brain scan where they would have detected cancer, so chances are she's got no spread of cancer to her brain, either. 
6. He is scheduling a PET scan next week, which as it was explained to me is a full-body cat scan to check to ensure that the cancer has not spread.
7. Surgical removal paired with chemo/radiation therapy would be the absolute best chance for her. He went so far as to say that if you can perform a removal and treat what's left with chemo, that then you are able to start using words like ""cure"".
8. He's not entirely sure that she's a good candidate for surgical removal, but the PET scan and an oncologist will help him decide completely. She also has to take a breathing test that will help in that determination. (We really really want her to be able to get the surgery to get this removed.)
9. There are a lot of unknowns at this point-- we don't know how effective chemo treatments will be, how sick it'll make her, whether she'll need chemo, whether it has spread etc.

To be clear though, I asked him  how deep in the woods we are with this, and he replied very quickly with, ""Deep."" 

So things are not great. But there ARE some potentially GOOD things going for her. 

If she can become a candidate for the surgery, survive it, and take the chemo treatments afterward, there's a good chance she can lead a normal life and live for many more years to come.

If she can't have the surgery, then she'll have to rely mainly on chemo &amp; radiation, which may or may not work. He said that it depends entirely on the person and how their body responds to the medicine and radiation used in the process. He said it could do nothing, or it could shrink it down to next to nothing. At that point you're not curing the disease though, you're simply managing it to extend life and quality of life. No guarantees as to whether it'll work or how much time she'll be able to gain. 

If the cancer has spread to other parts of her body though, there's no point in treatment, and you're essentially providing care to keep her comfortable as the cancer runs its course. At that point we're talking not a long time at all.

However, the doctor seems optimistic based on his findings, so assuming that it hasn't spread, we will continue on to what is next, and figure out a course of action from there. If she qualifies for surgery, that will be next up, and if she does not, it'll be chemo and/or radiation.

Can anyone who's dealt with any kind of situation like this or know anything about cancer or just, anything-- can someone give me some feedback here on what to expect? How to help? How to cope? Are the inferences and conclusions that I've come to accurate?


All I can think about is how much I don't want to lose my mom.

After coming down with Jaundice, tests reveal that it has already metastasized to his bones. It's clearly more advanced than was initially thought, and having been initially optimistic, I feel overwhelmingly despairing. He's been told weeks possibly months at best. I'm not sure how to make the most of his time, but want to make sure i soak him up while I can - and give him some great experiences to ease the process. "

I am an only child whose father has been fighting a brain tumor (oligodendroglioma) for 23 years.  Recently, he's been given palliative care and it seems there aren't any options left. He's beginning to take it out on my mom, and she is beginning to break down. I live on the other side of the country and I don't know what to do.


**long version**

For almost as long as I can remember, my dad has been off/on with cancer. When I was young he had a really successful surgery that ended up giving him a new lease on life. About 10 years ago he started to get wildly different opinions on his regular MRI scans, from doctors claiming that nothing was wrong to people saying that he needed gamma knife surgery immediately. He refused to have surgery again because how much it had changed him previously (and because of the wildly different diagnoses). For 10 years after that, he seemed like my normal dad. He was always good natured and had a particular black humor around his condition. 


About a year ago, his MRIs returned with a very fast growth. He got put on chemo but was taken off of it because it didn't help.


Since then, his condition has been rapidly deteriorating. What was once absent-mindedness has turned into blanking in the middle of conversations. His mood has generally become very volatile and he is quick to become frustrated. According to my mom, he will fervently correct people with wrong information. He's also been saying things which I would never would have imagined him saying before, the worst being ""I wish you were dead"" (to my mom). He's had his license revoked for getting into multiple accidents in a short period of time.


My mom is quickly becoming exasperated. She waffles between ""I'm strong, and I can take it"" to calling me and screaming until she bursts into tears. For a long time I thought my mom was abusive, because  every argument would devolve into yelling something was wrong with his brain. From what I am learning now, it seems that his initial surgery actually changed him a lot, and the man that my mom married actually left 23 years ago. All I've ever really known is post-surgery dad, which made me not see it, and drove my mother insane. 


Now that his condition has gotten worse, my mom can't take it. She's told me that her counselor and case worker have told her to move out. I have no idea how this would work, as his drivers license was revoked by the state because of his condition. I do not think he can take care of himself. She is continuing to take care of him, but keeps talking to me about how she is being driven crazy. English isn't her first language (and I don't know her first language... stupid me) so when she gets incredibly frustrated it becomes really hard to understand the difference between venting and things that I should call 911 for.


I have no idea what to do. I don't even know where to begin. I just talked to her about getting more involved with his doctors/palliative care people to see if I can help make some decisions. My mom wants me to have power of attorney. I don't know who to talk to about this, or where to get advice. I don't even understand how I feel about any of this. I'm just left here, feeling terrible and clueless, and worried that I may not have the strength needed to help my parents get through this."
pointywalrus,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_2xieqr,1,cp0mjm9,"No one should have to put up with abuse. I'll quote the ACS [here](http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/acspc-027595-pdf.pdf):  
  
&gt; Patients are more commonly seen as victims of abuse, but what if the patient is the abuser? Again, the stresses of cancer may make your relationship more difficult. If abusive behavior starts after cancer treatment, the doctor should check to see if there are medical reasons for it. Don’t accept abuse just because the patient is sick.  
  
Is there a medical reason behind his change? Is he just coping badly? 
  
  
Also, I agree with others that have suggested hospice care. The ACS has information about hospice [here](http://www.cancer.org/treatment/findingandpayingfortreatment/choosingyourtreatmentteam/hospicecare/hospice-care-toc) and here is another quote:  
  
&gt; Hospice care is used when you can no longer be helped by curative treatment, and you are expected to live about 6 months or less if the illness runs its usual course. Hospice gives you supportive or palliative care, which is treatment to help relieve disease-related symptoms, but not cure the disease. Its main purpose is to improve your quality of life. You, your loved ones, and your doctor decide together when hospice care should begin.

adenocarcinoma,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cp4jzgy,1,cp4oj4v,"I missed something from a previous comment about healing while on chemo. That's not a thing. My cancer is in a type of epithelial cell, so one of the main tactics is to shut off production of all epithelial cells, including skin. That's why I don't have fingerprints right now. They won't operate on me while I'm on chemo. I've gotta be off for at least 3 months before they'll even consider it. That's actually how I got my lung nodules. We had beaten it all down to where it was mostly just scar tissue, and decided to go off of chemo to hopefully cut part of it out. Everything was looking good until one last CT scan a week before the scheduled surgery. BAM! Lung nodules, no surgery! 

After that, I was in a trial for Alisertib. It has since been approved by the FDA for cervical cancer. Unfortunately, it didn't do a goddamn thing for my rectal cancer. 

After a few rounds of that, I was getting pretty sick, so we're now back on FolFIri and Vectibix on alternating weeks. It's what I was on when I got my numbers down to the lowest they've been. It ended up quitting back then, but it's being effective again, so we're going with it.

The long-term plan is to get healthy enough again on the FolFIri/Vectibix plan so that I can get back into another trial. Every drug approved for rectal cancer not counter-indicated by genetic testing has failed for me. We can keep me mostly healthy by switching back and forth between them, but they're never going to cure me. I just gotta stay alive long enough with palliative care to find a new drug that'll cure me. My prognosis has been less than 3 months for just over 2 years now. The 5-year survival rate is somewhere between 6 and 10%, depending on where you look. I feel pretty good though, considering my situation.",t3_2xvje0,t1_cp4oj4v,2015-03-05 01:05:52,,,,

Ok, well this is my first time ever posting here as well as my first time visiting this sub. I had nowhere else to turn and I need someone to talk to.

My mom has breast cancer. She's had it since about 1998 although she kept it a secret from me till I was 16 years old. I'm 22 now. Anyway, lately she's been acting very weird and sickly. For about a month now, she just lays in the bed and sleeps all day. And when she is ""awake"" she barely speaks and when she does speak it's usually things that are random and out of the blue. She doesn't eat much anymore. Her legs and feet are swelling up too. The way she sleeps has changed too. Her eyes will be halfway open and her mouth wide open. It is worrying me because I don't know what's going on with her because she keeps everything related to her cancer a secret from me. 


I don't know what to do. I just look at her and try not to cry. I've even started mentally preparing myself for her (god forbid)  passing. It's just so confusing because not too long ago she was fine! She was acting normal but now she's just.....I don't know. I'm trying to keep it together while typing all this.

EG I was on gemcitabine and carboplatin - kept my hair on, no real terrible side effects in terms of how it felt, it did tank my immune system according to my bloodwork, but I never got sick. Not sure if that one works for lung cancer, but it's an example that yeah, some chemo regimens can be appropriate in a palliative care setting.

Inoperable, the doctor recommended chemotherapy. He said 7 - 10 months no treatment, 10 - 12 with treatment, 12 - 15 if the chemo managed to reduce the size of the tumours. That's what shocked me the most, the little time between no treatment and treatment. Cancer really is a bitch.

My mum, 52, does not have a very strong immune system, she's healthy on the outside but catches viruses very easily and had a very rough childhood with illnesses. The one thing that's important to her (and so is important to me as well) is that she stays herself, she wants to leave the world with dignity and she doesn't want to be a burden on anyone.

Is chemotherapy worth it? This thing is clearly going to kill her (let's be real here) and I think mum would much rather have strong pain medication and something like radiotherapy to stop the blood than to be sick for the rest of her days. I've just heard so much about chemotherapy and I have no idea what to do, what's best for mum, and I think she feels the same way. Any help is much, much appreciated."
adenocarcinoma,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_301qsa,4,cpobs9w,"What does being pessimistic about her prognosis do to make the time she has left any better?

You're right, positive thoughts do nothing to improve the situation either, but there are only two options, and one doesn't make you seem like a dick.

When you're dealing with advanced stage terminal cancer, there's nothing to be done either way. All there is to do now is try to get the most out of what interactions you have left with your mom. Palliative care is all about making the patient comfortable and minimizing pain and suffering. Being a downer doesn't do either of those things.

Nobody's asking you to lie to yourself. It's perfectly fine to look at the facts and know the expected outcome. You can be as pessimistic about your mother's chances as you want with yourself. Just don't project that and ruin everybody else's mood. Not everybody is strong enough to deal with the realities of cancer. 

As an aside to this, I'm someone who deals with my own cancer in what I think is a rational way. I know I'm terminal, and I have no qualms about it. I make more jokes about death than anybody I know. To me, it's a thing to be dealt with and nothing more. To my family, however, it's anywhere from a travesty of cosmic justice to divine punishment for my heresy. You wanna know which people I choose to spend what time I have left with? It's the ones who aren't all pissy about me having cancer, and just go on with life as if nothing has changed, because it hasn't. We're all still going to die, I just happen to know how I'm going out (assuming I don't do something stupid and get myself killed before the cancer gets me). 

In closing, you don't have to be all sunshine and butterflies, but if all you have is pessimism and downer bullshit, keep it to yourself.",t3_301qsa,t1_cpobs9w,2015-03-23 20:33:43,,,"Mom wasn't be totally honest with me, doctor shows me her PET scan","I flew back home to Charlotte from Oakland on Friday and I'm sitting in the airport right now waiting to fly out.

I have innumerable mets on my liver, mets on my spine, my adrenal gland, my hips (one hip even has a pathologic fracture), and possibly my lung. The lung is iffy because that spot hasn't changed, but I mention it because she did. 

I had a full body bone scan in November and a CT in January. Both were clear, the scan had some uptake but not enough to suggest mets at that time. I understand how fast things can progress, and I wish my loved ones could accept this as well. I'm scheduled for a liver biopsy tomorrow and once those results come in we will have a better idea of how long I have. With only the CT report, my oncologist said I had maybe up to a year without treatment. I am choosing not to do more chemo, but will do spot radiation and surgery (if surgery is ever applicable, that is.)

Since last time I posted in here,  my long time boyfriend and I broke up amicably- things were just never the same, I changed so much as I recovered. He's doing great, though, and we still talk. Good human. An old friend of mine and I ended up falling in love, and we were working on moving in together when this Stage IV situation just...simplified **and** complicated everything.

First my grandfather had cancer in one of his kidneys. Hey, no problem, they just took it out. Sure, a man of his age doesn't bounce back quickly, but he got better.  
Then my grandmother got cancer too. She was always quite vague about it, because she doesn't want anyone to worry, but apparently it was a 'belly full of cancer'. But chemo worked. She is fine - or at least she tell us she is and is active again.  
They were going to buy a new mast for their small boat and start sailing again after having to stop because of the cancer.  
One and a half years ago my grandfather started having troubles with his bladder. Some sort of irritation, they said. Then, a few months ago he had cancer in his bladder as well.

I will never forget the day he sat down with me and told me that he was (in my mind giving up) stopping active treatments/testing etc and that he wanted to have quality over quantity.

I am by far no expert in psychology or cancer or anything medical.

Background: I was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer about 2 months ago. I've had a chemo infusion every 3 weeks for the last 2 months. I am also on pill form twice a day. The general consensus was that there was too much spread to do surgery or radiation (mass in esophagus and about 20 lymph nodes spread from lower abdomen to neck to right arm and a lot of inflammation in the abdominal cavity). I had severe reactions to the first two infusions (blood clot and respiratory issues). The third one seemed to go okay. New PET scan scheduled in a couple weeks to determine if the chemo is working or not.

Problem: I've discussed this with quite a few people because they ask. Every time I say that I am dying, people throw hissy fits and tell me to stop being so negative. Any time I say that I will stop chemo and choose quality of life over quantity of life when that time comes, people get mad and say I am giving up.

Question: Why in the FUCK can't I decide to die living life to its fullest rather than shitting/puking on myself in a bed hating myself because I am so sick. Why can't I decide that when I am in too much pain, that I am giving up if I want to take more medicine than my body can handle. I try to explain that I am not giving up. I will fight for as long as I can and then I will choose to live till death rather than fighting. I don't understand why people want me to suffer and die miserably. I don't think I'm that bad of a person. All these people have had family members die from cancer. 

Hell, my own family has watched my aunt, grandfathers, great-grandfathers, great-grandmothers, great-uncles, etc. all die slowly and painfully from cancer or cancer complications.

My mom and my half-brother seem to be the only two people in my family that understand. But my mom sat with my aunt till she died from breast cancer and my half-brother sat with his mom till she died from lung cancer. A few of my friends are on board with this as well.

In the end, I'm going to do what I want anyways, but I just don't understand how I'm giving up unless I'm in misery and suffering from the treatments. 

Why can't I decide when enough is enough.

P.S. No, this isn't a suicide letter. It's a rant about me wanting to be able to decide to live life when it comes time to make my decision.


Edit: I want to thank all of you for your responses. I never gave much thought to it before, the idea that my oncologist brings up about talking to people with cancer or those that have been around it enough. I spent 4 hours today arguing with a married ex-girlfriend over this issue. She swore up and down that I keep saying that I am giving up while I tried to explain that I've been on chemo for 70 damn days, all day, every 12 hours popping pills. Got to take the acid controller, the blood thinner, the chemo, the laxatives for the pain pills, the potassium or should I say watermelon sized pills of choking death, the pain pills themselves.....I mean seriously that does not look like giving up in the least bit to me. But I digress. In the end, you all are right. I'm going to do what is best for me and hope that everyone can accept my decision and remain a part of my life, but for those that can't, I don't have time to waste on them. Again, thank you all.

beamseyeview,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_32i5yu,2,cqbovbx,"I'm really sorry about how crappy the relationship is with the doctor. It may help to specifically mention before the appointment that you would like a family meeting with him and not the PA, or if your mom is uncomfortable being treated by them and it's irreconcilable it can be a reason to switch. 

From the cancer standpoint, it sounds like you really have a handle on what all the steps have been to get to this point. Yes it was stage 4 the moment they found the liver tumours, but the goal was (and maybe still is?? I'm not clear on this) to try to shrink the liver tumours in order for her to have curative surgery. 

Sometimes, when the  cancer has only spread to the liver, and it won't make the liver 'Swiss cheese', it can be cured by taking out the colon and the liver. It is usual to try chemotherapy first to help make it an easier surgery and to make sure the cancer can be controlled in order to prevent putting your mom through a difficult surgery that wouldn't help in the long run.  It sounds like the cancer unfortunately grew on chemo. Talk to the doc but this probably means it is unlikely to become resectable and unlikely to become curable.  It sounds like you and your mom both have that feeling already.

This doesn't mean that palliative surgery to help her diet or relieve obstruction is off the table (has she met a surgeon?), and it doesn't mean she can't have happy and quality filled time with you and your sister. Talk to your doctors about helping her reach that goal 


Edit: I took a stab at translating your oncologists intentions through for story, but really it's best to discuss with him and clarify treatment intent, and goals of care

",t3_32i5yu,t1_cqbovbx,2015-04-14 05:01:38,,,[Rant] I feel like my mother's oncologist sucks and I just need to get everything out,"My mom got diagnosed with colon cancer christmas eve.  On New Year's eve I went to see her GI doctor with her who looked at her scans and said that it'll be a quick and easy surgery, but that the tumors had spread throughout her liver and referred her to an oncologist.  The oncologist convinced her to go on chemo before she got her surgery which means she's been on a stupidly restricted diet since then so that she doesn't get a full blockage.  She can't have anything with peels, seeds, nuts, strings, anything fiberous, or any gassy vegetables, as well as her previous lactose intolerance and sodium sensitivity.  The oncologist wanted to shrink the liver tumors before the surgery to keep them from growing as quickly.  He says that with the amount she has they're inoperable since her liver would be 'swiss cheese' if all of them were removed, and that a liver transplant is off the table.

Fast forward three months, they did another scan and found out that her colon tumor has shrunk, but there were no effects on her liver tumors, they've grown and now there are even more.  From the sound of it, he was aiming at the colon tumor and was hoping it would also help the liver tumors, but those weren't what he was targeting with the chemo.  So now she gets to go on another round of chemo which is much stronger to try to again shrink the liver tumors before she can have her surgery.  Now she's no longer allowed to eat fresh fruit.  Her diet is basically down to carbs and meat, there are only a handful of vegetables she can eat and carrots, mushrooms, beets, and squash can only last for so long.  

My sister is in the army and is trying to get reassigned down here on what's called a compassionate reassignment, and the oncologist's office is seeming to do anything to avoid being helpful.  She went in to get my mother's medical records, and after a week there was no word.  I went in and wanted them, they had no record of my sister's request and they said they'd call me the next day, I never heard from them again.  My sister came down again and had an appointment with the oncologist to discuss things, he basically brushed her off, didn't answer any of her questions, and didn't do a damn thing to help.  She really only needed a summery of her existing condition, preferably a worst-case scenario for the army to reassign her, and he wouldn't even do that.  Simply saying that she's stage four with inoperable tumors and not responding to chemo is all accurate, but he wouldn't do that.  He didn't even tell her what stage she was at!  She only found out she was stage 4 about a week ago and that's because she asked his PA.  Almost all her appointments are with the PA, the doc only pops in at the end to look over things.  We're 3.5 months in and we have no prognosis, not even a range.  I'd like to at least find a best and worst case prognosis, something like ""9 months if she continues to not respond to 10 years if a miracle were to happen with the average expectancy being 2 years"" would be amazing.  Almost 4 months of not knowing what's going on is driving us all mad.

I'm looking to get her on my insurance right now because she's on medicare, but it sounds like they only allow children to be dependents.  

It's hard enough to deal with the fact that my mom's most likely dying, but to be kept in the dark and jerked around is driving us nuts.  My mom's already prone to depression and it seems like she's giving up, she rarely even leaves her bedroom except to go to the bathroom, she even takes her meals in her room.  The only thing I'm really thankful for is her boyfriend (although he annoys the piss out of me) because he's always there for her, always helping, and I don't know what would happen to her if she spent all that time alone."

Maybe this 30 day thing is a-ok with him and he'd like to try going home with backup palliative papers just in case. Maybe he knows he couldn't get the supports he needs to be most comfortable.

Sometimes going all in actually shortens a life and makes it more painful than it needs to be - treatments can be very harsh, as you know. Sometimes palliative care extends a life and makes a person more comfortable than fighting the cancer with everything you've got.

There comes a time in ALL our lives, cancer or not, when fighting for life makes life more difficult and shorter. it's a balancing act and the best way to manage it is with knowledge.

My cousin's husband recently was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that is usually only seen in children.  He initially went in because he was having vision concerns and headaches.  After undergoing a CAT scan, it was discovered that a tumor had formed in the posterior fossa region of the brain.   He quickly was rushed into surgery, and they removed the tumor-- his doctors thought they had removed the entire mass, but it was later found that there were two more masses that were growing rapidly.  

This man is 33 years old, just got married, and has been working as an attorney for the past few years.  The options being discussed are chemotherapy and radiation for an entire year.  The radiation will need to be done over his entire head, and all I can think about is how much that is going to effect his memory, his cognition and will ultimately will lead to his normal, healthy neurons to deteriorate.  

I feel awful for him and my cousin who literally just got married.  She is 26 and just obtained her doctorates in audiology and is now having to leave her position to assist her husband.

Are there any alternative options for him besides radiation and chemotherapy?  I'm just horrified that this intelligent young man is facing a lifetime of disability...  Any advice would be appreciated."

My boyfriend's mother was moved into Palliative Care. She's had very aggressive forms of cancer (I'm not sure which) with low survival rates. Mid-February, she was told that the chemo was not working anymore but that they felt she might have a few years. 

She's now in Palliative Care. I believe she has been there for about a week now.

Looking online, I see that Palliative Care isn't necessarily Hospice, although Hospice includes Palliative Care. I'm not sure if terminology is different either as I'm in America and they're in Australia, but was wondering if anyone knew what this might mean. 

She's having trouble reading, and isn't very comfortable (plus major fatigue as she's barely able to sleep). I asked my supervisor about bereavement leave (would only be given about 10 days including travel, which isn't ideal...) but I'm not sure if this would affect midterms or how I should proceed (I'm an adjunct).

I talked with my department chair today a little. He said there's no installed policy. That he thought I could do 1.5 weeks away (unfortunately, I teach 4 days/week instead of two), and that I might not be paid because with their policy, they might need a substitute. I don't think I'd be able to get 2 weeks. 

If he had a smartphone, I'd ask him if something happened to message me immediately so I could try to get out there immediately. 

I felt awful the other day because usually he's on in the morning and I was joking on his FB with a post asking where he was... then he says (hours later) that he was at the hospital.

My time, attention and love.  I'm just too tired to give it lately.

For example, last night, she wanted to talk about whether or not she should get more treatment, or just turn to palliative care.

Velcros,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_36tol2,3,crh7fur,"My Mother was diagnosed April 1st, passed May 16th. Looking back, I would have done so many things differently. 
My advice: Become informed. Become an expert. 
I could go through many things that we experienced along the way. The obstacles, challenges, how to make humor in tough spots. 
The fact is, it's too hard to take in this early in knowing. You almost have to grieve a little before action is taken. 
My mother was divorced and I'm the oldest and closest logistically, so burden mostly fell on me. Still does. 
More advice: Do everything you can to help. Transportation, errands, chores, doctor visits. Don't complain. Boy, do I feel sheepish for some of the things I whined about. Make a spreadsheet of everything - Meds, appts, financials, friends and phone numbers. Document progression, pains, ways you overcame obstacles. 
Talk to Palliative Care, Social workers or Nurse Navigators and the oncologists themselves. Do not rely on your father to relay messages. 
Ask for help. This is a full time job to the fortieth power.

Lastly: Take a step back everyday and reflect. How did you do today? Emotions running high? Breathe, refocus and plan the next day. 

The important thing to remember is that your dad won't be himself all of the time. He'll be angry, say things he doesn't mean. Brush it all off and focus on the good parts.

The_Gage,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_36vu78,4,crhnlii,"First, I'm so sorry to hear that this is happening to your father.  Rectal cancer is terrible for many reasons.  For one, it often goes undiagnosed for a long time, and second, it can be embarrassing and very difficult for patients due to the associated symptoms.  For what it's worth, in addition to being a survivor, I'm also a doctor.  While I don't have a huge level of experience working with cancer patients and their families, I've been involved in their care and the conversations regarding their health and treatment.

One of the first questions that I personally think every cancer patient should discuss with their family is:  What are the patient's goals?  There are certain facts that can't be changed; this is not a curable disease.  But at a point where all treatment is either palliative or life-extending, it's important to understand what the goals of care should be.  This is a decision your father has to make; he can ask you and his family for advice, but it's a very real and personal question.  How far does he want to go with care?  What sacrifices is he willing to make?  At what point is he willing to stop treatment:  When he can't eat?  When it's too painful?  Is he willing to get an ostomy?  What if he becomes confused and doesn't know who, where, or when he is?  The questions go on, but they are all very important.

These are extremely difficult questions for anyone to answer, and especially to discuss them with family.  But one of the greatest gifts he can give you right now is clearly communicating his wishes so that if or when the time comes, you will understand his choices in his care and, if needed, be able to help him make decisions about his care in the event that he is unable to do so.

It's also important that other family understand his wishes as well.  It can be challenging for other family members who learn later or become move involved in his disease as time goes on.  Ensure that others understand what decisions he is making and why, so that if the time comes, they will not be a roadblock despite their best intentions.

In short, I think it's extremely important to talk about the disease and the fact that it will eventually end your father's life.  While it can be awkward and painful, it will help ensure that your father's treatment and remaining life will be lived with dignity and respect.  I'd encourage you to continue to be there for him, and emphasize how important it is that he talk to you and the family about his goals and wishes.

If you find this difficult, as any normal rational human would, I'd encourage you to look into the palliative care services where your father has been treated.  They are excellent physicians and social workers who can help your father and you ask and answer the right questions, and help ensure his treatment is in line with his goals.

Good luck in the coming days; I hope your father does well.  If you have other questions, I'd be happy to help in the future as best I can.",t3_36vu78,t1_crhnlii,2015-05-22 18:16:50,,,Father diagnosed with type IV rectal cancer - suggestions/advice?,"As stated, my father has been diagnosed with stage IV recital cancer.

He was wearing diapers to keep us from knowing about the bowel issues. He started getting a little jaundiced and I told him he had a tan. Now his eyes are yellow. 

She said all care is palliative now. I believe that everyone has a time, and that's the only thing that gets you - but I feel so guilty and blind like an idiot. I know its eating him but he's the kind of guy who covers up a lot and puts on his brave face. He lost it once a month ago, when he told us it was cancer, and he cried and said he didn't want to die yet, he had so much left to do.

I have to take care of things, because nobody else can. My sister is not an adult in her mind whatsoever; we can't even trust her to turn off the lights or do her own dishes when she uses them. He's divorced, though my mother is helping out since she's a doctor and all that. 

I want to hear advice from others and suggestions. What should I be doing? I visit him every day and we chat, I try to keep him upbeat. But should we talk about the disease? Should we not? Should I let him determine that? I've never really been in a similar situation. I asked detailed questions to his oncologist... He's coming home Sunday, they said (currently inpatient so they can observe the effects of the chemo on his bilirubin and ast and so forth numbers). 

I'm sorry if this is kind of unorganized. I don't feel super miserable yet. Maybe I will later. I feel guilty, worried, but not grieving yet. 

I can't think of what else to write here, really."

She is the most intelligent woman I have ever met and a highly sought-after oncologist but I have never seen her smile. She is terrifying. I suppose when you're in her position that's to be expected. She was polite for the most part and sugar coated nothing which he always appreciated. If you called her anything other than Doctor she tore a strip off of you.


His chemo nurses (one specifally) were amazing. And though it's not a good practice they definitely got attached to my dad. He brightened up a lot of other chemo patients lives and he was generally positive which was rare to see.


His one nurse who had been there since he was diagnosed chose to be our palliative care nurse and came over so much more than she was supposed to when we had him at home during the end, just to make sure we were okay.

AAbraxane,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_37a0pg,1,crnqdaz,"At that point, as others have said have you considered palliative care, they are usually a bit better about providing adequate pain relief, and has he mentioned assisted suicide and if so are you willing to help him access that in a state that provides it?

Not mentioned is an out of the box option - did you consider a methadone program for him. Methadone is about the most hardcore painkiller available, horribly addictive, but with his disease load the long term impacts aren't an issue. It's something I have considered if the pain gets too much and the oncology specialisation can't deal with it. 

Getting an appointment with a methadone clinic doctor and telling them the truth - terminal cancer has given him a massive addiction and tolerance to opiates and he's either going to need to source adequate relief illegally on the black market, commit suicide or get an opiate that does the job and plugs the addiction and pain gap - methadone. 

I don't know anyone who has done this, and I've never heard of anyone who has gone this route, but several pain relief in terminal cancer studies I've read have cvoncluded that ultimately, when the other opiates stop effectively relieving pain, methadone can still keep a lid on the pain, so IMO it may be worth a try to access this drug for him however you can get it.

Another option is terminal sedation, they don't kill him, but they keep him sedated enough that he isn't in constant agony. This way you lose him though in a sense, he will still be breathing, but he wont be conscious. This is, as far as I understand, considered ethical within the medical profession, so it shouldn't be hard to achieve if you contact a hospice. 

Anyway, discuss which ever of these options you think are worthwhile with him, see what he thinks.

Fortunately I'm not in this situation yet, have managed to avoid opiates so far outside of post surgery, so they'll work when I need them, but like your brother I fear that at some point they will diminish in efficacy and I will be left in pain. i will choose suicide at that point personally. 

I wish you the best and hope he finds relief ASAP, in whatever form he prefers that pain relief takes.",t3_37a0pg,t1_crnqdaz,2015-05-28 15:42:11,,,My brother has Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer and is immensely suicidal due to severe pain.,"So my brother is 25 years old, and was diagnosed with stage 4 Colorectal cancer in March of 2014.

I am currently at work. I was told yesterday by 3 doctors that my symptomless and healthy (looking) mom of 61 years has been diagnosed with aggressive, metastasized stomach cancer that has spread everywhere. We will try chemo for 3 months for the sake of trying and seeing it shrink, but then will let her make decisions as to how she wants to spend the rest of her days. She has about 1-3 years and is currently healthy.

We are an immigrant family (I grew up here) so her english isn't very good. I had to be there to listen to the news and translate.
I am basically in shock. I am 27. I had to tell my dad, my grandma, my brother... 
I can't forget the look on her face. We are organizing and being proactive about support but all I feel is distress and emptiness.
My mother worked her ass off her whole life and finally when she begins to relax, this happens.

How did you cope? What are some suggestions and advices?

My mother aged 50 as well has been diagnosed with Lung cancer about 1 month ago. except its Stage 4 with wide spread metastasis. Weird thing is... she doesn't have any symptoms except for the cough.

My mother does have the EGFR mutation so she will be under going Target Therapy, but that will still be hard for her as well.

I think we're in the similar boat... I'm 22 years old and I have a younger brother hes 15 and we both know what the situation is and how long she potentially has.

Id say stay strong, even at stage 3b its near incurable. he will have to go on palliative treatment most likely to extent his life-span just like my mother.

Single tumor in lung is less than 3cm, mediastinal LN involved. We were told to wait for genetic results before meeting with Onc and only had our first meeting with him yesterday. Apparently they only screened for 4 genetic markers, and we've only so far gotten the results back for 3 of the 4. We know the tumor is Kras-, ALK-, ROS1-. We are still waiting to hear back on the EGFR. 

I want to push for a full genetic panel, but Onc says to wait. That if EGFR is neg then we have to start standard chemo - platinum agent with premetrexed. 

Also, the PET scan showed one small suspicious spot on one vertebra where my dad injured his back over 20 years ago. Instead of seeing it as coincidental inflammation, they want to repeat an MRI and compare it to MRI he had a few years ago. I feel like their intention is to prove that he has stage IV disease rather than developing the best treatment plan possible for my dad. 

My dad is very athletic, has been playing tennis for at least hours every day for the past 10 years, sometime more than 5 hours a day. Aside from a little cough, he feels almost back to normal. He has never had any serious illnesses or injuries. 

I don't know how to break it to my younger brother who is still in elementary school that daddy has cancer. 

Wondering about how to find an oncology team that will actually look out for their patient's best interest. Also looking into perhaps family counseling or counseling for children.

Back then she wasn't showing any signs that there was anything wrong, they just happen to see something during a cat scan.  So they decided to schedule a biopsy, which got postponed for two weeks because the doctor wasn't available.  Meanwhile, I noticed that she's been starting to cough a lot at nights, and she mentioned that she's having trouble going to the bathroom.  

So about a week ago the final results came in.  Stage 4 lung cancer.  I don't have access to the files because my parents don't want me to worry too much, but I know it has spread to two ""lymph nodes"" but nowhere else, and apparently it's inside rather than outside? I'm just beginning to learn about all this.  Anyway, now they've scheduled another appointment to talk about treatments in two weeks.  I've noticed that she's been getting weaker and weaker every day, and it scares me that more than two months has passed and nothing has been done yet.  Is this normal procedure? Shouldn't they try to do the treatment while she's healthy, rather than when she's weaker? 

I realize that most cancer is ""random"", but this whole thing has been such a surprise.  No one in our family history has every had cancer.  I don't know how, of all things, this could happen to her.  "

ThrowawayEOL,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_39eio2,3,cs3cq0x,"My dad started palliative care in May as well: lung cancer. Weakness and lethargy and disorientation are setting in. The medications from hospice can contribute to this as well, because the primary goal is pain management, not consciousness management. I'm finding that they can overprescribe medication and it's up to the caregiver to adjust it after seeing how the person responds.

Dealing with everything and having things run more smoothly are different but related goals to have. You can't control how hard someone is hit by these things. Be there, do things with them, don't let the cancer consume the family.

What'll help a lot is to stay organized and ask for more help from palliative care. I made printouts for my mom and I to track the medication and the changes that are being made each week to adjust to the deteriorating condition of my father.

My dad hates loud noises now and just asks for quiet a lot. I don't know if that's what you're going through but that can be hard for a 10 year old.

I am losing my father.,"Back in October I posted on here about my dad. He had headaches for about a year that doctors couldn't figure out. Then one day, they discovered a growth on his kidney. 11 cm tumor. Renal cell carcinoma, with 99% sarcomatoid features. Sarcomatoid means more aggressive, more deadly. 

We had a relatively peaceful period of time from his diagnosis and nephrectomy in October until the cancer reached his bones in March. Sure, the drug that he was on beat him up. But he was cooking dinners, driving, going out to the bar for a beer with his brother on St. Patrick's day. He was still my dad.

In March, the cancer reached his spine. We were told this was ""news, and good news"". The good news was supposed to be that he would now be eligible to cross over to an experimental trial with a very promising new immunotherapy. 

In the next twelve weeks, my father aged twenty years. The pain in his spine became so terrible that he could no longer walk. He was hospitalized due to the pain, and returned from the hospital weak, heavily medicated, and with a hacking cough. 

Numbness in his right leg caused his oncologist to recommend radiation starting immediately to shrink the tumor. We began the process of driving him back and forth to Yale New Haven on a daily basis to receive treatments. Because my brother and I both work, my 62 year old mother brought my father to his treatments, an hour away, every day for ten days. 

About a week after radiation, the pain in his spine started to subside, just in time for severe arm pain to begin. He was hopeful - maybe he slept on it wrong, or strained it getting out of bed. The doctors x-rayed it and found a tumor. The cancer had spread to his humerus. 

Radiation began on his arm. Due to the pain medication he was on, he became severely constipated and couldn't urinate or move his bowels for four days. He was bloated and in so much pain that he begged to be brought to the ER. Here, an unskilled ER doctor manually decompacted his bowels. My father's screams of pain could be heard through the entire ER. 

X-rays to determine the extent of his bowel compaction revealed the growth of new metastases. I peeked at the x-ray over the doctor's shoulder and my heart sank. I'm not a doctor, but I saw irregularities everywhere, warped bone everywhere, masses I couldn't possibly call organs. 

Because of the protocol of the trial, my dad would not be officially rescanned until June and we would receive no consultation on his treatment plan until then.

Then, just a week after he returned from the hospital due to his bowel compaction, he was sitting in bed when suddenly he heard a pop and turned grey from the pain in his arm. We brought him to the ER in an ambulance. The cancer had snapped his arm, straight through the bone.  I have never seen someone in so much pain. Two surgeries were done to repair the break and install a metal rod to stabilize the bone.  My strong, wise father, a Navy veteran, a skilled computer programmer, a man of pride and courage, cried like a baby and looked into our eyes in pleading desperation when he awoke. The pain was unbearable.

Last week we received the results of his 12 week scan. The ""miracle drug"" does not appear to be such a miracle for my dad. The cancer has spread to his lungs, lymph nodes, adrenal gland, kidney bed, behind his esophagus, and worst of all... more bones. His shoulder, scapula, upper and middle back. Each bone metastasis means the possibility of his bones literally being crushed from the inside out. He lives in pain, panic and fear. We are not a family of faith or religion. He dreads death and wants to keep fighting. But, our options are becoming more and more limited. He is becoming weaker and weaker. He drinks Ensure shakes as meals and is only awake for brief periods of time in the day. We don't know what treatment options he will qualify for at this point. He's not ready to throw in the towel, and neither are we... but if you look up sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, you'll understand. Nothing really exists to treat it effectively. 

I love my dad. I miss my dad already. My life has been completely transformed. I moved in with my parents to help out. Every day it seems like there is a new complication. My mom, his primary caregiver, is starting to have breakdowns.

About a week after radiation, the pain in his spine started to subside, just in time for severe arm pain to begin. He was hopeful - maybe he slept on it wrong, or strained it getting out of bed. The doctors x-rayed it and found a tumor. The cancer had spread to his humerus. 

Radiation began on his arm. Due to the pain medication he was on, he became severely constipated and couldn't urinate or move his bowels for four days. He was bloated and in so much pain that he begged to be brought to the ER. Here, an unskilled ER doctor manually decompacted his bowels. My father's screams of pain could be heard through the entire ER. 

X-rays to determine the extent of his bowel compaction revealed the growth of new metastases. I peeked at the x-ray over the doctor's shoulder and my heart sank. I'm not a doctor, but I saw irregularities everywhere, warped bone everywhere, masses I couldn't possibly call organs. 

Because of the protocol of the trial, my dad would not be officially rescanned until June and we would receive no consultation on his treatment plan until then.

Then, just a week after he returned from the hospital due to his bowel compaction, he was sitting in bed when suddenly he heard a pop and turned grey from the pain in his arm. We brought him to the ER in an ambulance. The cancer had snapped his arm, straight through the bone.  I have never seen someone in so much pain. Two surgeries were done to repair the break and install a metal rod to stabilize the bone.  My strong, wise father, a Navy veteran, a skilled computer programmer, a man of pride and courage, cried like a baby and looked into our eyes in pleading desperation when he awoke. The pain was unbearable.

Last week we received the results of his 12 week scan. The ""miracle drug"" does not appear to be such a miracle for my dad. The cancer has spread to his lungs, lymph nodes, adrenal gland, kidney bed, behind his esophagus, and worst of all... more bones. His shoulder, scapula, upper and middle back. Each bone metastasis means the possibility of his bones literally being crushed from the inside out. He lives in pain, panic and fear. We are not a family of faith or religion. He dreads death and wants to keep fighting. But, our options are becoming more and more limited. He is becoming weaker and weaker. He drinks Ensure shakes as meals and is only awake for brief periods of time in the day. We don't know what treatment options he will qualify for at this point. He's not ready to throw in the towel, and neither are we... but if you look up sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, you'll understand. Nothing really exists to treat it effectively. 

I love my dad. I miss my dad already. My life has been completely transformed. I moved in with my parents to help out. Every day it seems like there is a new complication. My mom, his primary caregiver, is starting to have breakdowns. 

I hate cancer. "
daelite,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cs9vtmz,0,csag2ky,"Thank you for this. My younger sister isn't doing well right now.  They're to start palliative chemo on Friday. A more aggressive treatment than she had earlier this year. My BIL warned me that it could get bad &amp; for 2-3 days following treatments she's not to be alone.  I'm going to be staying with her on Sunday because hubby has to work. I wasn't able to be with her as often as I should have the first time, but I'll do whatever I can to lighten the load for them now. I have to admit I'd ostracized myself from her because I thought she didn't need me,  now I know how wrong I was. Also, I was afraid &amp; finding my courage has been difficult....but I've come to believe the struggles we have overcome in life give us strength we never expected we'd need. I'm counting on that strength in the days, weeks &amp; months ahead;  hoping I have some to spare for her husband &amp; son to draw from as well.",t3_3a4oyt,t1_csag2ky,2015-06-18 06:07:31,,,,

Those were the last things he said before he lost the ability to speak yesterday.   This morning I was saying things like ""I wish I could understand what you're trying to say, but I guess I'm too incompetent."" ""I'm going to give you your morphine now, hope this isn't harassing you too much."" ""I don't like to leave you alone, but you told me to leave you alone so I'm going out now.""

A few hours later I apologized and told him that I loved him, but I don't know if he could hear me any more. and so our last words to each other were angry ones.   Just another thing I'll spend the rest of my life regretting.

EDIT because I forgot the most important part, I wanted to say remember every time you talk to someone with cancer it may be the last time, so never forget that."
daelite,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3asru5,5,csfxruu,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. My sister has cervical cancer, she was diagnosed stage 2b in Dec '14. She had so many people surrounding her I didn't think she needed me. She went through her first round of chemo/radiation without me there, something I felt the guilt about it the entire time. I didn't think she had the energy for more people. Now in May she and I were renewing our connection, (she's not only my little sister (34) but she's been my best friend, biggest supporter since she was 12.) we found out the cancer has spread and she is now considered terminal. The doctors are guessing 4 months to a year since the cancer is in her stomach, spine (possibly more than just her spine, but her bones), and she had a swollen lymph node biopsied that they never told me the results of. She's on palliative chemo now. Anyways, I'm there now. We've not talked about anything past me being there whenever, for whatever she needs. It was very difficult thinking of her sick, like I failed her, I couldn't protect her. I knew something was wrong for a year and didn't push her enough to get to the doctors, if I had they may have caught it in time to put her into remission. I know I can't blame myself, but having a sibling ill (our older sister had breast cancer about 7 years ago) I felt helpless. I could do nothing for her, now I know I just needed to be THERE to support her and give her what strength I had. I'm just trying to put some perspective on your sibling's behavior. Thinking about the mortality of my sisters just about killed me, but I was being selfish; I realize that now. I'm not trying to minimalize what you are feeling, by no means. 

You shouldn't have to be telling them, but do it anyways. Tell them: I NEED YOU, I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO, I NEED MY BROTHER/SISTER NOW LIKE NEVER BEFORE.  I wish my sister had come out and told me. When our time on this Earth is gone, there is no more second chances. I want no regrets, hopefully they don't either. 

You're wife is there because she loves you, that's what marriage is about, in sickness and in health. If my husband were ill and not talking to me about his feelings, etc. I'd be even more lost. I hope she is finding support somewhere as well. Maybe a family cancer support group in your area? My prayers are with you and your family. 

P.S. I hope this isn't out of line. ",t3_3asru5,t1_csfxruu,2015-06-23 14:57:50,,,My support network is a failure and I need help.," Five years ago I finished chemo for stage 3 d 3 colon cancer. I was told I had a 20 percent chance of recurrence. 

It is back and terminal. They are putting in the port this Thursday and start Folfuri next Monday. They say average life expectancy is two years.

I have four core people in my life that I would turn to for support.


My Aunt/Godmother I texted her two weeks ago with the news. I asked if we could talk and she replied that that specific day was not good for her but that she was there for me. I tried the next day and got messaged back that it was ""crazy"" there and again not a good time. I kind of left it at that.... I have not heard form her since. I don't know how to deal with this. I was told by my mother that if there was ever anything wrong I could turn to my Aunt. That was reinforced by my Aunt numerous times.

 My brother, whom wont call even though he knows I need help.

My step sister, the most interactive only has short bursts of 5 min time blocks once a week for me. ""Ohh my dinner is ready"" I was just heading out the door etc. She clearly does not have time.

My wife, she is so perfect so gentle and so willing to listen.. I cannot shove all my fears ,doubts frustrations on her. She is already full with her own thoughts on this. She cannot be the soul bearer of my support. She has to work 50 hrs a week to keep the health and life insurance. 

My children, my 7 year old son and 5 year old daughter. I have to spare them the melodrama. They are the most awesome little things and this is going to suck for them as it is. They do not know at this time.

If he becomes impotent, he can just get some dick pills, then he can look  like a Cialis commercial!

The last thing a doctor wants is their patient to be in pain and/or discomfort - get them to prescribe things in advance. Ask if the chemo can cause acid reflux - if it can, get them to prescribe an antacid. Also get them to prescribe an anti-emetic (anti-nausea med).

If it doesn't work, he would be in as much discomfort in pain if he didn't try it, if not more. If it gets to that point, which I doubt it will, they have palliative and hospice care programs that could make his time very comfortable.

The mass in his rectum is blocking about 50%, and several nodes are cancerous as well. He is 64 years old, and is in pretty good shape. 

Today he met with the Chemo specialist, who described the recommended treatment. He will have a port installed and receive 6 weeks of continuous chemo, while at the same time receiving radiation treatment. After which he'll have a surgery to remove the tumor and he'll be fitted with a colostomy bag. At that point he'll have another 4 months of chemo. 

My dad is a very ""young at heart"" kind of guy, he's got a new girlfriend, and really enjoys life. Today during the conversation with his doctor he was really freaked about the side effects of chemo and radiation... especially the chance that the radiation may cause impotency. Moreover, he's concerned that the colostomy will be permanent, and is pretty grossed-out by that.  

When last I spoke with him, he was considering foregoing any treatment, or seeking alternative therapies (read: bullshit therapies). I have told him that he should follow his doctor's recommendation, but I'm worried that the treatment will be terrible and may not work, and that the last few years he has left will ones of pain and discomfort. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Is the impotence permanent? Is the colostomy bag as bad as it seems?

Chemotherapy is not a curative treatment in this setting.  It could buy him some more time but he will eventually end up in a similar position with untreatable cancer that causes repeated fluid build up in the abdomen.  Chemotherapy would also cause a reduction in quality of life during treatment and potentially in the longer term.

My take on it is that he has refused chemotherapy to avoid toxicity but wishes to have the procedure for comfort.

I am his 35 yo daughter. Due to his housing circumstances, I offered for him to come stay with my husband and I until he passes. He is unable to get himself to Doctor appointments. He's been recommended for hospice care, but here's where I hit a snag. He keeps requesting the procedures to get the fluid removed from his belly and lungs. The hospice company available to him does not do these procedures. He is requesting them within a week of having the last one done. And as long as he keeps making these appointments, we can't get hospice to come in and care for him the way they need to.

Kind of a long rant, but there is a question. Can someone explain to me why a person would decide to not go through chemo treatments (which I can fully understand) but then decide that other types of invasive medical procedures are acceptable. He's a very frustrating man sometimes, and daily I just want to slap him. But I know it's not his fault, and it's just my anger at the situation of losing my father coming through.

I'm not going to tell you it's pleasant, but I will say that it makes me feel better. When I'm on chemo, I have a horrible day (8 hours of poison) followed by two really shitty days (2 days of a pump) followed by 3-4 days of being goddamn miserable (side effects of 3 straight days of poison), but then I get a week of feeling mostly normal, or at least close to it. When I'm on chemo, every other week is mine to do with as I please. 

I've taken a few breaks from chemo over the 2 1/2 years that I've been doing it. It's nice for a couple weeks. Then something goes wrong. It doesn't get better. Then something else goes wrong. Then I end up in the hospital for something stupid. After the residual effects of the chemo wear off, every day is a bad day, and every day gets worse.

It's at least worth a shot. My chemo is 100% palliative, no curative intent whatsoever, yet I'm more than happy to continue it. It's not even really working...my numbers aren't going up as fast as they do off of chemo, but they surely aren't going down. It makes me feel better, which is the whole point. It's also extending my life, as an bonus side effect.

I guess I need to vent/ask for guidance. 33 days ago my mother was diagnosed with stage 4b cervical cancer. Initially we were told without treatment she would have a year. With treatment she could possibly have 5. As in, 15% of stage 4b cervical cancer patients make it 5 years after their diagnosis.

We went for her pet scan on the 22nd of June, the radiation doctor said there were two lymph nodes that were causing some concern but not much but they decided they were switching from 5 weeks of radiation to 3 rounds of chemo, 1 round every 21 days. She met with her chemotherapy doctor and he informed her that they didn't want to blast her with the results of the pet scan until he was able to personally look at them (he had been out of town). There are 19 different lymph nodes that have been affected, they're across her chest, abdomen, and down her side. They gave us the estimated time of 17 months. It sucked a lot, and people respond different to treatment so we were still hopeful. Two days later they put her port in and noticed her creatinine levels were dangerously high. We took her to her urologist that night and she's been in the hospital ever since. I came down with a sinus infection and of course was barred from seeing my mother. This Tuesday I was able to visit her and she was better, they changed her medicines (and boosted her magnesium and potassium) and got her levels back down and she was acting completely normal, like prediagnosis normal. They took her off a liquid diet and allowed her to eat regular food. She got sick shortly thereafter... and started bleeding profusely to the point they were talking about blood transfusions. After some thinking and poking and proding they've discovered the cancer has moved to her colon and that it is intwined in her intestines causing her to become septic. They said they'd have to do surgery to try and remove some of the tumors and give her a colostomy bag.. and it would only give her possibly 6-12 months. Without surgery or treatment she has two weeks. My entire world has just exploded.

Today she has decided she wants no more testing, no more surgeries, basically no more treatment. I'm working and haven't made it up there yet and I don't even know what to say. My boss has expressed extreme distaste for what is going on by telling the other girl he doesn't know why I haven't returned to work since there's nothing I can do for my mom anyway... I only took 8 days off... I've been back at work 2 weeks after her diagnosis and now I feel like I had no business even coming back.

I want to be so selfish. But this is a time where she's allowed to be selfish, she's allowed to make whatever decision she feels is best for her. My mom had no symptoms that I knew of, she said she would have pain surges that would last seconds and she assumed it was gas. She isn't one to complain either way.

I want to change her mind, I want her to fight. But that is incredibly selfish of me. I'm not speaking with my siblings, while they're 22 and 24 years older than I am. My sister calls and argues with my mom to the point she is hysterical and she has even started harassing my mother's bed mate at the time! My brother visited twice since this has started and it was for a total of 40 minutes, my sister hasn't visited once. I'm 23. I'm 100% clueless. I don't know what to do.

We went for her pet scan on the 22nd of June, the radiation doctor said there were two lymph nodes that were causing some concern but not much but they decided they were switching from 5 weeks of radiation to 3 rounds of chemo, 1 round every 21 days. She met with her chemotherapy doctor and he informed her that they didn't want to blast her with the results of the pet scan until he was able to personally look at them (he had been out of town). There are 19 different lymph nodes that have been affected, they're across her chest, abdomen, and down her side. They gave us the estimated time of 17 months. It sucked a lot, and people respond different to treatment so we were still hopeful. Two days later they put her port in and noticed her creatinine levels were dangerously high. We took her to her urologist that night and she's been in the hospital ever since. I came down with a sinus infection and of course was barred from seeing my mother. This Tuesday I was able to visit her and she was better, they changed her medicines (and boosted her magnesium and potassium) and got her levels back down and she was acting completely normal, like prediagnosis normal. They took her off a liquid diet and allowed her to eat regular food. She got sick shortly thereafter... and started bleeding profusely to the point they were talking about blood transfusions. After some thinking and poking and proding they've discovered the cancer has moved to her colon and that it is intwined in her intestines causing her to become septic. They said they'd have to do surgery to try and remove some of the tumors and give her a colostomy bag.. and it would only give her possibly 6-12 months. Without surgery or treatment she has two weeks. My entire world has just exploded.

Today she has decided she wants no more testing, no more surgeries, basically no more treatment. I'm working and haven't made it up there yet and I don't even know what to say. My boss has expressed extreme distaste for what is going on by telling the other girl he doesn't know why I haven't returned to work since there's nothing I can do for my mom anyway... I only took 8 days off... I've been back at work 2 weeks after her diagnosis and now I feel like I had no business even coming back.

I want to be so selfish. But this is a time where she's allowed to be selfish, she's allowed to make whatever decision she feels is best for her. My mom had no symptoms that I knew of, she said she would have pain surges that would last seconds and she assumed it was gas. She isn't one to complain either way.

I want to change her mind, I want her to fight. But that is incredibly selfish of me. I'm not speaking with my siblings, while they're 22 and 24 years older than I am. My sister calls and argues with my mom to the point she is hysterical and she has even started harassing my mother's bed mate at the time! My brother visited twice since this has started and it was for a total of 40 minutes, my sister hasn't visited once. I'm 23. I'm 100% clueless. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to change her mind. I don't know if changing her mind is what is best for her."

DrEagerBeaver,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3dfc1q,2,ct57hs2,"Firstly, my best wishes to your family and your mother through this difficult time. Secondly, I wanted to respond because leptomeningeal spread is a difficult topic for patients and their families to attempt to research or understand, as there isn't a large amount of information available.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is relatively rare and occurs in around 5% of people with metastatic disease, most commonly when patients have breast, lung or colon cancer, or melanoma. It occurs when cancer cells get between two of the coverings of the brain - these tumours will not resolve completely even with treatment, and they will eventually grow and increase in number throughout the whole brain.

We generally put people with leptomeningeal spread into two groups depending on their prognosis, and this allows us to make a decision about the risks and benefits of pursuing treatment. 

Patients with poorer prognoses tend to be managed with palliative symptom control and preservation of existing quality-of-life for as long as possible. 

When patients have a better short-term prognosis and wish to pursue treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try and shrink the size of the tumours around the brain may help restore some quality of life - the methods you have mentioned are two ways of doing this. 

Prognosis is highly variable among patients such as your mother and I would encourage you to ask all the questions you have when you see her oncologist, either informally or in the context of a family meeting.",t3_3dfc1q,t1_ct57hs2,2015-07-16 10:30:44,,,Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (cancer in spinal fluid),"Does anyone have any experience with this?

hustle-x-rose,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_ct6po0w,2,ct6wsl3,"They said they want to do the radiation to the brain since this type of cancer spreads quickly to the brain so its for preventative measures. Which sounds kind of bull to me. Radiation to his chest because I guess when they respond well to the chemo the radiation helps make more room in the esophagus for food to go down. They are also doing radiation to a part of his spine/hip area where he gets the most pain from the cancer that spread to his bones.  He really isn't looking forward to it because its everyday for about 30 minutes for 2 weeks. He hates having appointments. 

I was actually very shocked with the difference from the Chemo. I was expecting him to go quickly (by the end of April) and now they have approved him being able to go to the mountains in September. He still only has weeks-months left but it shocked me to see the difference in the scan. 

He seems to have taken to chemo well, hasn't really made him sick. His hair thinned a lot so we shaved his head and beard. The steroids they give him during the first week keeps him wired all day and night, as long as he keeps up on his medication he doesn't get nauseated or sick. He has gained about 14 pounds so they like that. 
His 5th round of Chemo was rough for the first day but that was strange. He puked twice before even starting the chemo and then continued to be sick the whole day and night but fine the next morning, so I just figured it was bad food or something. He also got pneumonia between rounds 3 &amp; 4 which made me think it was the end but they loaded him up with antibiotics and he was fine. 

He gets the Neulasta shot after every treatment and that's really the only thing that gives him trouble. 4 days after getting it his whole body aches and tingles really bad. 

He would sleep all day everyday after the first week since he would be all done taking the steroids. Constantly sleeping and upset that he is wasting his time sleeping. The palliative care team decided to give him some Ritalin to keep his energy up and he is insanely high energy now. It's good but soooooo draining for everyone around him.

I've been trying to sleep at the hospital, haven't left since I took her there Tuesday until now.  I'm not far from the hospital but I had to leave.  When all her visitors leave and her medicine has put her to sleep, all I can do is watch her struggle for breath.  I cry most of the night and cannot get myself to sleep. Last time I slept was Sunday into Monday.  I only now left and feel VERY guilty. I'm only 13 minutes from the hospital so I thought I'd try to sleep here for an hour but still can't sleep because I feel guilty that she'll wake up and be alone or that she will pass and no one will be there with her.  I've been gone an hour already, is that too long?  I don't know how to end this other than saying I'm so confused about everything right now, I do not know what to do.



Update: She's coming home today. I'm waiting for hospice to get here to get everything setup. The doctor told me this morning that she's very close to the end. I'm still processing what he said even tho I knew it was close. I think I'll feel a little better once she's home where she wants to be.

Lostinparadise2,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3frian,3,ctr9efg,"Not me, but a family friend. She is not as far down the track as your husband, she is only just diagnosed. She is now four cycles into a chemo regimen that is administered each fortnight. It's been rough, she was quite ill after last round. The prognosis is not great for stage 4 bowel cancer, from what I understand most things are palliative (aimed at reducing pain) not curative (eg. there is no final fix). This includes surgery, chemo and radiation. But what is made worse in your situation is that your oncologist is not providing the kind of info you need, when you need it. I sense that you feel a bit powerless due to this lack of info, especially given the effort you are making for short visits (1.5hr trip for 15 min). Also because you are making this effort to ask/educate yourself, but not always being respected for it. This is kind of a doctor-patient issue that needs to be either resolved, or if possible perhaps a new doctor found. Last time my friend travelled to an oncologist appt (also a 1.5 hr drive), she was confronted with a 2.5 hour wait. She got into her car, drove home and emailed him instead. It's just not fair to make seriously ill people wait for that long after a long trip. At the same time, the onc has a list a mile long and only one day in that town to see those patients. It's hard. Sorry I can't provide anything more concrete or comforting than this - one last thing is that you shouldn't underestimate how hard all this is on you, too, as the caregiver.

Two years ago, on July 29 2013, he had life saving surgery to remove a tumor obstructing his bowels. They removed most of his large intestine and 21 lymph nodes. 2 of the lymph nodes were positive. 

After surgery, he went through 7 months of chemo 5FU. 
In March, his MRI had a suspicious growth. His PET lit up on a lymph node adjacent to his aorta. 

On July 14, 2015 he had major surgery. They removed 8 lymph nodes, surrounding soft tissue and a lesion off his liver. 
All if it had positive margins. (The lesion on his liver didn't show on the PET and was quite small.) 

His CEA after the first surgery was 3.7. It remained there, plus or minus .1 throughout chemo. It started crawling up this year and was 4.5 right before surgery. 
It is now only 2.9! 

We are meeting his specialist oncologist on the 18th of August to discuss next steps. 

I have repeated asked for the recommended treatment options before that appointment, so I can be prepared for it. I have asked for all known side effects and potential damage to be provided. It's a 1.5 hour drive each way for the 15 minute conversation with the oncologist. 

My question for redditors is: What should we expect next? 

In the past, I've seen a few contributors with Stage IV colon cancer. I try to remind my husband and his extensive family that he is LIVING with cancer, not dying from cancer. 

I know the chances for recurrence is very high, especially in the area next to his aorta. At least one oncologist of the tumor board is recommending radiation to that area. My research says radiation  can cause serious, permanent damage to his bowels. 

So far, not one doctor has brought up prognosis. My research is FAR from reassuring. In fact, there's not much available online once you've reached Stage 4. All the information about prevention and colonoscopies doesn't help when you are Stage 3 at 40 years old and Stage IV at 42. 

I'm doing my absolute best to be a good caregiver and patient advocate. Sometimes the doctors appreciate it. Sometimes they look at me like I crawled out from under their shoe. Asking hard questions about quality of life do NOT seem appreciated... 

Anyone out there fighting colon cancer at Stage 3 or higher, PLEASE chime in! Vent. Tell me your story. Tell me what treatment has been like. Tell me your prognosis. Give me advice on being a better caregiver and wife. 

Help, reddit! You're my only hope....

My mother was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma, with the primary source unknown, but suggested to be either Lung or Pancreas. Needless to say we were shocked, as she just went into the E.R with back and leg pain and we get this. Fuck cancer..

Several weeks later she had next to no appetite. Which was VERY concerning for me to say the least. My sister is a palliative care nurse and suggested Marinol. 

I can tell you that the very day my mother started Marinol she got her appetite back. She asked me to go to the store and get her Kraft Mac-n-cheese (In true stoner style). But seriously, her Nausea from the Narcotics and tumors in stomach was pretty bad, and Marinol really helped.

I am not a MJ smoker, never have been. Tried it, but it made me paranoid as hell. However, I can attest to this stuff working, at least for my mother.

Throughout this process I have found that my mothers PCP is very hesitant to prescribe drugs like Marinol where the Oncologists are happy to do it. So you may need to go that route.

The doctor said she's not ""looking good"".
This is very worrying for my family and I think they're even becoming a bit desperate. She's currently on a Dilaudid pump and I think it's not really helping her out that much. 
I am wondering the possibility of MMJ or Marinol-since my family may find the prospect of MMJ weird, they may be open to trying marinol-I wonder if it would be helpful in her case with pain/appetite loss resulting in massive weight loss. If Marinol is too mild, I could open the possibility of MMJ, but my family has no clue about marijuana, what would suit her or anything about smoking/edibles. So I'd need to know how to go about the process if they do consider it. We're in NorCal btw.

As far as discussions of hospice and palliative care versus further treatment, I think that there is unfortunately a time where you just need to be honest about your opinion. Again, be gentle. ""I believe that further chemotherapy won't benefit you, and might even hasten the end of your life. I think the best thing would be for you to be comfortable during this time and enjoy the rest of your life at home, with your friends and family. We'll do absolutely everything we can to make sure you aren't in pain and can make these last few (days, weeks, months) with your loved ones meaningful instead of being so sick from more chemo."" Also, it might be a great idea to have a hospice representative on stand-by, so to speak, to help you fill in the gaps. They are trained for this and are very good at speaking to people in a compassionate way.

So, sorry for the book - I hope it helped. 

Here's a TL;DR: Be compassionate, be gentle, ask the patient what kind of information they need, try to adjust your speech to their level of comprehension (which may change after they're out of diagnosis fog), and don't think you have to do it alone - other professionals  from palliative care/hospice can and will likely be able to help!",t3_3hjclw,,2015-08-19 11:15:13,,,what do you wish your doctor had said or done or what did they do well?,"I have always struggled to break bad news or counsel people on prognosis when it comes to cancer.  I've had patients get really mad because I said too much and they got offended at the mention of a poor prognosis, and then some patients who seem to really want more information.  I've read studies that say over 90% of patients want their doctor to discuss prognosis with them.  When someone has failed multiple chemotherapy regimens, I hate to sound pessimistic about treatment, or bring up hospice, even when the writing is on the wall because I don't want the family to ""give up hope"" if there is any hope left at that point.  Sometimes I know that the cost of care is exorbitant and most likely is futile but I just don't want to say it.  I also feel terrible when patients die in the hospital hooked up to lines and tubes in that last effort to treat the cancer, when studies have shown most people want to die at home.

The disease has spread to his spine, fractured his vertebrae and his humerus, caused him to lose 100 pounds, all interest in food and become completely bedridden. He uses a bedpan and handheld urinal. He requires IV fluids three times a week to avoid extreme dehydration. He often becomes hypercalcemic and experiences hallucinations, confusion and extreme fatigue. His quality of life is close to nothing. He lays in bed all day, too exhausted and weak and confused to even focus on a TV show. 

Hospice has been suggested to us several times, and stopping his oral chemo which may allievate some of his more uncomfortable symptoms. Yesterday, he was admitted to the hospital again with vomiting and a heart rate of 140 and fluid in his lungs. At the hospital he was asked to confirm his DNR status and he replied ""NO. I want to live. Full code."" He does not want home hospice. 

I worry that he is going through hell for no reason, as it is clear there is no pathway to a cure or even temporary relief for him. Of course, it is always going to ultimately be his choice. But I can't help but worry that since his time is short, we should focus on the quality of his time. I think his anxiety about death may be preventing him from accepting that...

sospeso,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3qedqi,6,cwel6wy,"Hi, there. So sorry to hear you're dealing with all this. 

I can't speak to your questions about colon cancer, but I can address your question about why treatment is considered palliative and not curative. I'm not an expert by any means, but both of my parents have been diagnosed with stage IV cancers (breast and lung, respectively), so I've picked up a bit along the way. As you probably know, the stages are determined by how extensively parts of the body other than the original site of the cancer are affected. So, if the cancer was limited to just the colon, that'd likely be stage I or stage II (depending on the details... it varies a bit for each type of cancer). Since your mom's cancer has mets in the liver and lungs (far from the original site, the colon), it's considered stage IV. 

At that point, because of the nature of cancerous cells, it is virtually impossible to remove all trace of the cancer from her body. Even if, for example, they were able to remove all cancerous masses, the thinking is that the cancer had to ""travel"" to get to these other locations, so there are likely cancerous cells in the lymphatic system, or the circulatory system, or whatever. So, the goal changes from ""curing"" - entirely eradicating the cancer from the body - to ""treating."" I don't know the details of your mother's condition, but I can say, that all this doesn't mean they won't find effective treatment that works for some time! My father was diagnosed with stage IV cancer several years ago, and the 5-year survival rate (meaning, how many people with his specific kind of cancer and mets would still be alive 5 years out) was dismal. Like, less than 10%. And he's still here. Thank goodness. So, I guess I wouldn't get too caught up in the language. Instead, I'd focus on evaluating the treatment options, and how well those fit in with what your mom would like to do.

I'll be thinking of you.

Also, some questions about trying to cure her incurable disease (rather than treat it, only).","As the title says, my mother is fighting this awful form of cancer. 



There's something that went awry during the first surgery she had (removing as much of the cancerous mass as possible in her colon); some of the cancer cells spilled into her pelvis area. They were unable to remove it, and the doctor is worried about where it might result in these cells growing into more cancerous mounds elsewhere.


Where could it travel to, from her pelvis? Like, could it attach to bone or some such? I'd appreciate some clarification if anyone can help enlighten me...


Also, her cancer was deemed incurable but treatable. Does that basically mean that the goal will always be keeping it in remission? What is the reason for them being unable to remove all of the offending cells? If it's in her colon and if it can't be removed, are there alternatives that would make it curable (and not just treatable) if she recieved a partial colon transplant from me? If that sort of thing is possible.

And as for her liver, as I understand it, I can donate up to half of mine and it would function for the both of us.

Are there any options we could take to actually cure this?

I am willing to donate anything and everything my mother needs.

But in her current state, she can't. I mean, she can't even take care of herself. She would be so more comfortable with the great pain management and general helpfulness of at home care. I just wish I could help her be more comfortable.

Advice would be good, but this is mostly for getting some stuff off my chest. Thanks for reading."
RenLibrarian,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_cwlu8kh,3,cwlxp96,"Thank you for replying. After reading as much as I can, I agree it sounds like extensive stage. It's driving me crazy that she just flat out says her doctor didn't stage her. SO the only thing that I can think of is that her doctor DID stage her as ""extensive"" and explained what that means but she is in hardcore denial. Or, which seems less likely, her doctor did not do a good job explaining to her what her results indicate...that chemotherapy is pretty much palliative at this point. Although her prognosis is bleak, I, albeit selfishly, feel better knowing the facts. I'm just going to do what I can to make every moment I have left with her count and make sure she's as comfortable as possible. ",t3_3r8caf,,2015-11-02 19:38:31,,,,
claireklur,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3ruxlw,2,cwrly60,"Hi,
My dad is 58 and is going through the same thing. He has secondary on adrenal glands and skeletal muscles. He was diagnosed with advanced oesophagus cancer in july, and 3 days ago he was hospitalised and I dont think he will be coming out. He only was given palliative chemo treatment, and was just on his second month when he was hospitalised. he was very strong and determined but very much in denial this was not the end for him. However, I spoke to him last night and he said he doesn't want to do the chemo no more, and heart breakingly said he hopes he has a heart-attack so its over much quicker. I'm sorry I don't have no comforting words but I think both our parents being so young its so much more aggressive and the survival rates are well... non existent. My dad has gone from (UK weights sorry) 12 stone in july to 7 stone 3 pounds as of last week. he is on steriods and its not helped.

I really hope yours is not as advanced and hopefully there is a better outcome.",t3_3ruxlw,,2015-11-07 07:07:49,,,I(23F) just found out that my mom(56F) has esophageal cancer. I don't know what to do,[removed]
Zanpie,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3ry9un,1,cwsjwqd,"I was 26 when my Mom (59 at the time) was diagnosed with stage II NSCLC. At that time I was living in the UK, while she was back in West Canada. 
I hope, things go better for you than they have for us. I was finishing my MA in the UK and would be back home for the summer before starting a teaching position in Toronto. She went through the gauntlet, radiation, chemo etc. When I returned home, my sister and I were informed that the treatments had not worked and she was now stage IV NSCLC, with 9 tumors on her spine. 

At that point it became about quality of life rather than a potential for a cure. She never wanted to stand in the way of me going forward in life and urged me to go to Toronto to teach AHIS101. 

About 3 months into teaching, I got a call from her saying that it had progressed further and was now on her femur and intestines, also that her lung was filling with fluid which was causing her enormous respiratory problems. 

So I said FUCK IT. Quit my job and went home. Mom got put on **erlotinib** (PLEASE ask your doctor about this drug). It has horrendous side affects like pealing skin, digestive tract issues etc. etc. and only works on 10-15% of NSCLC patients as the cancer has to be caused by a mutation of a specific chromosome.

It gave my Mom another year. This September, as was expected the drug stopped working. She is now in the end of life stage and is on palliative care at home, and sometimes has to go into hospice to increase her pain medication. 

She is on oxygen full time and is greatly fatigued.

Emotionally, for you - I cannot say. We each deal with these horrors differently. I fell hard back into my Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder - and had a mental break causing what are known as 'Borderline Personality Disorder Traits'. 


You will need counseling - but make sure they are a good fit. Nothing is worse than a bad councilor at such a transformative time. 

Ere on the side of caution when considering discussing past trauma's or unresolved issues of the past with your Mother or any member of your family. When people are in crisis, to a certain extent we all become selfish. 

Friends, *sigh*, well, this is one of those times when you get to find out if they will be there for you or not. Don't be surprised if many are not. People are just people - they don't know what to do. Try not to get angry or upset. And sorry that I'm rather doom and gloom over here, but just know that people will let you down; more poignantly you will let yourself down. 


Try not to end up like I was for over a year. Riddled with disdain for my Sister and Father - and all my friends for not being their enough. Then angry at myself for not trying hard enough for my Mom as well. 

When, and hopefully she doesn't, but when she reaches stage IV, I would go home no mater what. 

Help with cooking and cleaning - bringing in fresh flowers. Watch TV in bed together (we're watching Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell), or I'll read to her. 


I try to keep myself occupied while she is in hospice or sleeping by looking forward past the end - and have contacted the PhD program I'd like to start next fall. Then I study. 


I'm very sorry. I don't have anything more. Except maybe, that one of the hardest things is how quickly they age. My Mom, still a golden haired beauty at 59 has now shrunken 4 inches due to scoliosis, and has short grey hair. Her face has aged 20 years, and (again this is end of life symptom), but her legs, feet, face and neck have all swollen. 


Just try to be kind to yourself. Crying is okay, sobbing and howling is okay. Having 'I can't move because I'm too sad' days is okay. You're okay. You'll be okay. 


Right now, at the close of this I am unsure if I am talking to you or to myself.

I got the sense from the doctors that ""it's gone to the liver, and we really didn't want this to happen, this is the last chance"". It's really, really scary. 

Like you I kept obsessing over last occasions, like birthdays and especially Christmas. I even thought of things like ""Will she be there to see me get married? Will she know my kids?"" and it's awful and all consuming. 

The only thing I can offer is that I've found it's no good to think like this. It's not helpful, and although it may be true, thinking about it all the time is not good for your well being. It's better to try and take things day by day, enjoy the time you have. It's easier said than done. I'm fortunate in that my mum is incredibly strong and doesn't worry about the future, so that makes it somewhat easier. Saying that, it's been a year now and I still mind myself breaking down and crying every couple of weeks.

After reading clinical research into high dose vitamin C (intravenous) we asked his oncologist.  Some cancers, according to the research, responded well to IV vit C where others responded very badly.  Anyway, this experienced, well-respected oncologist looked shocked when we asked.  He very strongly advised we absolutely did not go down that route, and even wrote to husband's GP saying the same.  I personally wouldn't try a therapy without robust clinical research supporting it, assuming that it's looking like a treatment which needs more research or funding approval - I believe there is an immunotherapy drug currently approved in the US but not yet approved by the NHS.  If it doesn't get NHS approval we will certainly look at private purchase if the time comes (it's when nothing else will work and gains the patient an average of an extra 3 months).

Bear in mind that a lot of countries have social healthcare with a vested interest in protecting it's citizens.  Trials are not just funded by 'big pharma', governments and social groups/charities fund them too, plus there is definitely money to be made out of administering the drugs you list.

Has she told the oncologist about her recent pains as well?

Even if there's minimal improvement, every step forward is a victory. Every good day she has is a victory. Every additional moment she can enjoy with you and your children is a victory. Even though that fear will always be in the back of your mind, definitely don't disregard the little things and learn to celebrate them with her. I think that support from you, and perhaps a bit of that shift in mind set will go a long way in terms of emotional support for each other.

I'm new to this site but wanted to see if there was a way I can find out what others have been through and how to best deal with it.

In June this year my wife and I were informed that she had cancer of the bowel and also extensive shadows on her liver but would know more after a colonoscopy. This followed and results confirmed that she had metastatic colorectal cancer (stage 4). The news was like a bomb had gone off - absolutely devastated to say the least.

The doctor asked if we had suspected this news. Why on earth would we suspect that? I mean, my wife had been violently sick (wretching for weeks and losing weight) but just put it down to a bad virus or something. Reading up on it now, symptoms arise when its at the advanced stage.

I spoke to oncologist on my own as my wife didnt want to know too much. He said that due to the extent of cancer on her liver (in 6 places and covering half of her liver) it cant be operated on at all due to there not being enough healthy liver left to rebuild itself and where the tumours are on the liver. The only route we can go down is palliative and involved chemotherapy. I also asked the prognosis and informed me it was likely to be 18-24 months due to the metastasis of the liver. A life I can't comprehend bringing up my two children without their mother who is only in her early 30's. To make it worse I was also told that our two young children would likely to have 'the gene' also but tried to put my mind at ease by saying they would bring them forward for tests for cervical, prostate etc at the earliest opportunity. So ive got it all to go through again later on.

I have tried to discuss things with her but think she thinks im just being negative and all her friends are saying she can beat this and she is a fighter and everything will be okay. Just feels like I cant win. Im really struggling to accept any of this and just want to crawl in a hole away from everyone and everything. Something I know I can't do as I work full time and have two young children. I love her so much and feel so, so helpless that I cant do anything to rid her of this retchid disease. I'm her husband and is my job to protect her and I can't even do that.

I've even visited Macmillan and briefly spoken to them but just can't open up properly with them. They did offer to meet up with families in similar circumstances but I just don't want to and in fact, can't.  I just can't. 

She has now finished 5 months of chemotherapy (Folfiri) and to start with she had very minor side effects apart from mouth ulcers, odd sickness feeling in morning and lots of tiredness the few days after chemo session. She thought chemo was a breeze but is now finding it harder and harder. She is full of the cold at the moment which has caused her to miss a couple of chemo sessions and is really suffering from fatique at the moment and not eating anywhere near as much as she normally does. Having said that she is still drinking fizzy energy drinks / pop, sweets, chocolate and cakes. Cant really take them away from her as what else would she have? Everything else has been taken away from her. I know...I have heard all about the sugar feeds cancer stories but what can I do?

She's had a ct scan in september and was told that there was partial response and nothing showing in the bowel area and some shrinkage in the liver tumours. She said she planned to celebrate with her friends and later accused me of not being happy about the news. I was happy that it has shrunk the tumour a bit but the fact is, she stll has metastatic colorectal cancer and it can't be cured - our oncologist has twice told me this now. It's almost like shes been told she is cured and the cancer has completely gone. I have to try and stay focused and keep some realism to the situation as I know cancer can do so much damage and change very quickly. Does that make me a bad person?

Can the cancer go from partial response to start growing again through next phase of chemo? Is it still too early to tell if everything is going to plan? She has recently had pain in her hip and liver pains have resurfaced again occasionally. Is this a bad thing?

Has anyone else been in similar situation or any advice which would be greatly appreciated. Thankyou and sorry for going on a bit. Just feel a bit lost at the moment :-("
AquaAzureAegean,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3vinxx,1,cxnx383,"I haven't direct experience of breast cancer but I can tell you what I have been told.

Not all breast cancer is genetic.  That may explain why none of your other relatives have suffered.

I can see no reason why a double mastectomy would have any impact at all on your fertility.  I know if you have breast reconstruction after, you need to have the implants replaced about every 10 years so scarring would be a consequence.  I don't know if nipples are removed in this sort of case, but if not, there's the risk of losing them anyway and losing any sensitivity even if you do get to keep them.
Recently a palliative care consultant did an AMA on r/science and I specifically asked them 'are stage iv cancer patients ever cured'.  Their answer is yes, the chances of which depend on the type of cancer, but yes.

As for the genetic element, one of my closest friends lost her mother to genetic ovarian cancer - BRCA gene so can manifest as breast or ovarian.  She was genetically tested and part of the process in the UK is counselling so you understand what the results mean.  She was told that having the gene **did not** mean she would definitely get the cancer, instead she was told lifestyle had a greater impact.  Think of the saying 'the straw that breaks the camel's back' - well she was told if she had the BRCA gene, her camel would already have half a load so good lifestyle choices would be equally important.  She tested negative, as did her sister.  However, the counsellor was quite firm that this didn't mean she wouldn't get breast/ovarian anyway, good lifestyle and vigilance were also important.

Losing your mum can have an enormous impact on you.  You sound like you've been left with a very large fear.  Perhaps you might consider some counselling to help you put this particular fear into some perspective?  I'm not sure why you think breast cancer is the 2nd most lethal.  [Here](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-survival-by-stage) are the survival stats according to the American Cancer Society and they look a lot better than a lot of other cancers.  Counselling might help you stop worrying about this.

So I have a few questions involving breast cancer and the genetics that play a heavy part in it. For reference: My mom died of breast cancer, and I am 19. I guess I am preparing myself.

Now then:
1. If my mother had breast cancer, does it mean my chances are DEFINITELY increased? Even if I don't have the gene?

2. My mother has three sisters who are all alive - along with my grandmother. None of them have ever been diagnosed. Is it possible that the gene skipped all of those women and made it's way to her?

3. My mother was very overweight - how does this effect breast cancer?

Some other stuff:
1. How much does a double mastectomy decrease your chances of cancer by? And if you already have cancer that hasn't spread - can it remove the cancer completely?

2. Does a double mastectomy effect your chances of having children?

3. What are some consequences of a double mastectomy? My fear of cancer is positively gargantuan and I literally hate boobs. Like, hate them. So I don't think I would be psychologically effected. I'm asking for physical consequences.

4. Is all stage IV cancer terminal? Can you be cured?

5. Is it possible to have stage IV cancer with NO symptoms other than a lump?

6. And, finally, why is breast cancer so damn deadly? Doesn't it receive more funding than any other cancer but is the second most lethal?

beamseyeview,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_3vgcwd,1,cxozxh0,"I'm just going to focus on the cancer questions but I'm glad you're getting some support in the other comments. I think the psychosocial aspect of dealing with this is certainly going to be the toughest part for the whole family.  I do hope you visit with the palliative team again.

 Everything is going according to plan.  She started on FOLFIRI and had a partial response. There is no reason to suspect or worry that it is growing now.  It sounds like finding reasons to celebrate is an important part of the journey for your wife and I'd encourage you to support her in that. 

Chemo ""holidays"" are part of the usual course.  This chemo can be well tolerated but the side effects like fatigue can become very debilitating.  Coming off for some time helps.  Sometimes the cancer grows when there is no chemo (as expected), but as long as the symptoms aren't a problem that is ok.  There is no reason to suspect it won't respond to chemo once it is started again.

You're right of course - at some point this won't respond to the chemo, or she won't be able to have the chemo, but as you heard this can be two years down the line.  

You're not a bad person, you're trying to keep honest and focused, and you understand her disease well. The harder part will be understanding what she needs from you.

p.s. Sugar is fine, let her have whatever she likes.  This was an old and disproven theory based around the fact that cancer primarily takes up sugar, but it turns out that more or less dietary sugar won't impact development or progression of cancer.",t3_3vgcwd,,2015-12-06 10:29:11,,,My wife has metastatic colorectal cancer (advanced bowel cancer),"Hi everyone

I've even visited Macmillan and briefly spoken to them but just can't open up properly with them. They did offer to meet up with families in similar circumstances but I just don't want to and in fact, can't.  I just can't. 

She has now finished 5 months of chemotherapy (Folfiri) and to start with she had very minor side effects apart from mouth ulcers, odd sickness feeling in morning and lots of tiredness the few days after chemo session. She thought chemo was a breeze but is now finding it harder and harder. She is full of the cold at the moment which has caused her to miss a couple of chemo sessions and is really suffering from fatique at the moment and not eating anywhere near as much as she normally does. Having said that she is still drinking fizzy energy drinks / pop, sweets, chocolate and cakes. Cant really take them away from her as what else would she have? Everything else has been taken away from her. I know...I have heard all about the sugar feeds cancer stories but what can I do?

She's had a ct scan in september and was told that there was partial response and nothing showing in the bowel area and some shrinkage in the liver tumours. She said she planned to celebrate with her friends and later accused me of not being happy about the news. I was happy that it has shrunk the tumour a bit but the fact is, she stll has metastatic colorectal cancer and it can't be cured - our oncologist has twice told me this now. It's almost like shes been told she is cured and the cancer has completely gone. I have to try and stay focused and keep some realism to the situation as I know cancer can do so much damage and change very quickly. Does that make me a bad person?

Can the cancer go from partial response to start growing again through next phase of chemo? Is it still too early to tell if everything is going to plan? She has recently had pain in her hip and liver pains have resurfaced again occasionally. Is this a bad thing?

Has anyone else been in similar situation or any advice which would be greatly appreciated. Thankyou and sorry for going on a bit. Just feel a bit lost at the moment :-("

I think when they give you IV meds, they sedate you completely.  They promised I will not die in pain.  

 Also, if the liver is the source of the pain, they can inject the nerves around the liver with alcohol and kill them, ending the pain.  I don't know what this does to you otherwise. This is done in a hospital.  You may want to involve hospice/palliative care sooner than later to get some reassurance in these areas.

It was an incredibly stressful time. Looking back it feels like I was on some kind of drug.  I just wanted to say, don't be scared about her dying at home, or finding her dead, or being there when she passes. It's not pleasant, and it's a bit disturbing, but it's natural and a part of life that we will all face. Be strong and do your best, but also don't be too hard on yourself either.  My own mum died in an intensive care unit when I was 25 after a battle of about 2 weeks, but I couldn't be by her side when she passed - she was unconscious, and it was just too hard for me. Her partner was there for her.  My wife was semi-conscious when she passed, so it was hard. But I'm so glad I was there for her all the way.  A few other points.  Death can come on quite quickly, although you'll probably know a few days in advance.  Depending on where the cancer has spread, there will be different signs.  My wife slipped into mostly semi-conscious state a few weeks in advance, only waking to have a small drink or to use the toilet, or move to bed. Afterwards I found this obscure resource from Tasmania (I don't live there!) that helped explain things a little. http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/36940/Delirium_FINAL_130509.pdf
Palliative care helped with in-home hospice, providing equipment like walking frame and wheelchair, frame for the toilet, and a seat for the shower.  Make sure you quiz them about being prepared to provide pain management right up to the end.  Depending on where you live, you might also want to get ambulance membership/cover.  We called an ambulance in the end, and although they didn't take her to hospital, they provided some pain management (because our palliative care specialist had not been adequately prepared, not that the pain seemed that intense or lasted long, but it must vary from person to person).  Don't feel that you need to have any profound conversations or anything, unless she does - I'm sure just being there will be a great comfort to her.  Be strong, hang in there, and don't be hard on yourself. If you have a special friend you can open up to, go and spend some quality time with them to let some of your emotions out.

Our oncologist is of South Asian descent, so she knows there's some alternative medicine that's touted to help in palliative care, to shrink tumors, or even just act as a placebo effect to ease people's minds. When we asked about East Asian herbal remedies that had been suggested to us by family, the oncologist said ""there isn't enough research to back up the use of any of those. If someone was in end stages and couldn't be treated any further, I would consider it more, but cases where we have a method of treatment that we know works, we don't want any interference"". It can be helpful to those involved - instead of just waiting around, at least it's doing *something*. 

With that said, there are many alternative treatments that are pure quackery and can do more harm than good.

His oncologist understood my dad's need to fight and put him through some very aggressive chemo and radiation. Even when things looked dismal, the oncologist never gave us any indication that we were fighting a losing battle. The scans were obviously dismal (spread to bones, liver, lympthnodes) but the oncologist always had a treatment plan.

This week, however, when the cancer came back again and spread even further after a VERY short remission, the oncologist had ""the talk"" with my dad and gave him 6-9 months. Because my dad still wants to fight, the doctor is putting him on low dose chemo but it's more to contain the spread and hope for the best as far as I understand it.

So my question for anyone who has had loved ones be given a time frame, usually how accurate is it? I know no one can predict anything and life has a way of surprising things and there's always stories about people who beat the odds---but I just want to know how accurate doctors usually are with time frames."

While I agree with you that in an ideal world he could see this oncologists any time of day, 365, that may not change his management very much right now. The cornerstone of treatment for cancer related pain is medications like he is getting. It sounds like they did tests to make sure there was nothing more urgent or anything that needed surgery.  

I have worked at the Cross.  They are probably open for emergencies. These include people that are becoming paralyzed, can't breathe, or are having massive bleeding because of their cancer. Thankfully that is not him. Radiation is an effective treatment for pain, but it can take weeks to take effect, so starting now vs tomorrow is not essential - the cornerstone of management is medications like he is getting.  Anyway, he may not be in any shape today to lie still on the table for the time required.

The pain became manageable, and he's been living a normal life. I saw him on Christmas Eve, and you wouldn't know what happened. However, my grandma phoned this evening, and gave us terrible news. What I heard was spotty because my parents were in another room, but basiclly the pain became so bad on Christmas and boxing day, they had to call an ambulance. On top of that, the pain wasn't manageable until they used a drug more powerful than morphine. Now, in the title I mentioned a stupid policy. Well, the Cross Cancer society is closed for the holidays. They won't even take in new patients for emergencies. Now, my grandpa has to stay in the hospital till Tuesday when they open, and all the hospital can do is keep his pain down and respond to any medical emergencies. I know the staff there need time off, but shouldn't they take in emergencies? I don't like the thought of my grandpa lying there as the doctors don't know what the heck to do. They ran xrays he has no fractures, so all we can do is wait.


EDIT 1: We got a call from my aunt, but details from my dad are spotty so I apologize for the lack of detail. He got some tests done but we don't have the results yet, and he is going to the cross (maybe tomorrow my dad says) to get a bone scan. 

EDIT 2: If you're still reading this then you have my sincerest graduate. Right when I started this my grandma phoned and we (well, her and my dad) had a very good conversation. It turns out when they said he was tested, they meant everything: blood, xray, kidneys, etc. From that they know absolutely nothing, which is pretty frustrating. The ambulance came and brought my grandpa to the cross again today, and they ran him through an MRI, but they won't read it until Monday, which again is frustrating. Once they brought him back to the hospital they checked his pulse and it was too high. They were afraid it could be a heart attack or stroke, and it was serious enough to get him transfered straight to intensive care. They were going to give him a drug to deal with it, but a nurse tried some breathing strategy (I have no details and I apologize, I think she breathed in his mouth), and it brought his pulse back down to normal. The pain is in his back, and I honestly don't know what'll happen if the MRI doesn't turn something up. My parents are hoping to visit him tomorrow, and I want to come along, hopefully I can. 


EDIT 3: I honestly don't know if anyone is still reading this, but I want to tell someone. They read his MRI, and found cancer cells in his back. I visited him with my parents on Saturday, and it was just so sad. He was lying in a hospital bed with a tube in his nose, groggy from the meds and whatnot. While he was there he developed pneumonia, but it went away. Today they decided whether to try and deal with the pain and slow the cancer, or deal with the pain and let the cancer spread freely. My mom won't tell me until after school, so I'll update this when I know. If you are still reading this, thanks you, I truly appreciate it.

EDIT 4: I don't think anyone reading this, but I'll update anyway. His doctor talked with him, and they won't try to slow it down. Their only focus is relieving the pain enough that he can live at home with my grandma. Apparently he might not live till the end of the year. I don't know what else to say, but I don't for see updating this anymore. Thank you for your concern, and if you're still reading this then I appreciate it. "

ulysses_was_good,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_40fvqf,1,cyvufkp,"I don't know what it feels like to be religious. As you have had faith naturally since birth, I have had that in reverse. As a fellow human, I want you to know I feel no joy in hearing that you are going through really hard times on top of loss of faith. 

Despite unable to relate to your initial faith, I can understand fully the fear of ""so..what?"". My mom has stage 4 cancer and it's not going really well right now. I have asked myself every single question (existential and emotional and even stupid questions) and I still have no answer.

Fortunately for me, I have a partner who is a staunch realist. The first thing he told me when my mother was diagnosed and was told its going to palliative was ""Ulysses_was_good, everyone dies. Don't panic."" I know it's the most obvious thing, but I think most of us ""knows"" that everyone dies but it's not ""real"" to us until something like this happens. I'd say it feels like listening to a foreign language or hearing about a movie to then go to speaking the actual language / watching the actual movie and being touched by it.

I am around your age. We are young if you ask some, old if you ask others. I don't have a lot of wisdom to give but I can tell you how I cope (or try to cope). This is highly personal and i understand if you do not wish to listen. I am still not religious (&amp; highly analytical AND emotional) but I read simple book about the basic concepts of buddhism. Not as a religion, but as a philosophy. In the stories, Buddha the character was a prince with a beautiful wife and all that he wanted, but realized that despite all the wealth and love and power, he was still afraid of death. The desire to overcome the fear of death is what propelled him to leave his kingdom and search for wisdom.

I wish I could tell you that in this story, there is some strong evidence/conclusion that buddha got over his fears and gave this knowledge to everyone. That's not so. Instead, I have learnt tremendously through mindfulness. I don't tend to adhere to group mentality or any religious groups but this one phrase really helped: Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. Obviously a simplified, wisdom-lite version of an entire philosophy. Things happen. People get cancer, people lose jobs, they fall, they get back up. Some of us are lucky enough to access these kinds of forums and get support. others don't even have this option and suffer alone. 

I have, since the diagnosis, accepted a lot more than before that things that are out of my control will always be out of my control. To fixate on the ""why"" and ""why me"" is an option, to make the best of what we have/are given/ whatever you believe in is also an option.

In this giant world of 7 billion people where a lot of us feel so small and powerless, I chose to retake a bit of that power by choosing to be proactive no matter what happens.

Now the pain is still there. It's hard for me to watch any cancer-related stuff (which seems to be everywhere nowadays). I lost quite a few friends because I've ""gone inside myself"" and had trouble with the pitiful look I got from my friends. I have found new friends and courage here.

Sometimes I wake up and feel sad. Insecurity about the future scares all of us, including not knowing the time we have left/the person diagnosed have left. Religious or not religious, it is a human experience.

So welcome to the human experience. I dare assume that it will hurt, it will feel unfair, you will feel deep deep anger, guilt, regret. I wish you didn't have to. I wouldn't wish stuff like this to my worst ennemies. Yet, because we are human and we are fragile but because there is love and hope still, we will fight the fight. No matter what happens with you and your father, I hope you know that someone, some stranger online will have felt true empathy, kindness and hope for you.

A lot of the time I operate like normal. Sometimes I cry out of the blue. Sometimes I obsessively research it.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to process. I'd already planned a trip to see him this month due to an academic conference in my parents' city. I expect that visit to be mostly ""normal.""

I'm 27. My mom's dad didn't die until she was mid-fifties. It feels too early. I shouldn't lose someone this young.

Just...  does anyone have any words of wisdom? It's so private, I don't feel like I want to open up to most people I know in person.

Edited to add: This diagnosis was very recent, so when it was first found it was already Stage IV."

Since it was palliative from the start, I never had ""high hopes"" and for some reason i feel calm right now. But I know I am sad. I know I am angry too.
We will ask for a time prognosis (although i know its not an exact science) and try to be there for her as much as i can.

I could really use some advice and general niceness.

The lack of coverage and obstinance by the insurance company is disgusting. You alone are not likely to move these mountains but her doctor(s) can and should.

Re: pain medications, the more expensive extended release name brands (e.g. oxycontin) are typically last-resort, prior authorization required medications (for managed care/HMOs). Prior to approving these she may be asked to try short-acting opiods (or patches if she is unable to take pills) or a longer-acting extended release generic morphine. 

Does she have any pain medication at all? Her physician should be doing everything possible to palliate--including going to bat with insurance. It is absurd that she would be left with no pain management at the moment. 

As for the lack of chemo coverage, sometimes, with advanced stage cancer, the standard of care is palliative treatment (doing what they can to make her comfortable which may include chemo, radiation, or medication). Perhaps your mother has co-morbid conditions for which chemo is not recommended. Perhaps the doctor requested an off-label drug or one that has not shown enough efficacy for that type of cancer. No matter, if her doctor(s) think she's a good candidate, that should take precedence. They have the means to step in and help with the appeal. If the doctor is not willing/able to help, it's time to seek another, more compassionate physician if possible. Of course, that adds time and needless suffering, which is heartbreaking.

One last note is that your mom may be eligible for a clinical trial with the drug that isn't covered (or something similar). If her doctor doesn't know of any, you can search ClinicalTrials.gov for her type and stage of cancer. My oncologist didn't know of any trials for which I was eligible but I found one on the .gov website that was a perfect fit (and got into the arm that had the chemo drugs I wanted--including an off-label biologic agent that never would have been approved by insurance). Insurance companies are not required to cover the drug but they are required to cover the cost of ""routine patient care"". The chemo drugs are usually covered by the funding agency or pharmaceutical company. Here is more information about the insurance (including Medicare) requirements under the Affordable Care Act (http://www.asco.org/insurance-coverage-clinical-trial-participants).",t3_41p3h5,,2016-01-19 17:28:55,,,,

As /u/jessi74 suggested, I actually think that a referral to a hospice palliative medicine doc is a great idea even if you're very far from the end. Your oncologist or family doctor could help with that. They are experts in managing symptoms at all times and not just in the last days of months. Palliative medicine is just any treatment focused on relieving symptoms. It's also great to have a relationship with someone that knows you well if they need to tend to you when you're more sick.

Additionally, those doctors can reinforce that there is actually a lot that we can do to help with the sensation of breathlessness and cough if the chemo doesn't help. Depending on the situation, there may be a role for radiation or for one of many medications that decrease anxiety, the choking or coughing sensation, or swelling. It is common for people with breathing problems to worry about what it will be like in the future, but in my experience we've always been able to make things very comfortable even if the cause can't be reversed. If you're anxious about it though, I think the palliative care team would be a great one to share that with

ulysses_was_good,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_460tdw,5,d01ugy3,"Hey.
Big hug. My mother passed a week ago. It is hard to lose a parent. Incredibly difficult to go through or explain to thosr who has not experienced it. I also learnt about my moms cancer when it was already ""too late"". Here are a list of things that helped and that you can expect (my own personal opinion).
Helped:
1. Understanding truly that this can happen to anyone. I dont mean to sound cruel. But it does. Cancer is the disease of the century. Rich or poor, young or old.
2. Understanding the illness. Read about cancer. Find out about palliative care.
3. Reach out to people (which you are doing already).
4. Forget the past. Don't regret stuff thats in the past. Be expressive, tell your father how you feel, tell him you love him. 
5. Record your fathers voice, film videos, do stuff together.
Thats all i can think of right now.
What to expect(my own opinion. Feel free to disregard)
1. I felt a lot of anger. I felt like this isn't fair. That life isn't fair. Why my mom? There isn't an answer. Its okay to feel anger
2. Some guilt. I felt guilty about a lot of stuff i said in the past. Its normal.
3. Sadly, as your fathers conditions deteriorates, he might also get angry, sad, might want to isolate himself, etc... Please read up about what happens for people who has your dads prognosis. Try and be understanding.
4. I found myself working very hard at my art. It was a good distraction. If you have a hobby you find soothing, please do continue.

Also, feel free to contact me. I am willing to listen or whatever you want to talk about I'll converse.

A year ago he was biking centuries, now he can't walk 20 feet - the decline has been unreal. 

I've known he was going to die since this thing started back in July, but this is much sooner than I had expected. I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing or feeling here, I'm not really very in touch with my emotions on a good day... let alone right now.

Second, **Chemotherapy saves lives. Scientifically unsupported treatments kill people.**

Along with surgery and radiotherapy (and some other infrequently used but scientifically supported treatments that are similar), chemo's the only treatment method that works. I assume you're new here and don't quite understand the context of what this is about. 

If you have cancer, every day, some alternative medicine nutjob tells you to do a juice cleansing or some other such nonsense and that chemo is totally awful - as if chemo versus pink kool aid or the ridiculousness of the week is a choice between something like brussel sprouts and chocolate, where both things are on completely equal footing, when the reality is of course that one is scientifically supported, and works, and the other isn't and has only one outcome, a horrible death. That's what this is about. Someone is against chemo, something that works in favor of ???.

Unfortunately, some people are not well-educated on the matter, and believe this nonsense. They proceed to die, often quite painfully, from treatable cancers. Many cancers are highly treatable, btw. **Cancer is not a death sentence.** Despite the proponents of this anti-chemo insanity e.g. Jessica Ainscough dying (along with her mother Sharyn Ainscough who she murdered through her ignorance) of completely treatable cancers, people still support this crap. 

End-of-life planning is a different issue and has been talked about on here as well. Fwiw, there is also something called palliative chemotherapy (with lowered doses), which in some instances does actually measurably improve quality of life in persons considered terminal and extend their lives. It is not always appropriate, but in some cases is. Your father's scenario is not the only one.  Cancer is not one disease, but several and cure, treatment, survival, and end-of-life scenarios can differ markedly.

Some informations about her, Female, Age of 76, beginning Dementia, BMI round about 19, had a little stroke, COPD, Atritis, pretty strong edema in both legs.

They couldn't tell her what kind of cancer or if she has cancer. Because the lung is to weak for an operation and even for radiotherapy. So she decided that she doesn't want any therapy at all. Which I can fully understand and she has our full support.

The question is, what can we expect from now on? She has some pain in the lung at the moment Ibuprophen are ok for this. But we know it will get worse.

So basicly what what will happens next? I know without treatment you don't make it very long with lung cancer. Should we allready start with searching for a hospiece? She and we want for her to stay as long as possible at home. where her beloved are around, but we're not so unrealistic to say we are enable to walk the whole way without professionel help.

onaygem,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_d0c0639,3,d0c2dwu,"&gt;Interesting 30% growth in 3 month is ""slow"". I thought it's pretty fast.

I'm not experienced in lung cancer so I don't know the specifics of these tumors. However, from what I've seen (in other cancers), you are correct in thinking that this growth would probably be considered fast for most tumors, but this depends widely on the cancer.  
That said, I think the point that /u/ParkieDude was getting at is that a lack of metastasis (tumor cells spreading and forming new tumors) is generally a good sign, and indicates a longer survival.  
Still, without seeing a lot more information, nobody here can give you any reliable information on prognosis/diagnosis/treatment options.

The first thing you should probably consider is meeting with a doctor who specializes in lung cancer. They will have better knowledge of what your options are and what you should expect, and with a big diagnosis like this it is probably a good idea to have more than one opinion.

You might also want to meet with a palliative care specialist - a doctor who focuses on treating the symptoms of a disease more than curing the disease itself. They (and your cancer doctor) will be the best people to answer your questions, and meeting with them soon (before things get worse) will help them develop a plan moving forward.",t3_47by5l,,2016-02-24 16:24:25,,,,

I had chemo, liver surgery, then what was planned to be my colon surgery. There, my diagnosis changed: mets to the ovary and probably peritoneum too (which, as turned out later, they were right about). So they didn't do the surgery, and changed plans to a more intense treatment, but still curative. My surgery became much more extensive, followed by more chemo (which was the initial plan anyways) until December 11th (I still know the date).

Then beginning of February 2014, it turned out that my cancer was still there. And 4 weeks later, we saw that it was also very aggressive. It was scary. The doctor told me that he did not see a chance anymore that I would be cured for a long term.

So that's when we started palliative chemo. I have been on constant chemo since then (different regimen, even only ""maintenance therapy"" (so less intense) for a year). It is hard, my life has changed completely. But YES: it is worth it for me! I was able to get married, we will be able to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. I went on more vacation trips than in YEARS before. My relationships to many family members and friends has become much deeper and I want to stay a little longer here among them. 

But I don't know, honestly, if I will go through all the treatments my doctor will suggest me. I know that at some point, he will suggest to switch back to my initial chemo regimen or something very similar. And I don't know if I will really opt for quantity of life over quality of life at that point. At the moment though, my choice is clear: I'm doing chemo. But I adapt it to my timetable. If there is an event that is really important to me, my chemo gets pushed back a little. I know that I should not do that too often. But from time to time, I have to because quality of life is important. My doctor understands and encourages me in this choice.

I don't know if my words help you a little? May I ask about your situation? Also, the last thing I wanted to say: it is probably also possible to give chemo a shot and if after a few rounds you see that you really can't bear it, you can still opt out. I would probably recommend at least trying. Some times chemo turns out to be more bearable than you would imagine. It's no walk in the park, at all! But it really can be worth it, even palliative. Just a ""warning"": my first chemo round ever (in 2013) was THE worst of all! I know I am not the only one. It can actually get better after. But of course, there's no certainty for that. I'm just sharing my experience.

Ok, so I'll stop here. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Or if you just want to share what you are going through (as a patient or caregiver, I'm not sure), I'm here too.

Take it from someone who knows what they're talking about: it is worth it. I don't know chemo for Hodgkin's of course. But if it is anything like mine: Do it! Especially if your treatment is curative! There is so much more in store for you here on earth! Chemo will - in a very hard way - enable you to live all these amazing things!

I was scared, I was angry, I was in utter shock when I got diagnosed. The treatment is rough. But I would not be here anymore without it. Since my diagnosis, I have gotten engaged and married, I have grown as a person in an incredible speed, I have become a pretty ambitious and good amateur photographer, I later have picked up piano as a hobby too and make progress in that too. I have several commitments as a volunteer. I have gone on so many trips to Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Scotland and Switzerland (where I live). 

You see: I can still do stuff. At first, I cut back on activities because my initial treatment was more intense. But even then, I had good moments, even excellent ones. As far as I know, it is very likely for your treatment too that you will recover in between chemo rounds. You will have bad days, that's sure. But you will have good ones too!

Shortly after (a little over two years ago), we found out that the cancer was still there - and aggressively so. I went on palliative chemo and that way, we were able to stabilize the cancer. But it's still there and I know that my treatment will probably forever stay a battle for more time, not a cure.

It was an 11 cm tumour located in her kidney but it was so large it encroached on a major vein. It wasn't found anywhere else. 

It was removed in November of last year, several days before her 25th birthday. Radical nephrectomy. We hoped that would be the last of it. 

She had her first post op ct scan a few days ago. Unfortunately they have found what looks like a 6x3x3cm recurrent tumour as well as several 10-15mm masses in the lymph nodes. One of which is in the sternum. This is an aggressive growth, the consultant said he had never seen anything like this.

We have only seen the surgical consultant so far, but we are seeing an oncologist next week. This seems odd to me. He thinks she will go on drug treatment.

I have done some research and I am none the wiser as to what her realistic chances are of remission.I have read survival rates after 5 years are 5% and I have also read that there is no recovery from this. 

I am begging anybody who has any knowledge of anything that will help me support her/cope to please give me some advice.

I don't know how to cope with it. My grandmother is getting old and she has a bad memory now, and i don't have a good relationship with my mother in law, she ignores me completely, or my step mom. They're both very manipulative and difficult people.

It is a difficult thing to bring up.  I would ask the doctor very candidly what his goal of a third chemo drug is after two have failed.

If she is advanced stage 4 without tumor response to chemo, besides the stroke, things well just continue to get worse.

WebbieVanderquack,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4bpug1,1,d1ed4vo,"&gt;I also feel guilty that she is sick. She spent her whole life telling me how much she sacrificed to care for me and her parents, and how she never did anything for herself, and now I'm afraid she's dying and won't get a chance to live a happy life. 

Raising a child and having a ""happy life"" should not be mutually exclusive. I'm sure she made a lot of sacrifices to raise you, but she brought you into the world. Making you feel guilty about that is nonsensical and unreasonable.

Your feelings are all totally rational. You shouldn't ""feel like the entire burden of her caregiving and emotional support has fallen on your shoulders."" You're a young woman with a fledgling career, and it's not selfish to want to make your way in the world - it's a responsibility. After your mom is gone, you'll have to look after yourself, and presumably you have to pay your own bills while she's sick, so dropping everything to be by her bedside 24/7 isn't going to work. It's about balance.

If her friends are all hammering you about what you should be doing for her, you need to rope them in and ask them for help. If someone tells you you should be making her chicken soup, you say ""I'm really struggling to manage all this on my own, but if you'd be willing to make some chicken soup, that would be so helpful."" 

Talk to your own doctor about what resources there are to help you and your mom. I'm in Australia, so things are a little different. I recently talked to my doctor about my own parents, who are getting old and not in great health, and she said we could access respite care (where someone steps in as carer to give you time out), cleaners in the home, stuff like that. 

You also need to be honest with your mom about your limitations. Being sick - even being VERY sick - doesn't mean that all other considerations in life are suspended. Your mom should understand your financial and time limitations and be willing to work around them. It might even be worth seeing a counsellor who specializes in palliative care to help negotiate with you both and just help you cope with it all.

TL;DR: So sorry for what you're going through, don't feel guilty about any of it.",t3_4bpug1,,2016-03-26 18:02:08,,,Having a lot of weird feelings about mom's cancer,"A couple of weeks ago my mom was diagnosed with a pretty sarcoma, stage III.  They are moving ahead with treatment and have a protocol, but from my research I know that the prognosis is not great.  5 year survival is around 39%.

I'm 28 years old.  I'm an only child, and my mom has no spouse.  It's just the two of us in my immediate family, though I do have an uncle, two cousins, and an aging grandfather.

I live about 1.5 hours from my mom, and though we get along fine now we had a pretty shitty relationship while I was growing up.  She used to be extremely manipulative, controlling, and emotionally abusive.  Since I've become an autonomous, financially independent adult, however, most of that behavior has stopped.  I love my mom, but for a really long I don't think I did.

I feel like the entire burden of her caregiving and emotional support has fallen on my shoulders.

I'm a freelancer, and things have been slow the last couple of months Keeping my head above water financially requires near constant effort, and since all this started about 8 weeks ago I've practically abandoned my business to be there with her in the hospital.

I don't want this responsibility. I love my mom but I don't want this to be my job.  I'm supposed to be moving to the opposite end of the country next year, which has been my dream forever and now I don't see how that will happen. 

Everyone keeps trying to comfort me and people are expressing condolences about how scared and sad I must feel, which honestly just infuriates me. Because while I absolutely don't want anything to happen to my mom, that's not really what I'm feeling. Selfishly, I want someone to acknowledge the burden this is placing on me and how much I will end up sacrificing.  And I feel really guilty for feeling this way.  

And then all of the expectations that people have for me! The way her friends have been hammering all the things I should be doing for her down my throat and making me feel like a terrible daughter is making me insane. 

I also feel guilty that she is sick.  She spent her whole life telling me how much she sacrificed to care for me and her parents, and how she never did anything for herself, and now I'm afraid she's dying and won't get a chance to live a happy life. I don't blame myself for that, but I feel some strange survivors guilt or something because she is scared and sad and sick and I feel like things never worked out for her.  I feel like for me to be okay living my life the way I want, her life has to be okay too. All I want is for her to have a happy life independent of me.

I don't feel overwhelming grief, but I feel confusing and complicated guilt on top of a little resentment and no one seems to understand and I don't have anyone to talk to.  I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. I just want us both to be ok.

Blockhouse,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4d6o6l,8,d1ofee8,"&gt; I want to have hope that he can beat this, but the facts are that it has a 80% mortality rate.

I am going to be blunt here, not because I intend to be cruel, but because I believe people make the best decisions when given all the facts and have developed reasonable expectations.

I think there has been a communications breakdown at some point, and you're laboring under a misconception of what's going on.  With metastatic (i.e. stage IV) lung cancer, there is no 80% mortality rate.  Metastatic lung cancer is beyond our ability to cure.  Unless something else takes their lives first, like a car accident, side effects of chemo, or surgical complications, metastatic lung cancer patients uniformly succumb to their disease.

We can slow down the disease's course and delay death; Opdivo works well for that.  We can deal with symptoms as they arise; radiation therapy and steroids work well for new brain metastases.  Its been nearly a year since his diagnosis; he's already had more time than a lot of  metastatic lung cancer patients get.  But there is going to come a time when the benefit of the treatments are going to be exceeded by the side effects they cause.  At some point, the Opdivo is going to stop working, and at that point, treatment options will consist of chemo that doesn't work as well and causes more side effects.  Or he'll develop new brain metastases in areas that cannot be irradiated.  This is simply the natural course of the disease.

So at some point, he's going to reach a tipping point where it just doesnt make sense to keep fighting a losing battle.  I can't tell you when that will be, neither can anyone else.  But I think you and your father should probably talk with his oncologists and develop a plan for when that day comes, what it will look like, and what he'll need to keep comfortable.  If he hasn't met with a palliative care specialist, I would absolutely suggest that this happen, and that you go with him to meet them; they can be a huge help to you too.

I'm not suggesting that you give up.  I never, ever say that and I hope you don't interpret these words as such.  What I suggest is that you define your goals and examine how you're going to accomplish them.  Most patients in your father's condition say their goal is to extend life as long as possible, so long as they can do so with comfort, dignity, and meaning.  Maybe another round of gamma knife and chemotherapy is the best way of accomplishing this goal.  Maybe they aren't, and focusing more exclusively on comfort is the way to go.  I don't know your father; I can't say.  But his oncologist does, and maybe it's time to ask the oncologist to explore these matters in more depth.

I am truly sorry for you and your father.
",t3_4d6o6l,,2016-04-03 20:02:20,,,My father has been fighting lung cancer for a year...How do I keep hope?,"Hello everyone,

Last June, my father was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. It was already spreading to other areas of the body, including lesions on the brain.

They were able to remove the lesions with the gamma knife procedure, although it left scar tissue that caused problems after the procedure. He was in the hospital after seeing red lights and losing functioning of his left arm. He was able to get rehab and recovered his left arm.

Meanwhile, he went on chemotherapy treatment. It made him very sick of course, and he started to eat less and less. He was a pretty heavy guy, and lost about 150 lbs. He had to go in and out of the hospital due to low blood hemoglobin from the chemotherapy (so they say).

We checked to see the progress. The chemotherapy did not stop the spreading at all. He was given 3 months at that point.

We started a alternative treatment, Optivo, which is an immunotherapy. The side effects were way less severe, but he still had no appetite. He was running on the fuel of 2-3 Ensures a day and not much else. We checked the progress again, and the cancer stopped growing, however there were some small new developments elsewhere in the body.

He started to get up and walk around a little bit each day, even go outside and sit on the porch. He was actually starting to try real food again, asking for french toast one morning and oatmeal another. I was feeling pretty hopeful at this point that the Optivo would start to kick in harder and start to reduce the cancer.

Then, a week ago, on my birthday, my mother and sister went out to pick up food for my birthday dinner. My dad was sitting with a couple of his grandchildren, and then I noticed he was spacing out.  I asked him what was wrong, and he said ""something isn't right"" and his arm started twitching. He said he wanted to go to the bathroom, so I guided him to the bathroom and helped him get on the toilet. It was very apparent something was wrong but my mother was going to be home any minute and then I was going to call 911. After he got up from the toliet, he thought he was already back in the other room and tried to sit down. I helped him to the chair, my mom came home, and we called 911.

911 came and were there for about 3 minutes before he started having a compulsive seizure. I've never seen anyone have a seizure before, let alone something like that happen to my father. I thought he was dying right there. They got him to the hospital and put him on anti-seizure medication.

He is still in the hospital now, as he keeps having focual seizures where he sees a red light, slouches off and mumbles. This lasts for about a minute, but has been happening often throughout the day while they try to regulate the medication. We notice his speech is slower, I wonder if that's just a side effect from the medication. He is still able to talk and remember things.

The doctors think it is being caused by the scar tissue from the gamma knife procedure. They also did a MRI and saw a new lesion on the brain. He is too weak to get the gamma knife procedure right now, not to mention they won't do it if he is still having seizures.

So, now we are waiting a couple more days for him to be released home, so he can be with my mother &amp; I. We hope that the seizures slow down or pass altogether so we can focus on getting him to eat more and get healthier for another gamma knife procedure.

It's very painful to watch this happening to my father. He was a very hard working man, and loved working in the food industry. To see him repulsed by food, to have seizures in the middle of talking, and see him 150lbs skinnier than he's been my whole life, is taking a great toll on me and my family. I want him to pull through, I want him to eat, but I don't want to force him to eat.

It's been a year since he was first diagnosed, and I've been upset about it a lot, but this last episode with the seizure really hit me hard. I would always worry on my way home from work that my father would be dead. And, I would always come home and he would be there. After a while, I got comfortable with it, thinking I was over worrying. I had hopes, since he was still here, that he would get through it. But after this past week, I've been hit with a lot of hard truths that I've been trying really hard to ignore.

I want to have hope that he can beat this, but the facts are that it has a 80% mortality rate. So, I constantly switch between trying to be hopeful to trying to accept the facts. I've never lost anyone really close to me before. I'm 30, male, single, still living at home. I can't stop ruminating on what my fathers thinking about, if he'll be alive tomorrow, if he's going to go peacefully. I'm also worried about what I will be like after.

That would be the Zofrans and Phenergans for nausea, steroids for appetite, others for sleep, etc. He's an outstanding doctor and I do trust that if he thought it would help her, he would prescribe it. 

Of course she is free to make her own judgment to use marijuana or not without his assistance since it's not legal in our state anyway.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with medical marijuana and marinol (it's a synthetic THC drugs here in North america, It's prescribed for nausea and to increase appetite.) And how they would compare the two?  In my mind medical marijuana is a better choice for some reason. 

I was curious more of the increasing appetite possibility in cancer patients. 

I personally think medical marijuana (I'm thinking more of the oil variety for a patient with mouth/throat cancer)  would be great in these situations but unfortunately there are only clinics and no dispensaries where I live so I feel like marinol would be easier to obtain. 

Any help appreciated!  Thanks fellow reddit friends :)"

Dear friends and anyone who gives a shit about me and wants to help - I am now, in all seriousness, fighting for my life. So, first to update you about the surgery - everything went really well and I didn't turn into a zombie for 3 days like last time :D And thanks to everyone for writing, because it really cheered me up! :)
Now with the bad news: The latest  biopsy results showed that the tumour has progressed, so I am now dealing with a stage IV brain tumour called Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). That basically means that my diagnosis has reached a peak, so to speak - it cannot get worse than this. Since I live in a country that doesn't quite yet have advanced therapy techniques, and the therapy that was recommended to me is kind of an end-game scenario called PCV chemotherapy - which would maybe satisfy a 70-year-old, but I'm a bit more ambitious than that - I'm now looking for therapy options abroad. I like traveling anyways, so why not mix business with pleasure :D  
Now, for this I will need your help. What I would like from any person who is willing to help me is to ask around your city, think of any doctors you or your friends/family might know who have ANYTHING to do with brain tumours. Surf the web, try to find clinics, medical centers, universities where therapy for GBM is administered in your country; even if it is experimental - send it over! :) I can send the required medical documentation in English when/if necessary. If you are willing to help, please let me know below in the comments, via inbox or my e-mail trucevic@gmail.com
Also, if anyone - and I mean anyone - has anything they want to ask or comment or even just wish me good luck...feel free to do just that :) Thanks in advance to everyone who read through all of this and is willing to help me!

One of the hardest parts of stage 4 is the fact that the treatment is considered palliative- that is scary to read on paper. However, palliative care is actually incredibly important and helpful. Even during chemo/radiation, quality of life should be top priority, in my opinion. My dad is a cyclist, and he still rides a little on weekends, because he would probably get terribly depressed and decline quickly if he could not get out and ride. So, my tentative advice to you is to encourage your father to make the most of his time, and do what he enjoys whenever possible. I think emotional health is super important when dealing with something as incredibly stressful as late stage cancer. I (a total stranger) would also encourage you to go ahead and make the drive and visit as often as you want. No point in denying the severity of his disease- for me, at least, accepting it has freed me to cherish the time we have left together, which may be only a couple of months now.

He has no terminal date, I just am not sure what to do.  I don't think I've full come to term with the news yet...

My Dad is obviously feeling down, we've told him to stay off the internet - he's obviously done research the mortality rates past 1 year obviously aren't high -- but he can be the small percentage that does make it.

I live about an hour away from my family, and I've been trying to get home more then I have in the past, however I don't want me going back so often make my father think I'm doing this in part because he may not have long left...I don't think it matters, I just don't want him thinking about time frames of death.

Any tips on survivors or family members on what to do to keep morale high?  I'm sure it's tough...but, I'm not sure what to do...I've had extended family die of cancer...not this close, and not this terrible type of cancer."
AquaAzureAegean,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4g5ytg,2,d2f6kpk,"My husband was diagnosed with stage iv adenocarcinoma last August.  He had EOX (oxaliplatin, capecitabine which turns into 5Fluororacil in your system, and epirubicin) followed by 10 fractions of radiotherapy and is now on routine reviews.  As he was stage iv (liver mets) he wasn't a candidate for surgery, instead his treatment has been all about giving him more time - he's 48 now.  It's a bloody scary thing you're facing, I know.
  
As his chemo was palliative, he had 8 cycles back to back so no week off in between each cycle.  He kept his hair, which he was desperate to do!  It's funny how this hits you.  He's never been interested in his own appearance other than being washed and dressed, but losing his hair was genuinely his biggest fear over treatment.  My guess is that displaced the fear that chemo might not work very well.  He did get tired, occasionally nauseous but not much, and he got palmar-plantar syndrome along with peripheral neuropathy.  My best advice would be to regularly moisturise your hands before any symptoms arise (he was told to do that, but he's never moisturised in his life and had no intention of starting!)  Anyway, once his hands and feet started to suffer we had to moisturise several times a day to make sure he didn't lose his skin, get infections and end up being admitted.  Best moisturiser we found was Udderly Smooth with shea butter - our oncology centre recommended using udder cream and we tried a few, yrmv.  All in all he found chemo much less traumatic than we'd ever imagined.  He was only really too tired to do anything during cycle 7 and 8 but that tiredness improved almost daily after chemo finished.  Earlier on, we often went out and did nice things.  Plus he really took to heart the advice that he was to work hard at not losing weight.  For the first time in his life he could eat whatever he wanted and boy, did he manage that!!  It involved many, many spur of the moment trips to the store for me to get whatever he fancied right now, just to make sure he got calories in him.  His chemo was very successful, eradicating all visible trace of cancer in his liver - that doesn't mean it's gone, just it's too small to see.  But his liver looked like a bag of marbles with tumours when he was diagnosed so that's pretty damn fantastic progress!  The oesophageal tumour had initially looked like Jabba the Hutt, with the upright bit of him being my husband's oesophagus and Jabba's tail being spread/ooze.  Well, after chemo all the tail was gone and the upright bit is so reduced I had concerns he'd be able to rupture it with sharp toast!

Now, that's a lot of detail about my hubbie's individual case and bear in mind with palliative treatment they want to extent quantity of your time here without destroying too much quality.  As you won't be on a palliative regime I guess things may well be different for you.  I do believe that he's done so well as once he got over the initial WTF period, he brought his A-game in stubborn to the fore.  He decided he was going to fight, he was not going to tolerate cancer within him and he was absolutely going to be in the tiny few that win at stage iv.  He took his meds exactly as instructed, he did as much exercise as he could manage every day - no gym sessions but some days he could walk for hours, other days 10-15 minutes of strolling was just about it.  He also tried to listen to his body, sleeping when he felt the need, eating whatever he craved.  Between us, we were honest with his oncologist (husband would slip into the 'not complaining cause I'm a tough man' thing so often I would need to be the one mentioning whatever) but this ensured he got the right care for things that were actually problems and reassurance when it was 'nothing to worry about'.

I know this is scary and it's okay to be scared.  But you can do this.  You are not alone, you have us here.  You are stronger than you ever realised and you can fight.

This isn't the perfect spot for it but if it's OK I'll paste my query here (if the mods are ok with that)...


I'll make this very brief and dense so I don't consume anyone's time. I had a nasty fight with throat cancer. I was a big dude before cancer: http://imgur.com/hZtqRMs

I was 360's but never smoked. I had gastric bypass to fight the weight but it (I..) failed. The weight all came back and more.

Three years ago I had tonsil cancer that had spread into my lymphatic system. I had surgery, chemo, radiation. I lost my teeth, have some facial deformity, and lost a lot of my taste and saliva. I cannot swallow well either and I choke easily and a lot.

The cancer is well into remission (yay!) and I look ok on that front. The issue I'm having now is that I'm suffering from a syndrome called cachexia. It's a muscle wasting disease and it's kicking my ass. This is me yesterday: http://imgur.com/95eRLAc

The cachexia is slowly stripping away my muscle mass and I need to stop it. I just don't have much room left to wiggle. My bones poke out everywhere.

I'm here because you cannot eat your way out of cachexia. The only thing that really works is exercise. It needs to be intense, weight bearing, vigorous. I know that seems counter-intuitive but it's how it's done. I don't know jack about working out. I've been a fat slug my whole life. I live remotely in the pacific northwest too so there's not a local Planet Fitness for me to run down to either.

Is there someone that could spend a few minutes either typing or by Skype and would give me some ""how to get started"" pointers? I'm pretty weak and I can't afford to get hurt but I have to start clawing back from this. I'd love some fairly safe to do routines that I could follow that might stem this loss I'm having. I'd also like some diet advice if that's your thing. I smoothie out most everything since swallowing is tough.

On the plus side I eat the most pure, clean, no-crap diet of anyone you'll ever meet. I eat zero refined sugar because it tastes like crud to me (rad damage to the taste buds). I can't have any processed meats (nitrates can trigger the cancer back) and no alcohol. I eat a ton of bananas and peanut butter, soft fruits, pressure cooked veggies, etc. I try to have chicken or fish but it's really hard to swallow. I do eat eggs though.

Anyway, thanks for reading and if you can offer some specific, tailored advice for my unique set of circumstances I'd really appreciate it. If you want to Skype just let me know and I'll gladly meet you. Sometimes my voice is not great but I'll give you my 100% if it's a not-good day. Mostly it's just that certain words are a little hard for me to say because my tongue doesn't work just right any more.

TL/DR: Had cancer, endured. Need to start training at age 47 or I'm going to wither on the vine and die.

Thank you for reading :) Have a great day!"
UnsinkableRubberDuck,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4hy088,6,d2ur9if,"Hi folks.  I'm Duck, my father was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer almost a year ago.  He went through 5 rounds of chemo leading up to last Christmas, which I was gratefully able to spend with him (he lived far away).  Three weeks ago, during my last week of classes, I received a call from his doctor to say that the time span was looking like a few weeks.  So, I put in motions the necessaries to have him transferred closer to me.

Good News: The paperwork was managed and he was finally brought here and transferred to a palliative care home in my city.  Also good, the doctors cleared his pneumonia and throat thrust infections and revised their estimate of 'a few weeks' to 'a few months.'  He's had 3 radiation treatments this week, with a final tomorrow, in order to try and shrink a tumor on his esophagus and superior vena cava for comfort's sake.  He could barely eat or swallow, but now is doing better, even within these two days.

Bad News: My dad is an ornery old man (65, so not that old), but he's grumpy and set in his ways.  He's spent the great deal of the last decade mostly alone, and wasn't socially well-adjusted before hand, so now it's even worse.  To put it simply, he's unpleasant to be around.  I'm his only family member, the only one who continues to see him and talk to him.  I do it because I love him, he's my dad, and because I know he has no one else.  I can't leave him to have no one, and I have some hope that if he has regular social interactions, then he might come around.

In the mean time, he takes it very personally and sulks when I correct him on something.  His mental capacities have really deteriorated the last year, and even a bit before that.  I know I could always leave the mistake uncorrected, and I do except for when it's something that will become relevant again down the road.  Example, he's waiting for mail and keeps thinking it should be delivered every day, even says with certainty it'll be delivered tomorrow, when I know that it won't be because it usually takes 10 business days to get between where he used to live and where I live.  He's almost losing his mind in the manner of a much older person, or someone suffering alzheimers, though doctors have yet to diagnose him with it.  He's also constantly saying or doing things that he means to be funny, and to gain him attention, but which either aren't funny, or aren't things you'd laugh at, so when I don't react to those things he gets sulky again.

Sorry, this was really long and I didn't really know where to put it, and I'm super exhausted because we had to go through Will and Power of Attorney paperwork tonight, and that took a couple hours.  I'm pretty drained, and I've taken a sleeping pill, so apologies if some sentences don't make sense.",t3_4hy088,,2016-05-06 04:11:03,,,Bi-Weekly Support Group Thread 05/04/16,"Welcome!

The pathology read almost word-for-word what my oncologist said to expect in the event of a negative result. I haven't spoken with my oncologist yet, but I know this means we're moving on to long-term surveillance and presumptive victory.

A little backstory: diagnosed in April 2015 with classic nodular sclerotic hodgkin's characterized by a bulky mediastinal mass. 6 cycles of ABVD. Basically no change from mid-treatment PET to post-treatment PET, Deauxville 5, max SUV 9. 20 daily administrations of IMRT (radiation) through the end of November. PET in January showed a focus of activity in the mediastinal mass, max SUV of 10.8, Deauxville 5. Core biopsy (risk of false negative) was negative. Waited until April. PET unchanged, max SUV increased to 10.9, Deauxville 5. Surgical biopsy (Right Chamberlain procedure) Thursday, came back as ""fatty cells [...] non-necrotic tissue indicative of chronic inflammation [...] no specific tumor"".

I'm not an easily excitable person, and my vision of the future is still tempered by increased risk for all forms of cancer and a very high chance of eventual relapse, but I must say this result is very pleasing. The thought of months and years going by without surgeries and strange drugs all the time is outright ticklish. Freedom from doctor's visits and awkward social interactions will be a boon. I thought some of you might draw inspiration from this. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I don't mean this in a religious sense when I say miracles happen. As quickly as life can change with a cancer diagnosis, it can change with a biopsy or scan result. I'll raise a glass of Cabernet to our good health as soon as I'm off painkillers from the biopsy.☺"

TXOmega790,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4mtkdb,6,d3y8n6p,"So, this would likely be stage 4 pancreatic cancer, as that is the origin even though the primary mass was removed. 

The 5 year survival rate is the standard period for ""surviving"" cancer, typically meaning if you make it 5 years cancer free you're ""cured"", and chances of recurrence are drastically lower. 

Now, beating stage four cancer is tough, chemotherapy and radiation are typically only palliative at this point in a attempt to prolong the patients lifespan and possibly improve their quality of life. There are a few reasons but the main one is that once you have distant metastasis developed it's typically a sign that your body/treatment is too overwhelmed to fight back and the latent number of cancer cells will only go up.

That being said, a year ago I had stage 2B pancreatic cancer (Acinar Cell Carcinoma, a very rate form), for which I had a distal pancreatectomy (from your mom's recovery period I'm thinking she may have had a Whipple?), a few months after that I had a follow up PET scan which showed a tumor in my chest ""upgrading"" me to Stage 4 AKA incurable pancreatic cancer. By all accounts there should have only been a slowing at the very most of the spread of my disease, especially since my distant metastase was in a Lymph node, making spread through the lymphatic system all too easy.

However, I'm currently ~6 months into being in remission. The lymph node in my chest which was about the size of a cumquat (tiny orange) shrunk and remained at an insignificant size. There have also been no known metastasis other than this. Aside from the standard chemotherapy regimin for Adenocarcinoma (GFLIE chemo combo) and improving my diet (no more added sugars or processed foods for the most part), I spent a few months on a high dose of FECO or Full Extraction Cannabis Oil, colloquially known as RSO. I don't want to give you false hope, there's no ""proof"" that any alternative treatment has helped me fight my cancer. However, even if the FECO didn't have a curative effect, it made my treatment SO much more tolerable. I was able to avoid taking nearly all of my anti nausea and other maintenance meds which was great. (A process which I did slowly and under my Dr.'s supervision to ensure I didn't screw myself over with nausea or other side effects in the process).

I've done a large amount of research on both contemporary and alternative treatments for Panc. cancer. Feel free to ask me any questions, especially regarding medical marijuana as it's a subject filled with contradictory information and horrible ""science"".

My mom is 56, and was first diagnosed with stage 2a pancreatic cancer, last August. She got a surgery to remove the tumor and all was well. 10 months went by while she was still recovering from surgery before chemo was scheduled. Last week they saw her tumor markers were high and found that she now has bile and liver cancer, stage 4. It's been 10 months since surgery and I'm wondering why no one saw this month's ago? How did it become stage 4 10 months later, in a different area? Although I understand it travels in the body... I just thought all seemed clear.

I'm now looking at statistics for survival rates and I'm confused. I keep seeing things about a 5 year survival rate. So what? Is it 5 years only? Can you not beat it? Only prolong surviving as long as you can? 

She is scheduled for 6 months of chemo. I'm going to be on top of her diet and pretty much overall health. I'm looking into cannabis oil and every other measure.

TXOmega790,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_d3y8n6p,4,d3y9422,"Also, as to your questions about the spread of cancer. Having a successful surgery for Pancreatic Cancer is the ""best"" and typically only effective treatment. This means a surgery with negative margins, where it appears that all cancerous tissue was resected. However, cancer spreads via cells which are impossible to spot until they gain enough mass to be picked up by either blood counts or imaging tests (specifically CT and PET scans).

That's why cancer patients are constantly frustrated by the ""oh, you're all clear! Congrats, you're done!!!"" Type of logic. Because despite the appearance of being ""cured"" to those inexperienced with cancer, your body could very well harbor small colonies of cancerous cells which are just too small at the moment to appear. It's a very complicated problem and a specter that looms over many cancer survivors for the rest of their lives.

So, even though your mom may have had a successful surgery, this is exactly what stage 4 cancer means. Distant metastasis from the initial tumor. Having an ""all clear"" scan or diagnosis could very well be only temporary. 

Stage 4 typically means your cancer has outwitted your immune system and your body has no way to fight the disease. As I said before, care at this point is typically only palliative i.e. an effort to prolong life and quality of life, with no real curative goal.",t3_4mtkdb,,2016-06-06 16:55:41,,,,

And I'm happy to see so many helpful responses to us newcomers.  If anyone would like to help me out as well, I'd be very grateful!

Mom's been dealing with pain in her right hip/groin area since last fall, with an eventual lump that's been growing in the same area but wasn't noticed until a month ago.  A couple CT scans and xray didn't show anything, so she insisted on an MRI.  Well, the report shows metastatic lesions in the bone marrow, and she is scheduled for a biopsy of the groin lump tomorrow. Her doc said it's definitely cancer, based on the lesions, but no idea what kind/how bad/where it's actually located.  Although one might assume the lump in her groin?  She's in a ton of pain, and has lost her appetite, and feels quite nauseated all the time - all of which seemed to get dramatically worse over the past few weeks. These symptoms came and went since last fall, but only in the past month have become daily, and are worsening rapidly.

I obviously have a billion questions that will have to wait until the biopsy results come back, but was wondering if anyone else started this way, what happened, or what their experience was like.  Also wondering if any of the circumstances I mentioned might point one way or the other in regards to what we're dealing with. 

Also, she lives alone, with no local friends to lean on.  Her support system is just me (30 minutes away) and my brother (5 minutes away).  I'm far more of the caregiver, and am anticipating a massive shift in priorities over the next few months (she already cannot drive due to the pain in her groin and leg).  Any advice on getting help (or where to ask)?

I am so so sorry for your fathers situation. I have stage IV colorectal cancer since 3 years. I think that there would be options for him, maybe not for a cure but for more time. I am doing chemotherapy even though since 2 years it is only palliative.

But... And this is awful. It costs money. I don't know how the health system is in your country? It makes me sick to my stomach when I think of those millions of people who have a similar diagnosis and no access to treatment. I know that I am still very privileged. 

How is the access to treatment in your/his country? 

Really, I am very sorry. I wish him, you and the whole family lots of strength as you go through this. ",t3_4ofwik,,2016-06-17 22:10:30,,,My father was just diagnosed with colorectal cancer,"(Apology is grammatical mistakes, English is my second language)

My father was diagnosed today with state 4 colorectal cancer, with metastasis in his lung and liver. They are going to perform a surgery on him but probably he has very little time left even with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 

My family lives in a third world country while I'm living and working in Europe, 9000km away from home. I'm going to submit my resignation letter next week and go home soon for good, giving up on a very comfortable life I just started here.

Could anyone with experience regarding colorectal cancer share your experience and story? I'm totally devastated right now that during the last 6 years,  we spent very little time together because I went to college abroad and started working afterwards, and now I'm going to lose him forever. .."
DrunkenWeasel,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4ptulf,5,d4o9cgb,"My dad passed two months ago in a hospice inpatient unit after nearly a year in the hospital following Leukemia treatment and complications following a Bone Marrow Transplant. He was my rock, my mentor, and my best friend. As his primary caregiver, I was by his side every day, as it sounds like you are as well. As caregivers we wear many hats, but the common foundation is love. We would do anything for them including willingly giving up our time to feeding them in the hopes of regaining strength. Even if we leave the room during uncomfortable times,  our loved ones mean everything to us, and they know it. I was lucky enough to hear my dad's appreciation for everything during his treatment, and I can say with certainty that your dad feels the same.

Palliative care didn't occur until it was time to make the decision to withdraw life support but they were fantastic. They stayed with me as much as I needed and answered any questions I had. They treated the decision with respect and made sure I understood what was going on and what was going to happen at each step. They met with hospice and I to determine what level of hospice care was appropriate. Most hospice occurs at home, but with my dad's need for 24/7 care, they accepted him as inpatient and transferred him. The facility kept me updated and I spent all day with him. Even non-responsive I hadn't seen him as comfortable since he started treatment. I went home for the night to transfer personal effects and get some sleep (since the inpatient unit was so close to home) and I got the call during the night that he had passed. He didn't want to pass with family around.

Hospice can get a bad rap. Yes, its true terminal patients seek hospice care, but it is less about having a place to die and more of a place to pass peacefully and with dignity. I'm not sure if palliative care has already consulted with hospice or not, but hospice should start a pain management program to hopefully keep your dad pain-free. Unfortunately this can have the side effect of placing your loved one in a fog.

It sounds like you've made the decision to be there until the end, an admirable decision. It's tough, but try not to think ahead too far, there's enough on your plate for today to be worrying about next week, month, year... Take things one day at a time. Don't let anyone tell you how you need to feel, just know that it is important not to keep things bottled up. Remember your dad in good times, forget the bad times. If need be, see if the hospice has a 24 hour helpline just to have someone to talk to and get things off your chest, even if it means you wait until afterwards...

Finally, just know that everyone in r/cancer loves you and is here for you. You're never alone here. PM me if you need to talk (even if it's to talk about random stuff just get your mind off hospitals and cancer), or just keep posting in this thread and we can all keep in touch.

Hugs and all the best --DW",t3_4ptulf,,2016-06-26 03:31:03,,,Hospice,"My dad has been battling stage 4 cancer for over a decade, up until now, nearly completely inconspicuously. My fathers health has deteriorated at a rapid pace in the last month, and here I find myself in a hospice, witnessing every detail of his palliative care and asking myself what the fuck is going on?
The man I knew has gone and in his place a poisoned skeleton, only his eyes remain the same, but now fear and pain oozes from his tears. His independents has been robbed from him. The tables have turned, for 21 years this man has cared for in every way I know a parent can, all physically, emotionally, mentally and financially. He was my go-to man, he knows all the answers. Now I'm feeding him baby sized pieces of fruit and helping him move inches in his bed. I dash out the room when the nurses come to uncover his dignity, I hear him screaming in pain. 
 
My only previous knowledge of hospices was that I'd picked up in films, and we all know, people come here to die. Something I struggle with walking to and from the day room to get my cuppa and sneak someone else's soya milk in my tea. 
The nurses are so wonderful, I showered earlier and nearly forgot where I was. 
I'll be spending all the remaining time my dad has in this world in this reclining chair i sit on now, tending to his every need. 

I've never lost anyone in my family, let alone my hero and I'm shit scared, I feel really alone and cant even comprehend this feeling. 
Has anyone else been in a similar situation? "
_Choppy,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4q7nsk,1,d4r2hia,"Sorry about your loss. 

For what it's worth, I've never heard of anyone getting an IV for home use. Even palliative care doesn't do that. Also, home care, whether palliative or hospice, doesn't provide 24/7 care. In the US, you would pay out of the pocket for that. 

However, if your grandma was that close to end-of-life, even a nurse being with her around the clock would not have changed that.

Hopefully she passed peacefully &amp; sounds like she was with family and at home. Maybe one day yoy will find comfort in that.",t3_4q7nsk,,2016-06-28 11:27:57,,,Sad and angry after my grandma's passing... few questions,"She had cancer for 3 years and it had spread.  The last few weeks she ended up in the emergency room but she quickly got better and came home.  My parents requested a nurse and IV fluid at home.  The last week they kept calling for the nurse and the hospital kept postponing it, ""oh, she hasn't come yet? we'll call you back and let you know).  She had insurance and everything, so it was weird.  We kept calling back and wondering what's happening and finally they told us they'll send someone the following week.  Meanwhile her Oncologist said that he prefers not to give IVs for home use, it's one of his ""rules."" We called the hospital that he was working at and they said that it's the Oncologist's wishes and we can't do anything about it.  My parents ended up calling the nurse that was going to come in a week and the nurse said that she'll call the hospital and see why that is.  Anyway, long story short, she passed away later that week.  She seemed to be getting better so it totally caught us by surprise.  What I keep thinking about is how negligent the hospital and the Oncologist were.  Is this normal?? Am I just trying to find something to blame this one or is this seriously the wrong way to treat a patient? I keep thinking if only she had a nurse around her, and the IV fluid, perhaps she would've been alive now.  It angers me more than my parents, but I just don't know how to stop thinking about that.  I keep reading about patients who had nurses with them 24/7 caring for them, and she never even had a proper home care because of the hospital(which btw is supposed to be one of the best in the world)... Granted both my parents were looking after her and taking care of everything, but they're not nurses.... And here I am without my grandma.  It makes me so angry. "

UR_Face,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4qj90k,3,d4tx303,"I was in a similar situation as you previously (father diagnosed with pancreatic - stage 4 (mets in liver), not able to do whipple. parents married 40 years, I lived 1000 miles away, and had my own issues to deal with (work-related) ).


Here is my advice: there are 3 areas to focus on


you - losing a parent is huge, no matter what the previous history is with your relationship. Figure out small things that you can do daily to help relieve the stress. depending on your personality, this may be talking to your SO/close friends, therapist, or other. I cant stress this enough - everyday do something. it may not seem like it matters, but if you dont, the stress can build. Do you want to go see him, and when?

For me, this was going to yoga or taking long walks everyday. I also ended up going on anxiety meds for a bit (had some odd physical manifestations of stress as well), and eventually decided that i needed to switch jobs. I never really talked about it with other people (probably do more on reddit than real life), but thats just my personality. I frequently visited my parents during his illness. His death (almost 2 years after diagnosis), came fairly quick, and without warning - he was on the phone chatting about selling a car one minute, the next minute - he just passed.


your dad - he is probably having a hard time coming to grips with the end of his life (from experience - the mental side-effects of cancer &amp; chemo can be worse than the physical). be there for him - talking, doing chores, etc. what do you think would make his mind stress less? California - since he lives there, I'm sure he would be qualified to have medical marijuana - which will decrease the pain he has, and will help with the appetite. talk to the palliative care nurse/hospice about other ways to make him comfortable. 


For my dad, my support was in different phases. For the first couple months he was doing chemo, i moved in with them. My mom still worked (that was her stress reliever), so he really enjoyed having someone at home with him - not necessarily engaging with him the whole time, just someone 'there'. When i was not living there, we talked on the phone every single day. When i got engaged, he really enjoyed planning the wedding on our daily calls. He also used prescribed marijuana, which he said helped with the appetite, nausea, and overall pain. near the end, he was taking pain meds along with everything else.

(I'm going to apologize for the tone in the next piece ahead of time - while it may not be something you want to hear now, its something that will be one of the longest phases, and potentially the hardest, to deal with)

your mom - figure out what her coping mechanisms are - and help her out with some stress. is she worried about finances? making your dad comfortable? what is she going to do after your dad passes? does she have hobbies? does she need help around the house? (these may not be appropriate questions to ask her now, but something you should think about). from a legal perspective (IANAL),  what are the plans for a funeral? Does she have all the account information to access (checking, life-insurance, 401k)? Is there a will? What does her financial support look like after he is gone (ie, does she need to work)? if she does move/sell a house - wait atleast 6 months (if financially ok to do so) to decide that. if money is going to be an issue for your mom, having the accounts/affairs in order ahead of time will help in the long run. during the initial period of grief, there will be a ton of things she will want taken care of, but may be blocked in doing so (ie need death certificates to file for life insurance claims), so being able to fill her time during that waiting period will also be important. identifying siblings, close family members that can assist as well will also help.


for my mom, she had talked about alot of the things above with my dad prior to his death, but didnt take any action on them. She quit her job a year prior to his death, and had a few hobbies she kept (to keep her sanity), and finances (according to my brother and I) were not one of her worries - she always worried about money. We had to get his affairs in order during last years holiday season - which was hard for my mom. alot of offices were closed (social security, etc) and it helped greatly that my dad was so organized. we found all the info we needed, and once we got the death certificate and the offices were open, it was fairly easy to handle everything. get this stuff moving was a huge relief for my mom. she is still finding things she needs to deal with, but has started getting more involved with her hobbies, and volunteering. I visit quite often, and my brother is nearby for the small things. we still have yet to do anything with the house, but my mom starting talking (as of last weekend) about downsizing, so that is on the horizon.


one more piece of advice - every day is not going to be good, and not every day is going to be bad. grief comes in waves. take it one day at a time, ensure you are checking with them frequently, and keeping yourself 'sane'. Feel free to PM me if you need to chat.",t3_4qj90k,,2016-06-30 13:30:17,,,my dad is losing his fight,"last may, my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. on june 4, 2015, he had a whipple procedure done. he was deemed a risk candidate because of previous poor health (2 strokes, diabetes, partial paralysis, memory impairment, morbid obesity, the list goes on) but due to having very good health in his youth and having been somewhat of a body builder, his surgeon rallied and got him approved. my dad got through the surgery and was happy to have his life back.

immediately after the surgery, micro cells in lymph nodes (this is how it was explained to me by my mom) that were tested from the surgery tested positive for cancer. doctors wanted to do a round of chemo to try to prevent the spread and hoped that my dad would become cancer free. he went through a round of chemo, which finished in february, and got scans and testing done to see where he stood. pictures showed that he had small cancer tumors in his lungs, but they were largely very small (under 1 cm), so his oncologist wanted him to come back in june for more testing and scans to see if my dad should go through another round of chemo.

yesterday, my father went in to get the testing done. his doctor cancelled all of his appointments for today (including my father's), i guess something came up, but apparently the testing raised enough flags that his doctor reviewed everything and called my mom. some tumors got smaller, some got larger, but the cancer has spread further in his lungs, to his liver, and to the lymph nodes in his back. he has a lesion in his liver. the doctor says it will be incurable and if my dad wants, he could do chemo for the rest of his life to prolong it a little. his doctor wants to set up another appointment ASAP to discuss more details and timeline. my father's breathing over the last several months had been getting worse, to the point where he's gasping for breath when i speak to him on the phone. he's in a lot of pain, which seems to get worse everyday. the news wasn't a surprise to him, since he says he literally felt it coming, but it doesn't make it any better. according to my mother, my dad is emaciated. his arms and legs are twigs, his face is sunken in, his belly protrudes, and he has an excess of extra skin on his belly. before my dad's whipple last year, he weighed roughy 320 lbs. my mom is guessing he's sitting at about 160 lbs right now, with about half of the weight loss occurring very quickly over the last few months, despite my dad finally having a healthy appetite.

my relationship with my father, and my family's relationship with my father, has always been very complicated. but i am fucking devastated. i've been dealing with other life-shattering events in my life this week, but this is too much for me. i mourn for my father, i don't want him to be in pain until the end. he lives in california, and i imagine he may seek out aid-in-dying, which is now legal in his state. even though it's something we were waiting to happen, it doesn't make it any easier.

reddit, how do i cope? how do i help my dad from 3,000 miles away (i live in new york)? how do i help my mother, who has been with my dad since she was 14 (38 years), get through this? she's all fucked up over it and i just want to support her through this and after this. for the first time in her life, she is going to be all alone, and she's starting to come to terms with that again after being unsure if my dad would make it through surgery last year. i've been the emotional support for my family my entire life and i'm trying to make myself be strong for my family now and to prepare for how strong i will have to be for them in the coming months, despite going through my own personal tragedies.

how do i do this? how have you done it? any and all advice is welcome. i'm just so scared and sad.

thank you for reading.

tl;dr my father's cancer has been determined to be terminal. how to cope? how to help my family, especially my mother who has spent her entire life with him? i'm lost."
buhooch,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_d4tx303,3,d4u9xen,"Wow- I wish I could've had this advice/info before my dad passed. But I still find this very helpful, so thank you for sharing. My father passed away 11 days ago on Father's Day, about a month and a half after his Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer diagnosis. That being said, we obviously didn't have much time to settle my father's affairs and I'm certain that our emotions have yet to catch up with us as a result. 

I live in the same city (Houston) as my parents, so I spent almost everyday with my dad, upon diagnosis. After a week however, as his health quickly deteriorated, I spent pretty much 24/7 with him. He spent 10 days in Palliative Care at MDAnderson and then 10 days at in-patient hospice. 

My parents were married for 41 years and I'm an only child. So I, too, was (and still am) very concerned for my mother. He was her everything and her, his. She cut back on work but is planning on going back next week. I think it'll be healthy for her to get back in the routine of things. She's also very involved with her church, so I'm hoping she'll get back into that as well. We still have a lot to take care of, but I think it'll be good for my mother and I to do some volunteer work together. I see it as an opportunity for us to spend time with one another, get our minds on something else and do some good in the process. I don't want to push anything though, because I think it goes without saying that everyone has their own timeline for grieving and sorting through their emotions. 

Whether near or far, you are still going through this too, so I agree that you must take care of yourself and keep yourself occupied and talk through it, rather than let it build up. I have yet to really figure this out for myself, but I have been leaning heavily on my SO and best friend. They have been on the receiving end of my many emotional outbursts and meltdowns, which occur most suddenly and randomly. I hate that I'm doing this to people who love me (and vice versa) but I know I would do the same for them. 

You mentioned your relationship with your dad was complicated so I'm not sure if you're comfortable with this, but I'd recommend saying everything you've ever wanted to say to your dad, sooner than later. Good, bad, ugly- say it. My mother and I also told my dad that we would miss him, but that we understood that he had to go. We gave him constant reassurance that we would take care of one another and of his mother, who lived with my parents and has fairly severe dementia. 

The best advice I got from a friend who lost her mother to breast cancer, was to take things one day at a time. Before she gave me this advice, I would think about all of these what ifs and it was literally driving me insane and giving my horrible anxiety. Don't do that to yourself. Don't let your mind wander down different paths and scenarios. Do what you need to do to get through the day, whether it's helping yourself, your dad or your mom, for that day, and leave it at that.

This is a rough disease, and stuff like diet change and marijuana at this stage aren't going to be enough. Get to know his oncologist, gauge if this doctor is going to go above and beyond for y'all, and if he isn't, you need to be putting your energy into knowing what treatment he has taken and using that information to find clinical trials. Clinical trials are going to be your number one best shot, because there are two options for chemo for this and neither one is very pleasant. 

On the emotional side, make sure you do everything you want to/he and your mother want to. If they want to get married, better to do it now. If he wants a particular meal, give it to him before the chemo destroys his taste buds and dry mouth makes eating a chore. If your mother is going to want something to remember him by, take videos at every opportunity. I didn't do that and now all I have is a thirty second voicemail from my dad that I know every word of by heart, and my mom doesn't even have that much. 

Finally, for god's sake, get a good palliative care nurse. It doesn't mean you're giving up, it just means you're doing everything you can to manage the pain (because there will be a lot of pain) and keep up a semi-normal life. His doctors won't always make him feel good because oncologists get jaded, particularly in this field, but a palliative care nurse is there to make people feel human and cared for.

First off, the article is about palliative care, but the clickbaity part is that doctors want to provide hope to patients and so give the patients options about using chemo even close to end of life rather than making end of life comfortable for incurable late stage cancers. 

It doesn't say in the article, but patients and family members of patients in these situations need to have good discussions with the doctor and ask tough questions about the real chance of cure vs palliative.

The-Duckfather,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4sn4hz,14,d5ao696,""" but mi father already knew what it does to people and that it would've killed her for sure, so we declined"" 

Is your father a medical professional? Otherwise I feel that assesment should have been made by an oncologist or other doctors. I have a hard time believing that they would suggest treatment, that would certainly kill her. 

If there's still time I suggest you switch her over to professional treatment at an oncology department, and if it's too late for treatment, direct her to a hospice for palliative care. 
I don't know about your mom's disease, but usually there is a lot of treatment options for breast cancer, even in late stages. So I really think you should reconsider just flat out declining chemo. 

When you're in pain, it's all you can focus on, it's insanely draining on everything - motivation drops steeply. 
I'm in that same boat with my mom. But because she is still in treatment (with cure as the ultimate goal), I desperately try to keep her motivated, by making her think of a possible better future.  
If there is no cure, no treatment, or no outlook for a better future in sight, while being in pain, then I think it's borderline impossible to keep spirits high. 

So in short: Follow the oncologists suggestion for treatment, seek second opinions if you're in doubt about their treatment plan. 
At the very least get her on palliative care at a hospice, they know how to take care of pain. The pain that cancer brings is inhumane, and cannabis alone simply won't be able to keep that down. 

Imo alternative treatment should be a last resort, when all medical options have been exhausted. ",t3_4sn4hz,,2016-07-13 15:25:55,,,"Methastatic breast cancer, spine damaged, muscle atrophy , no willpower",[deleted]
Iatros,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4su3iy,1,d5eug8o,"I had cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC in March of this year. The surgery sucks and you feel like total crap for a month, mostly crappy for the next month, and then only kinda crappy for a third month, and then you finally start feeling somewhat normal again. That's if everything goes exactly right, too, and complications can happen even if it's the most technically beautiful textbook-quality surgical case in the history of medicine.

For instance, my operation was complicated by a severe acute kidney injury for which I was on dialysis for about 2 months. I also developed a blood clot in one of the big neck veins (internal jugular) from the line itself, so I was on warfarin (blood thinner) for about 3 months too. And I had problems with a wound infection that opened up part of the wound. We left it open to heal from the bottom up, and I had to pack it with wet kerlex 2-3x a day for a month while it healed. I did take pictures, but trust me you don't want to see them. So, tl;dr it sucks ass.

========

But, it's also the only way forward (for me at least). I actually have to do *another* surgery in November, and despite the fucking awful post-op course I had, I'm *still* going to show up and get surgerized again. Systemic chemo will only take you so far. They'll go in and physically remove as much tumor as they can. Once they're happy with the result, they'll do the HIPEC which involved pumping heated chemo through your abdominal cavity for about an hour while they turn you every 5 min or so.

I can't give you specifics about your situation, but [HIPEC has substantially improved survival in colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal disease](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/21/20/3737.short). Median survival for IV chemo and palliative surgery only (things like relieving bowel obstructions or creating an ostomy) was 12.6 months vs 22.3 months with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC:

&gt;After a median follow-up period of 21.6 months, the median survival was 12.6 months in the standard therapy arm and 22.3 months in the experimental therapy arm (log-rank test, P = .032).

Keep in mind, too, that median means middle, not average, so fully half of people live longer than those numbers. Further, that study is pretty old, and they'll probably offer other things in addition to the surgery/HIPEC. For instance, I'm getting intraperitoneal chemotherapy between these surgeries via two ports they placed into the abdomen. 

It's certainly in your dad's best interest to discuss the possibility of surgery. The worst answer you'll get is that he's not an operative candidate. You guys need to talk to the surgeon and medical oncologist to figure out his prognosis and then go from there based on (1) patient wishes (2) overall life expectancy (3) whether or not he'd a good surgical candidate (4) if the surgery + recovery buys enough extra time to ""make up"" for the shitty months he'll have after the case. A lot of the answers to those questions are going to depend on your dad's individual case.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. I hope this was helpful. Feel free to PM any questions!",t3_4su3iy,,2016-07-16 19:33:15,,,Anyone have the HIPEC surgery? My father is considering doing the surgery.,"My father had his colon cancer come back in his abdomen in November/2015 and he has done 6 months of chemo.  The chemo has shrunk the mass down and his oncologist recommended he explored the HIPEC surgery.   

He flew to Chicago for a consult and is on the fence about doing this surgery.  Sounds like a brutal surgery and I am curious if anyone has some input. 

Thanks in advance!"
ikidu,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4tbh7p,9,d5g2et2,"First of all: I am very sorry. 

I have stage IV colon cancer too. I started with curative treatment (even though it was stage IV right from the start) but it did not work out. Still, in my experience stage IV cancer doesn't have to be an immediate death sentence. It could be - depending on many factors - that you will have your dad amongst you for years to come. I hope for that!

Myself, I got diagnosed a little over three years ago (April 2013). It was in February 2014, that my doctor had to tell me that he did not think that I could be cured. We started palliative treatment which for me too meant chemo again. This of course was and still is very hard to cope with. But the good news is: I'm still here. Still very much enjoying life. I'm not hiding from you that many days are still very hard. But I'm much more emotionally stable than two or three years ago. I don't know how it will be when ""my time comes"". But for now, I'm much better.

It is true, the chemo regimen your father is on will not work forever. But there are other options available. I have been on FOLFOX plus Erbitux, then FOLFIRI plus Avastin, then maintenance with only 5-FU plus Avastin and now on FOLFIRI with Zaltrap. If I understood my oncologist correctly, even switching back to one of the previous drugs could be an option for me in the future. Plus, there are other drugs available. 

That still does not mean that there is a cure available at some point in the future for your father and myself. But it does mean that the current regimen is not the only one that can give us more time with our loved ones. And in my experience, this time is precious. 

I wish you hope and many more good moments, even moments of happiness to enjoy with your father. All the best to you all!",t3_4tbh7p,,2016-07-17 21:38:45,,,Newly diagnosed colon cancer stage 4 with mets to the liver (my father).,"My father (52y.o) was diagnosed with colon cancer stage 4 in March of 2016 after presenting at his GP's office with complaints of pain under his ribs on the right side especially after eating fatty foodstuff a decreased appetite. His doctor and myself (a trained RN) assumed his gall bladder was acting up and that he probably had some gallstones. In other words we assumed it wasn't a complicated situation. His GP sent him for an ultrasound of his gallbladder the next day. What they found was a healthy and functioning gallbladder and a very large mass on his liver. Starting that day our lives became a whirlwind of doctors appointments and lots of tears and fear. My dad was sent that same day for a CT scan which showed ""tumors to numerous to count throughout every lobe of the liver and one large tumor measuring approximately 7x10cm"". That was a Wednesday. On Saturday he went in for a colonoscopy (as cancer in the liver does not normally originate there) the colonoscopy revealed a primary tumor near the ileocecal valve.  

My parents were scheduled to meet with an oncologist on Monday. I will not use his name because I refuse to slander a professional instead we will call him Dr. Doom. He came into the office where my parents were sitting looked straight at my dad and said ""you have stage 4 colon cancer. I'm going to give you chemo and keep you comfortable for as long as possible."" My mom immediately lost it and they left the office. On Wednesday after having some time to process, they went back armed with questions. Dr. Doom refused to give them any kind of options besides chemo. At this point I advised that we should seek other opinions until we found a doctor who would at least provide us with a sense that he was fighting this battle with us. 

We found a fantastic oncologist at a premier cancer treatment center and he started my dad on a chemo regimen of folfox and avastin. We have done 7 of 8 treatments and he goes in for the 8th treatment on Tuesday. The chemo has lessened his pain  and made him feel more comfortable. There was 3 cm of shrinkage on the large tumor at our last scan. His liver function tests continue to show marked improvements and his CEA is within normal ranges. We have been warned that he will most likely quit responding to treatments at some point. After the 8th treatment we are having more scans done and then meeting with our oncologist again to discuss the next steps. It sounds like making a move toward maintenance chemo.

We also went to mayo clinic and they confirmed that what my dads oncologist is doing for him is what they would have done as well. This was good news however left us with a sense of disappointment. I think we were hoping to walk into mayo clinic and be handed a cure (not realistic I know but cancer makes you desperate) . 

The worst part is watching the toll this is taking on my mom. They are high school sweethearts and have been together since they were 16 they are each other's whole worlds. They have raised 4 successful children ages 26,23,23,&amp;15. 

I guess what I'm hoping for out of this post is some hope.  Any other options, suggestions, or treatments that I may be unaware of and mostly I was just looking for a safe place to vent my story and frustrations with this whole process.

ShesGotSauce,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4tckar,9,d5gac2k,"That sounds like an extremely upsetting situation for you. You want your mom around for a long time so it's very hard for you to see her refusing treatments that might extend her life.

It sounds right now though that she's not interested in undergoing treatment and that's her right as an autonomous adult.  Many people prefer not to endure difficult cancer treatments. It may be time then that your role switches from trying to convince her to take treatment to supporting her decision to be comfortable instead. Advocate for her comfort. Pain relief and control of her psychic agitation.

Consider contacting a palliative care or hospice organization (many offer both). They will have advice for you.

Around 2 months ago she started to rapidly lose weight and had a personality change (nicer).  I began to seriously worry about her health. I repeatedly asked her to go to the doctors, she laughed it off and said it was her back pain tablets made her lose her appetite.

I got a call last Saturday saying she's been rushed to hospital with dizziness, a shadow on her lung (plus infection), blood clot in hand and a lump on her collarbone.
The doctors suspect it's lymphedema but we're still waiting on the biopsy results. 

She played nicely at the start and was clearly determined to take on the fight against cancer , she had two lesions drained from her brain. However she's become increasingly confused , has hallucinations and filled with paranoia. She's telling me her sister (recovering from cancer) wants to kill her and the nurses have ""injected her with insects"" and cancer, she hates me and even tried to bite me when I tried to put the monitor on her finger.
 This has been going on for days now and getting worse each day.
She's now at the point where she's refusing ALL treatment ,brain scans and even the heart monitor. She's not eating or drinking anymore , not taking medication and pulled out the drip
I've tried to reason with her but she's extremely aggressive and unreasonable. 

From what I've read up on the internet there's a chance she could live another 10 years with treatment.
We managed to sneak a sedative in a sealed drink to get her down to the MRI scan but she woke up and said to the doctor she will sue them if they continue.
Please help I am at my wits end I don't want her to die but nothing I say can talk her into it. she fed up just wants to die or go home.
There's talk of having her restrained or sectioned but she's a fighter I would hate her last days being put through that ordeal??
I don't know what to do for the best. This is extreamly upsetting would really appreciate  some advice from people not emotionally involved.
Her sane side prior to this wanted to live and since the brain operation  has has given up.

Advice: first make an appointment immediately with a psychiatrist or your GP and ask for some anti anxiety meds: clonazepam, alprazolam, etc. These will prevent you from having an panic attack at the drop of a hat. Will also help you get sleep--which you absolutely need now more than ever. If you're in pain, you maybe be able to get some opiate pain killers from your GP, but if not, definitely your oncologist or palliative care team.


Next, make an appointment at a nearby cancer center, preferably one affiliated with a university who does research. Typical treatment involves surgery, chemo and maybe radiation. If you don't like the advice the oncologist gives, go to a bigger, better know hospital for a second opinion. Based on your finances, keep doing this till you find an oncologist team you trust &amp; will give you hope. Cannot underscore the importance of the hope bit enough. Never lose hope, and never accept a doctor who has lost hope (except, of course, in the rarest and most severe cases). Also,after you fill you anti anxiety RX,do some reaseach on your type and who the respected doctors in you subtype are. You may end up coming to the for alternative opinion

Did over a year of miserable chemo after surgery. Surgery in itself was awful bc the tumor was in maxofacial area, so I lost 5 teeth and a large part of my upper palate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Eating was nearly impossible, talking was frustrating, and the pain from the nerves severed during surgery left me both in excruciating pain and frequent numbness. Now, I require a dental piece to appear almost normal--even though I can't eat with the denture in bc the tissue is still healing, making contact with anything painful. 

&amp;nbsp;

After the year of chemo, my oncologist congratulated me, set a final PET scan and told me we'd start tapering my off the oxycodone I'd come to rely on for the simply awful pain that plagued me even a year after the surgery. Did the scan, doc called on Fri with congrats, saying it looked good and she'll see me in 3 months for follow-up. I reminded her I was still in excruciating pain, so she offered to refill my rx and get a head/neck surgeon to take a second look at the scan. He did, thought the tumor site looked worrisome and did an (excruciating, inadequately anesthetized) biopsy and 2 weeks later had his intern tell me the cancer was still present and now inside my bone marrow. His proposal was to do a surgery that would remove my cheek &amp; leave the cavity open for months so he could monitor the site inside out. I would be grossly disfigured, unable to work, and hugely susceptible to infections during this time. Once the surgeon felt the tumor was gone for good, he'd do an 8 hour surgery removing part of my shoulder to replicate my cheek--which he admitted ""would not be perfect."" Yeah, no shit asshole. I said fuck that and got another opinion in NYC. Radiation seemed to kill the tumor, according to the scans and radiologist. 

&amp;nbsp;

After radiation, I transferred to a well respected but much smaller university sarcoma center to finish 6 more months of chemo. Unfortunately, during that time, the cancer had not responded to any of the chemo and spread to a few places--including my bone marrow. Well fuck. Current oncologist thinks she needs to temper my expectations by spelling out what palliative means and that we're ""no longer trying to cure you, just prolong &amp; keep comfortable."" I read the stats online, I know there's less than 10% chance ill survive 5 years. But I have something those deceased 90% don't: my family, friends, and limitless determination to fight this like the she-gladiator that I am.

Just read your post and the addendum. May I ask what type of cancer it is? You could also shoot me a pm if that's what you prefer. I can't offer much. But I could share a little about my 3 years of constant chemotherapy. There is no cure for me, just palliative treatment (since 2.5 years). I still choose to do chemo because it's the way better alternative. I am not sure if I will go through every type of chemo my doctor will suggest in the future. Essentially the first regimen I had was rough (and I know that they will suggest something similar again). But if my treatment was curative, I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. 

What I could offer to is to share about my experience with doctors. I know my oncologist very well by now and find him a very loving and caring competent doctor and human being. I know he is not corrupt and ""bought by the pharma industry"" in any way. 

Yes, treatment is expensive. And yes, sometimes this may be a shame. I don't see the pharma industry as holy... But if this expensive treatment is the only thing that can give me some more time here on earth with my husband, family and friends, I'll take it.

What everyone has said here already is pretty solid advice. I think putting the facts there and balancing her perspective from her hospice experience would be fair. I had a 66yo patient today who had EC-pap serous type. She finished chemo and is in remission. She said it was brutal on her QOL, but that she is enjoying getting her life back and is slowly getting back to her hobbies, passions, and spending time with her family. It wasn't anything she'd sign up for but if she had to do it all over again to save her life, she would. 


Chemo for cure is different than chemo for palliative. If it's curable, she should be given that information and that chemo doesn't equal death/hospice. Ultimately, as you know, it's her (informed) choice.

Her surgery is scheduled and she was told that depending on the results from the lymph nodes removed, she may require chemo and/or radiation. She doesn't want to do either since she used to volunteer at a hospice and has witnessed a lot of people with lower quality of life after they went through treatment.

I don't know if I should just support her decision or if I should try to encourage her to go for treatment if it's recommended. I'm a cancer genetic counselor, ironically enough, so I've met many people going through treatment as well. I've been trained as a counselor to be non-directive and never coax anyone into making a medical decision, but she's my mom. Am I being selfish for wanting her to consider it?

Without knowing the specifics of your case, there is a trial out there now that uses avastin and a second, experimental antiangiogenesis (stops formation of blood vessels, slightly different from avastin) drug that is considered palliative (life extending).


If you're interested, I can tell you the name of the trial and see if you have it available to you at your hospital (I'm assuming you aren't from the states as you mentioned Dutch) when I return to work. 


They also make these hats (for lack of a better word) that send impulses to the brain that also are supposed to stop tumor growth. It's pretty controversial and I'm unsure of the name as I do not see this treatment very often and I was not involved in the trials. Basically, you shave your head and wear these electrodes on your head for 72 hrs at a time (only remove for showering and then reapply). I believe it is used concurrently with avastin.

My father has cancer, an Olfactory Neuroblastoma. At first, they thought it was a Neuroendocrine Carcinoma, but afterwards they said it was an Olfactory Neuroblastoma. It started with a cold last december, it didn't stop and my father went to the doctor's who thought it was a nasal polyp. After some pictures, he was sent to the hospital and it came clear it was a tumor. A big tumor, blocking his right nose and even pushing the right cheekbones and surrounding bones of the eye away. Surgery had to be done to remove the tumor and afterwards radiotherapy/radiation. No signs of metastization was found, yet. Afterwards, 5 weeks of radiation started.

At the second to last day of radiotherapy, one swollen lymph node was found and punctuated for biopsy. (Sorry if these terms are incorrect, they are translated directly from Dutch) The result came in a few days later; cancerous.

A PET scan and CT scan were done and we went to the hospital for the result: the cancer still managed to grow while under radiotherapy, a tumor under his right nose (near the scar) has grown and spread surround his right eye vaguely. His lymph node was warm/hot as well on the PET scan and a small warm/hot spot was also found in a lung. The doctor told us it is not cureable anymore. Chemotherapy was adviced to lengthen life.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation / know someone who has? What kind of chemotherapy should be / has anyone seen being used with this?

Too much info leads to morbid leads to feelsies.","Hey Reddit,

Sorry about the long post, lots to get off my chest and since it was already typed I decided to leave it. There's a question somewhere in there I promise. Any advice is appreciated. The middle gets a little morbid but the end is ok again.

I fear I need to have a very uncomfortable conversation with my mom. A little background info:

My mom was diagnosed with stage 3 Ovarian cancer about 6 years ago and has been battling it on and off since. She's done chemotherapy twice and is now on a trial drug  (I don't know what the rules are on stating what trial she is undergoing so I will just describe it a little, maybe I'll add it in an edit later). She's been doing the trial for about a year now and up until a couple months ago her CA125 value has stayed around 6-8. Well, she recently had bad blood work so they had to cut the trial dosage in half and in the terms of the trial it says that once they half the dosage they aren't allowed go increase it again. This was when my family and I noticed once again that this terrible disease would return sooner rather than later and test all of our strengths again. Once the CA125 value reaches 50 they have to completely stop with the trial. In the past two months it has reached 15 and now last month 35 so it is rising fast and next month will probably be the end.

Ok, now to my conundrum. 2 years ago I moved back to Germany to finish my studies. I don't claim to be an expert on cancer treatments or any other medical treatment, but I do study medical engineering so I have a better understanding about this sort of thing than the rest of my family. I don't want to challenge my mom's oncologist about her treatment options, I fully trust her and truly believe that she is giving us the best information and providing us with the best options. However, the way the science looks at this moment in time and as much as I hate saying this, the day will come when the cancer will win.

Fuck, sorry for the long post. I already typed this up so I will leave it. I'm putting off asking my question because I don't know how to ask it and I'm tearing up thinking about this. I fucking hate this disease. So here it goes: I need to talk to my mom about how she feels about going through chemotherapy again. This is about to get morbid so stop reading if you want to. She is going to die and I have come to terms with it. It's just a question of if she let's cancer kill her or chemotherapy. It was such hell last time and from what I understand, it wouldn't add very much time. I just want her to know that I support her decision either way and if she wants to leave this world as a dignified human being instead of a potentially drugged up morphine ball, I understand even it means signing an essential death warrant. I also want to make sure that she really and truly understands her options and is not overwhelmed by the significance of it. This stuff is a lot to take in and we aren't necessarily given enough time to digest it and make the best decisions. I don't want her to rush into this or ignore it until she is forced to make a decision or, even worse, a decision is made for her. Since I live so far away from her, I would have to do this one the phone... which pains me. How do I bring this up while not being able to be there for her physically? I will be there in 2 months but I fear that will be too late. I don't want to do it on the phone but I don't have any other choice. We are running out of time...

What should I do?

Lastly, fuck you cancer. How are you doing this to my family? My mom is the toughest person I know. When she tore her ACL and MCL they told her she would never ski again and she responded with a big fat fuck you and was back on the slopes the next year! She's been skiing every year since and now spends most of her time in Colorado enjoying the outdoors only to spite the doctors that didn't believe in her. The doctors told her 5 years and she's rounding the corner to 6. They told her it wasn't smart to take on Mount Whitney while recovering from chemo so she said ok, I'll conquer Mount Kilimanjaro! They told her she would never be a lawyer so she became a judge. She has taken everything life could throw at her and thrown it back on fire. She has lived more while battling cancer than most people live in a lifetime just because people are stupid enough to use the words ""you"" and ""can't"" in her presence. She is rubber. Bounces right back up. It is so hard to see how chemotherapy cripples this powerful person. To stand by knowing that there is nothing you can do, watching this shadow of a person I love do the things she used to do with so much energy and vigour. I wish I could do more to help you. I wish I could give you my energy in exchange for your pain. You have given me so much in exchange for so little. And now this abomination called cancer is robbing us of the most valuable gift in the whole universe, time.

Once again, sorry for the long post. I had a lot to get off my chest.

TL;DR: mom's got cancer. Chemo round three coming up, how do I talk to her about her options while I live so far away?"
SuB2007,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4x12br,5,d6bymg0,"I am very sorry for your loss. 

I promise you, though, the doctor didn't do anything out of malice, or laziness, or any lack of fight.

The truth is, if her tumor didn't respond to radiation, it is very possible that it also wouldn't have responded to chemotherapy. It is also worth remembering that chemotherapy is really hard on the body...it can make you sick and miserable and in some cases can kill you (or allow you to get infections that will kill you) before the cancer does. These two things, combined with the size of the tumor and your mother's existing state of mental and physical deterioration probably led the doctor to believe that palliative care in hospice was the best choice. Doctors are supposed to ""do no harm,"" and if your mothers condition was poor and unlikely to improve then taking steps to prolong he life in a very painful manner might have been interpreted as the more harmful option.

I would really suggest you see a grief counselor about this. They will help you come to terms with what happened and deal with the pain that you are very obviously feeling.

I don't know your exact medical situation is, but if you haven't seen a mental health professional (I did, helped me) I would consider it before making any drastic choices. 

I took buckets of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs as per my psychiatrist, esp during my stem cell transplant. Helped me plenty. YMMV, but I'd consider it if you haven't tried it yet. Regardless of anything else, anti-depressants may increase your quality of life. IDK, talk to a mental health professional.

----

Even if terminal (IDK a thing about brain cancer mind you so I'm not saying it is, **at all**), there are palliative administrations/dosages of chemo too, to prevent further pain from the further spread of the disease. The tumor itself can often result in extremely painful consequences. The location of my tumor mass on my superior vena cava nearly killed me, caused extreme difficulty breathing and left the right half of my body swollen with clots. I walked into the ER coughing blood. I figured I was probably going to die. It was painful. Very, very painful.

So even if opting to let the natural progression of things to take its course, complete discontinuation may be ill-advised in favor of palliative versus curative therapy. IDK. Again YMMV. And I am no way saying this is that, I don't know a thing about your specific illness or brain cancer so it varies tremendously.

My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in November and he got weaker because of chemo--the radiation actually made him feel better--but other than that he was his jolly old self up until February. He had an amazing palliative care nurse, and that is super important because some palliative care professionals think their job is to usher people to death's door, but the good ones know their job is to manage pain and symptoms so the patient can stop thinking about how painful it is and instead think about how they can fight their fight and keep living. 

As far as treatment goes, get the tumor genes sequenced and tested for a particular mutation that might qualify your mom for a drug called Keytruda. I met a woman who had what was essentially a death sentence four years ago, got in on this drug's clinical trial, and has been in remission ever since. Not everyone qualifies for it, but you should push hard to make sure if your mom does qualify she gets in. 

Finally, know that even if your mom doesn't make it, you still have time to make her happy. Dig out old photo albums and anything that might be a happy memory. Save voicemails from her now, because I realized after my dad was gone I only had one sixteen second clip of his voice. Take videos and photos and keep making happy memories with her, because a happy patient can fight harder and better than a depressed patient.

missamanda1295,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4xasti,2,d6fcm2o,"First, I'm so sorry this happened to you and your family. My dad died of pancreatic cancer about 3 years ago within 3 months of diagnosis nearly identical to your moms. Don't get too freaked out yet, my dad's case was particularly aggressive. I'm a cancer biologist, so I'll do my best to explain what's happening here, in case that helps (it helped me). Oversimplification, but the details aren't important here.

We treat cancer by targeting what causes cells to grow out of control. Pancreatic cancer is, **in general,** far more aggressive than lots of other kinds of cancer (breast, prostate, etc). Pancreatic cancer most often has a mutation in a particular gene that encodes a protein which is extremely hard to target with drugs. (Although this gene is mutated in lots of other kinds of cancer, it's been thought that it is the main player in Pancreatic cancer). Other kinds of cancer are driven by mutations in other genes which produce proteins that are far easier to target (the most famous example, Her2/herceptin). That doesn't leave a lot of treatment options for Pancreatic cancer that are specific to the actual cancer cells. Instead, it can be treated with drugs that nonspecifically target fast dividing cells (so not just cancer cells) which cause the horrible side effects of chemo and radiation.

Pancreatic cancer also has a rather unfortunate physiology which is not well understood, that consists of a relatively recently discovered tissue type and essentially a barrier around the cancer that makes drug delivery difficult. 

I'm a hardcore scientist and I believe in what I do, but science and numbers are wrong all the time. But if that's what you want to know, the numbers are not in your favor. People generally do better after surgical removal of the cancer (usually a Whipple), but when the cancer has already spread, removal of the cancer isn't intended to treat the disease as much as it is to keep the patient more comfortable by unblocking bile ducts, etc.

My dad went in for a Whipple, they found a met, and it turned into palliative care at that point. The surgery itself made my dad super weak, unable to eat, lots of pain, and his life was miserable. He told me he wanted to die at the end. So that is my bias. The vast majority of other people have better experiences.

My advice is to enjoy every moment that you get. Take lots of pictures. I hope that you get lots and lots more of those moments than I did.

It's weird, because unlike chemo the extreme hard nausea isn't there blocking eating, but it's still hard to want to eat anything and I just have no appetite really.

How long did it take some of you to get over this? I just feel like a weak slug now and want it to go away so I actually feel normal. Also I can barely do any exercise without getting extremely short of breath (I think a bit of radiation might have irritated my lungs so I hope that goes away because it's hard to breath in deeply without coughing instantly.)

I guess unlike some of my ""easier"" chemos where you start feeling better after a week or so once you get rid of the disgusting chemicals in your body this is different. I know it physically damaged cells in my chest so it's a very different experience recovering from it. "

http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer

As far as what to expect, it depends on the type of pancreatic cancer (and location of mass in proportion to the pancreas), as well as any palliative treatments. 

From my experience (father with stage 4 adenocarcinoma, tumor wrapped around main artery, no surgeries, 8 rounds of FOLFIRINOX, then some number of gemcitabine, and finally an oral chemo) - the chemo extended his life by a great deal. his symptoms were different (mainly stomach pain). The first chemo helped with the stomach pain as it shrunk the tumors, but ultimately they grew back. There was a study i read up on the treatment, and survival/recurrence rates &amp; timeframe were almost exactly the same for him as noted in the study.

I would suggest talking to the doctor (should be anyway with those symptoms - especially jandice which could indicate more issues with the bile duct) about what to expect depending on the treatment chosen.

If no treatment, it could be a slow deterioration, to the point of being immobile and needing hospice - within weeks to months. Or it could be quick, and without warning.

my advice, make sure all finances/legal docs are in order. then, be there to support your wife with whatever she needs - does she need a shoulder? does she need you to take on more household responsibilities temporarily? everyone processes stress differently.

Most likely it will be a hard road, the thing to keep in mind is the FIL.

rewardiflost,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4ycl27,11,d6mobxo,"I've known 3 people with pancreatic cancer.   

Once they reach the stage where jaundice and dark urine sets in, things are pretty far.   The staging is handled differently by different facilities...  the jargon I'm used to hearing now includes whether or not it has spread (metastasized).   That isn't definite from what you said here.   

In 2 out of the 3 cases,  the patient died within 6 months after initial diagnosis.  My late wife was diagnosed after being relatively free of symptoms, just some back pain that was going on for several months.   She died 8 weeks after the initial diagnosis.   
The 3rd person fought for a little over 2 years, and just passed last week.   

These were all strong, relatively healthy women in their 40s. 

The fact that your FIL's doctor has recommended nothing but palliative care indicates that there is no good treatment option.  
I'd expect that things will only go downhill.   Probably rather quickly.  

At the end, I brought my wife home.   She was on a pain machine (self-administered morphine) in addition to other drugs to help make her more comfortable.     As the disease progressed, she slept more, ate less, and required more pain medication.   
For the last 3 or 4 days, she was barely lucid even when appearing wide awake.   She lost a lot of weight, and was in constant pain.   She even needed oxygen to help with breathing, and assistance just to turn over in bad.  

I think she was happier to die at home with me than to have passed inside a hospital or other facility.   
It wasn't easy.   It tore me up every day to see her dying in front of me, but I kept my tears inside.    Family members offered to help give me breaks so I could sleep or get things done;   they were afraid to be alone with her.     I was annoyed, but I understand how people don't like to be around death.    
Those last couple of weeks were pretty much a 24/7 crisis, when she did wake up for a little while, I tried to feed her, clean her up, and tend to her pain.   I didn't sleep much.   
Two years later, I'm still shaken by it - but doing a lot better than I was after the initial shock.   

You know your family situation, but if it is anything like mine - expect your wife to stay by his bedside for the last days.   Also expect her to be devastated for quite a while after.   The initial grief can be blunted a little by the shock of it happening.  It took me a couple months to actually let it all sink in.   

If you can, make sure all of his paperwork is in order, and see about funeral arrangements.   Let the less-close family members know this is the end, so they can come and say goodbye if they want.   
Do everything you can to free up your wife so she can spend time with her Dad...  and after he passes, she may need some time to sort things out.   Grief counseling / support groups might be useful after the shock wears off.  

I'm sorry you and your family have to go through this. 

PS - when my wife passed, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network [PANCAN](https://www.pancan.org/) was somewhat informative for me.   They also had an open request for samples of tumors - there was a contact page with info about the surgeon/doctor and how to share samples with them...  if you and your family are inclined to do that sort of thing.

Since its stage III, it is inoperable and is too close to certain vessels, where you wouldn't be able to resect all the cancer.  It will progress to stage IV if and when they discover it has metastasized to another organ, the most common of which would be the liver, which is just a few inches from the pancreas.    
  
Sometimes the cancer can erode into the duodenum or stomach (parts of the digestive track) which causes bleeding.  This is the likely cause of the bloody stools.  As he bleeds more, he'll become dependent on transfusions to prevent becoming anemic (symptoms include shortness of breath, fast heart rate, fatigue).

ref_,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_4yhenm,10,d6nt8px,"Really sorry to hear about your sister, it must be extremely hard at such a young age and so shocking. 

Palliative care is a term for care given to people to ease their symptoms, but not to treat the underlying illness. It doesn't directly mean end of life care, as you can be have palliative care in conjunction with treatment. However in your sisters case it sounds like this is purely end of life care. 

It involves painkillers, usually quite strong, to easy pain symptoms, and possibly anti emetics and stuff like that. I don't know where you are from, but at least here in the UK it will involve mental health support in the form of counselling, and planning stuff like funerals. In short it's to make the rest of your life as comfortable as possible. Macmillan might have some more detailed information if you wish (or the NHS website, http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/end-of-life-care/Pages/what-it-involves-and-when-it-starts.aspx)

Things I learned in the last 3 months:

- Get to know the type of cancer including pathology results, it helps to prepare.  Do not assume healthcare providers will tell you everything.  My mom's cancer is rare, aggressive, difficult to treat, and has a high rate of recurrence.

- If willing, stay on top of hospital tasks.  Speed is important.  In her case they were slow to start treatment and also made a mistake in appointment scheduling that would have cost a couple weeks.

- If she is open to it, be ready to talk about anything and everything.  I regret not being strong enough to talk about death when my mom tried to bring up the subject.

- If being cared for at home, don't wait until the caregiver is exhausted before getting extra support.

- Be prepared to track many things throughout the day: meds, pain, fluids/food, bowel movements, etc.

Find a doctor that is willing to help her fight. Assuming she wants to. If she doesn't want to, that is her choice and you need to accept that.

I was fortunate that my ureters were not compromised, so I didn't require any stents and have had no issues there, but I did have my iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes involved. 

What is your mother's treatment plan? As a point of comparison, I had:

7 rounds of cisplatin - 1x a week for 7 weeks.
67 total radiation treatments - 30 abdominal and 28 pelvic, a boost of 5 high dose pelvic, and 4 internal brachytherapy treatments. 
8 rounds of Carboplatin/taxol/Avastin. 
Am still on avastin - I've had 35 total treatments. 

I am basically in remission - my pelvis is clear, the nodes are reduced to normal. Lung nodules still there, but stable for almost 3 years now. 

Unfortunately, though, this is likely to be what kills me. I've managed to buy some time which I'm really happy about, because I have kids still in high school.  

I don't want to offer you any false hope - her diagnosis and stage are bad, but you know that. Contrary to what monkeybubba below said, palliative care doctors are going to be her best friends. All a palliative care dr does is treat her symptoms and try to make her as comfortable as possible. That's a good thing - cervical cancer and especially ureter involvement are painful as crap. She'll need the help. It isn't hospice - she can continue to get treatment while also receiving palliative care.

Unfortunately, the treatment options are limited, and she'll be further constrained by what her kidneys can handle. Sadly, she *is* terminal - you didn't say when your birthday is but I hope it's a while away. Spend as much time with her as you can, help her make decisions, and make sure she knows you're ok with whatever she decides. Even if you're not. This is going to be hard on everyone.

My family did not go the hospice route mainly because of difference in philosophy and concern with their caregiving.  But, I've heard positives from friends' experiences.

My area Toronto also has home-based hospice care but it maxes out around 50 hours per month (personal support worker, nurse) unless hiring out of pocket.

We went with palliative care in a hospital and they are pretty good.

Some suggestions for both:

- Apply early as bed space can fill quickly.

- If interested in a private room, apply early as they are in demand.  Ask for criteria for getting access.  Ward rooms (3+ beds per room) are quite noisy and bustling.

- Stay on top of nurses/doctors, they are overloaded.  Patients need someone to speak up for them, even if it's for routine/ordered care.

- Take advantage of other services that might be offered, such as music therapy, chaplains, etc.  They can be quite wonderful.

- Hospitals may have reduced parking rates for palliative/long term care patients/caregivers.

My parents have been together for 45 years, since they were 19 years old. My poor dad has been crying so much. He admitted to me that he's having suicidal thoughts, and he's asking for help. I've never seen him like this. He doesn't have the greatest support system. He has friends who are coworkers, but they're not like bosom buddies. His parents are long gone, and his sisters are scattered across the country. My brother's a mess in his own right. I'm not going to say I'm a beacon of sanity, but I'd say I have it the most together of anyone at this moment. 

The hospital social worker and the palliative care people are great for my mom's needs but inadequate for my dad's. Support groups once a month? A referral to a grief counselor? I firmly believe (and my father agrees) that he needs daily psychiatric care for the foreseeable future.

He is still going to work half-time, which is good, but at night we've both been unable to sleep and he just sits on the couch motionless and afraid. I don't want to hospitalize him; that would rob him of some of the time he has left to be with my mom.

nahpuckyoumiss,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_586w8l,2,d8y1w5d,"Hi there,

My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, with mets in his stomach &amp; liver. They tried to stop/slow down the spread with chemo, then radiation and Dad was also taking alternate therapy (his choice). After the radiation did not work (in fact, the cancer had slowly spread further), he was switched to palliative care (quality of life treatment). This meant making him comfortable in his last months and ensuring he was able to say/do all of the things he could. He was 70 and unfortunately the chemo and radiation had taken its toll, so he wasn't particularly lucid by the time he was under palliative care. He had 6 months between being diagnosed and passing away.

So that's the background. 

I can't tell you want to do or how to feel, and neither can anyone else. It's a really ugly, messy time for you (regardless of how emotionally and mentally strong someone can be, watching your parent slowly die can and will absolutely tear you apart).

I can tell you how *I* felt; everything. I felt everything and nothing. I live in another country. I flew back around 15-20 times to spend as much as I could with him. I regret to this day not quitting work and moving back to look after him (for many reasons).

I don't know the relationship you have with your Dad. Mine used to be super complicated and then in the last 5/6 years of his life, we were best friends. It's been nearly 18 months since he passed, and I would give *anything* to have him back. He was meant to see me get married to the only man he ever approved of and be a doting grandfather to my future children. 

Sorry. I made this about me. But what I want you to take away from this is to spend as much time as possible with your Dad, and your family.

civiljoe,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_5avstx,3,d9k0wlg,"Going through chemo a second time. My advice is to separate out the quackery into the useful and junk heaps. My take on this:

*Any treatment plan is carefully personalized. Don't think you need to take something or not take something because someone else does/does not.

*Medicinal herbs require clearance from your oncologist. I was told to stop aspirin as it interacts poorly with my treatment. Include in this category super concentrated capsules like green tea or cranberry. 

*Hydration. I'm a bigger guy, so I drink at least 2 liters of filtered water a day, sometimes more after IV chemo. I'm mixing in a little ginger soda as I type this. Far and away, hydration brings me the most temporary comfort.

*Probiotics. I started making and drinking kefir (it's like yogurt) and it seems to help my digestion. If your wife is lactose intolerant and can't take yogurt, try kefir. Kefir is milk, fermented. Since the lactose is consumed by the SCOBY, it has very low to nil lactose remaining.

*Nutrition. Chemo and just the stress of treatment is hard on the body. If you want complimentary care, see a nutritionist. Magnesium/potassium as well as B complex becomes important. There was a mega-study done a few years ago that proved vitamin pills really don't work. The body needs to extract nutrients from foods. I am relatively lucky in that I can keep food down and it dampens my nausea. If she has a smart phone, I recommend installing and using MyFitnessPal. It's a calorie counter, but also can track nutrients, water intake, and exercise calorie balance. It's also got a vast database of foods and can add to the diary by UPC code.

*Cooking. I know what it's like to be stuck at home with nothing to do. If your wife can run a stove and food doesn't make her ill, then cooking is a good diversion. It's also a great way for her to control her nutrition.

*Homeopathic remedies are diluted to a point where they do not work. There is also no evidence that they actually work. I have family that works for pharma, mostly in drug approvals. If Homeopathy really worked, don't you think that every big drug company would be getting FDA approval to sell diluted water for an insane markup? The reason why you don't see that is because it doesn't work. If a crystal pyramid makes her smile, then all right.

*Palliative care. Ask your oncologist for referrals to see an acupuncturist, massage therapist, etc. Your insurance may cover it if it's coded as palliative care. 

*Mental health. I'd also recommend a therapist. Again, if insurance will cover it then it can be an excellent way to just vent. A therapist is an expert at breaking down a problem into it's root causes, and as a neutral party help examine what the real issues are. Family cannot do that for your wife. 

*Exercise. Mall walking, shopping, nature trails, ironman, whatever. I find if I don't push myself during the day that I can't sleep at night and feel worse the next day. 

*Hobbies. I am lucky that my vocation (civil engineer) is compatible with sitting around during recovery. Your wife may want to pick up a hobby, and they are a good distraction.

I had an NG tube at one point to suction my stomach because I was so nauseous, but this is pretty extreme. For pain, good ol' morphine was key. Some people use dilauded, fentanyl, etc. If she experiences neuropathy, they should offer gabapentin. But really, her doctors should be on top of this. The main thing I would stress is for you to help her advocate to always keep her pain and nausea controlled. There is almost always another med to try if what she is using isn't working.

",t3_5hsg5t,,2016-12-11 23:17:49,,,Mum has zero interest in living,"Hello there, 

I am looking for some help and advice. My mother, who is 67, lives in Ireland and was diagnosed with kidney cancer in the summer with secondaries on the pelvic bone. This was only discovered after a scan which followed a cardiac arrest in the spring - her illness came out of the blue for everyone. Since then, she has quickly deteriorated. Not so much physically - although she has lost weight and suffers from a lot of pain - but mentally she is confused, irrational, aggressive and withdrawn.

She is on morphine to manage the pain from calcaemia, but she is also drinking a lot. We are all aware of the dangers of drinking in her condition - least of all combining it with morphine.

She will think nothing of screaming at my dad in a place if he refuses to buy wine. She says vile and nasty things to him - almost on a daily basis, and randomly flips at him. 

She has little appetite and what she does eat is mainly sweet things like pudding - and of course a few bottles of wine. She is tiny, 45kg was her last weight, she was probably nearly double this ten years ago.

My dad is on his own with her in Ireland - me and my other siblings live away and can only manage the odd trip every few weeks. This is a massive burden to my Dad and he is struggling to cope. Our experience of the health service in Ireland is not great - not a criticism of the doctors and nurses, just the system is terrible - lots of appointments have been misbooked or unnecessary (nearest hospitals are one hour and three and a half hours away so this is a big journey for someone in her condition.)

She has refused all treatment, so all she is receiving is palliative care.

We are resigned to her dying, but the way she is going is painful, very stressful and very upsetting. We are feeling a lot of guilt for not being there enough and my Dad is feeling helpless and hopeless and completely on his own.

I am wondering if anyone knows of any help or support my parents can recieve in this situation to deal with her mental incapacity, aggression and my dad's role as sole carer?

Thanks in advance.

She has a local palliative care team, but she objects to them, considers them patronising and condescending (they're not, her state of mind thinks they are though), so it's a brittle relationship between her and them. They persevere, but only insomuch that they give her painkillers, check her bloods etc.
There doesn't seem to be any mental health care. It's a tricky one.
My Dad confessed to my sister last night that he is feeling suicidal and if he had a shotgun, he'd turn it on himself. It's pretty grim, and I feel that her death would be a terrific relief for everyone. That makes me feel terrible.",t3_5hsg5t,,2016-12-12 20:02:17,,,,

If your dad is in stage 4 cancer pain, he might want to consider seeing a specialist like a Palliative care doctor, or a pain management doctor. There *are* medication regimens out there that will help him, he just has to find it. Also, surprisingly enough, I had one thing that worked very well and wasn't a narcotic -- IV tylenol.  

the doctors will always err on the side of caution when they write scripts for pain medicine - they will always put a lower dose on it and see if that works - if it doesnt work the patient tells them and they should adjust the dose to a higher one that works, or tell them they can take 2, etc.",t3_5i0mzs,,2016-12-13 08:09:15,,,,
cabiem,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_5i2bsj,2,db66vm4,"I am sorry to hear about all the loss and problems in your family. That you are fried is understandable. You have major grief from the loss of your mom, anticipatory grief about the eventual loss of your dad, you are then having to take care of a parent when you likely wish they could emotionally help take care of you... it is exhausting. He is likely struggling with both the cancer diagnosis and the loss of his wife. Both are emotional earthquakes. For you. For him. Both of you need help. 

1) as you know stage 4 cancer is incurable and no treatment will change that. It might give more time, but the question then is at what cost? This is a decision your dad needs to make. I have one aunt who quit treatment after 2 recurrences, one part way into chemo on her second recurrence (both were stage 4 when they stopped) and used hospice at home for help, support, etc. and to die more comfortably. 

It sounds like his new chemo is working to shrink the tumors. Hopefully that will give him a decent remission. At a point with you are not emotionally exhausted have a talk with him about what he wants to do when the cancer comes back and/or he stops responding to treatment. Have a similar talk with the oncologist - what kind of death is this going to be, how do you decide at what point to stop chemo, etc. This is a hard conversation and some oncologists need their feet nailed to the floor to keep them in the room long enough to answer questions like that.

2) as for a referral to hospice and talk to them about what they offer (they deal with the entire family, not just the patient), at what point are they appropriate, etc. That you call them does not mean you will be using them right now, but it is worth finding out what the options are before you need them.

3) palliative care is not aimed at a cure (which there will not be one in his case as he is stage 4) but is aimed at making someone's remaining days more comfortable. It can include chemo, etc. to shrink tumors to make someone more comfortable... or not. That may or may not be appropriate in the future. That would be another thing to ask about.

4) With respect to your emotional exhaustion - find time to do things you want to do. Perhaps there is a caregiver group you can join and then talk openly about resentment, emotional pain, exhaustion... in a setting where you won't be judged and your dad won't overhear you. Get someone else to help out at home. That is where the social worker at the cancer facility would be worth talking to for suggestions. Perhaps a in home health worker might help. If you are a church member ask for help - maybe someone can bring dinners, sit with your dad, watch him for you so you can go out, clean the house, do laundry... usually people don't know how they can help so they don't. You have to take any opening someone gives you and suggest ways you can use help - tell them you'd really appreciate it if they'd do X or if they can't do that then Y. You might find it helpful to talk with a grief counselor. You also sound depressed and being treated for depression might help.

5) Talk with the social work department and ask them what kind of help is available for your dad and for you as caretaker. You need a break. You need to have a day off, time with your friends...

Good luck",t3_5i2bsj,,2016-12-14 03:43:06,,,I need some advice,"Hi everyone, this is my first post after stumbling on r/cancer today. I've been reading some of the posts here and as the sole caregiver of a cancer patient I'm really heartened to see so many people here still maintaining their positive attitude and outlook despite some really shitty circumstances. If possible I'll like some input (preferably from caregivers but everyone is welcome &lt;3) on my situation.  
  
I'm going to be straightforward and just say it: I'm tired AF. My dad was diagnosed with stage 3 upper GI cancer in May this year. And that is just 5 months after my mom passed away suddenly from a stroke. My dad went for a surgery immediately and had the tumor removed, but he's lost a lot of weight that he never gained back. He started chemo a little later than planned as he wasn't recovering well after surgery (he's on his 3rd cycle now, on Xelox), but when he started the chemo the cancer was already back (indicators were high, he had a PET scan that showed some glowing areas, spread to nodes near neck area), so technically he's stage 4 now. He's scheduled for another PET scan right before his 4th cycle, so I'll probably consult about his life expectancy then. The cancer cells have responsed well to the chemo, indicators are pretty much back to normal from blood tests but we should see.  
  
  
On top of weight loss he also lost much of his appetite (as they removed part of his stomach along with the tumor) so it was really difficult trying to get him to eat. His memory also deteriorated, perhaps both from the lack of nutrition and trauma from the surgery and his diagnosis; he was often very out of it, sleepy and lethargic, generally showing lack of interest in a lot of things, things that he used to like doing. I've been to a dietician but having a diet plan doesn't work when he refused to stick to it and/or forgets his meals. I'm not around to take care of him in the day as I have to work, so he's usually alone at home.  
  
    
I've talked to him about him not eating or being uninterested in general, like ask him if there's anything he really wants to do or eat, whether he's feeling ok, physically and mentally, but he just doesn't talk. I've also told him how I feel about him and his current situation, about how worry I am about him, how everyone is worried about him, but it just doesn't stick for him. It's really frustrating and depressing for me to come back and realised that he's skipped breakfast, or his supplements, or his medications, despite so many written and phone call reminders. At first I gave him the benefit of doubt, that he really is just forgetting things because of his bad memory, but nowadays it feels like an excuse, because he knows that his memory is bad and yet he's not doing anything to try and mitigate the effects. I feel like I'm just fighting an uphill battle with a person who doesn't want to take responsibility for his own life, and that it's very contradicting to me that I have the responsibility to take care of his schedules and needs, but I don't have the right to decide for him what are the things he should do that are beneficial to him. And I just feel like I'm putting in efforts for nothing as the outcome isn't good and I'm just getting burnout in the process. I'm also not sure how to feel about the reverse role, that I now have to be the strict and responsible parent to my dad who has regress to a child. I know that I should be understanding and not be resentful, but I just can't take it anymore; it's like knowing there's nothing I can do further to make sure that he really stick to his meals and medication schedule, but that knowledge does not make me worry less. On really depressing days I just wish it can end quickly for him so that he doesn't have to continue with his meaningless days and I can finally get out of this living hell and move on with rebuilding my life.  
  
So I guess what I wanted was to ask if anyone has experienced/is experiencing something like this right now, and what did you do to make the situation better, or cope? I understand that everyone's methods are different but I just wanted something to work on, I don't think I can just sit and do nothing while watching my dad just waste himself away; and on a selfish note, it also makes the things I gave up a lot harder to justify.

I also think it is a good thing to bring up end-of-life issues early on.  Too many of us don't really know what our loved ones want near the end.

JamaicanGinger,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_5iwp0u,2,dbbvhvu,"Since others have pointed out the difference between palliative and hospice care, I'll add something else. My partner has stage IV breast cancer that is highly treatable meaning she'll have cancer for (hopefully) many years as a chronic disease. Women can live for over a decade with her cancer. Well, not all doctors know this and when she's been in the hospital, I've had a couple doctors ask if we've considered hospice care. I was so upset and confused when it happened the first time, not to mention so scared. 

It turns out the doctors just hear late-stage cancer and don't really understand that there are curable and treatable cancers. I told my partners oncologist and he was so angry that some hospital doctor (and this is a hospital literally connected by a long hallway to a top 10 cancer center) traumatized us so much by making it sound like my partner was at the end when all she had was something minor. That was a year ago and now my partner is in remission with no active cancer and may be for years to come. 

Also, since my partners cancer is considered a chronic disease, she does have a palliative care doc who is great.

She's been diagnosed with stage 4 DLBCL Lymphoma and her blood pressure went very very low. A bunch of doctors came and gave her IV fluids and meds to take the blood pressure up to a level where it was still low but not directly life threatening. This was most likely due to internal bleeding because of a surgery she had 2 days ago, or because of an infection as the doctor said. A few hours after that a doctor came from the ""palliative"" care team. I was shocked when he introduced himself because I knew that palliative care is mostly only brought up for people that are relatively close to their death. This was very scary yet confusing for me because the cancer that my mother has is very curable and has cure rates of up to 70%, even at the later stages. So when the doctor came and asked us questions regarding quality or quantity of life and brought up life support machines, I just got very frightened. Could the team just be unaware that my mom has a good chance of getting cured? We talked to her oncologist and she said that my mother will be fine and she is already on the road to a cure, but I am just confused at why the palliative care team would come. Sorry if this is a stupid question, it was just a really shocking and emotional moment for me at the time, but why do you guys think the palliative care team became involved in my mothers case? Thank you and sorry for the long read and any grammatical errors."

Five year survival rate for NSCLC - Adenocarcinoma with mets (stage IV) is 1%.   So with lung cancer appearing in the kidney, prognosis isn't good. So exercising and diet are my best options for now. 

For me Palliative Care would make the most sense when it gets to that point. 

$12,500 is my annual out of pocket.  Doctor visits (specialist) have a $50 copay, but once I have maxed my out of pocket cost that drops to $0.     I still have to pay medicine copays.  None are cancer related at this time.

JamaicanGinger,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_5ksdeu,4,dbqehx9,"My partner and I have had two palliative care experiences. The first was at the local hospital where she was diagnosed. The palliative care dr there was mainly concerned with her quality of life. He offered her a lot of comfort meds (pain, anxiety, nausea, etc). He was excellent at getting to the bottom of any discomfort she had (usually medication side effects) and fixing the problem. He was a really nice guy but we switched hospitals and were informed that his overuse of some meds (mainly steroids) was not very helpful for her long term goals. His mindset was always on her short term comfort so while she felt great on his meds, they were not at all in her best interest even though she felt great.

After switching to a cancer center, we got a new palliative care dr. She's nice as well but manages the meds a bit more conservatively. She refills meds on a 30 day basis to make sure no changes need to be made. At one point, my partner was sleeping 18 hours a day so she prescribed Ritalin at our request and now she's awake and alert for 18 hours a day. She's not the best at getting to the bottom of why my partner has nausea or other issues, but she offers meds to make sure the discomfort is as minor as possible.  

Overall, both have been really helpful in their own way and I can't imagine making it through the last year without their expertise. They keep my partner having as little depression, anxiety, pain, or nausea as possible. They understand so much about how different medications react to each other and they are also really good at getting to know the patient individually to know if they tend to be sensitive to meds or can handle larger doses. 

I also find that they take a bit more time to get to know the whole picture which is what we needed. Individual drs, like the oncologist, the neurologist, the primary care dr, all have different opinions based on their speciality and the palliative care doctor looks at the whole picture, the individual patient, and helps coordinate everything and make sure the patient isn't lost in a maze of meds, side effects, or symptoms. I highly recommend at least a consult and be honest and just ask them what they can offer your father.

She was in pretty bad shape when she was diagnosed, extremely weak, and the bone mets were leaching calcium into her blood.  The calcium was so high her kidneys were failing.  She had lots of fluid around the lungs, and heart.  So while she also had difficulty breathing, it was also putting strain on the heart.

She eventually got strong enough to get herself up from bed to a walker to get to the bathroom.  She had no appetite which I guess is a side effect of the tumor. 

Even though the doctor told them how bad this was, and there was no good outcome, they both insisted on 'fighting' it.  She had several radiation treatments to shrink the tumor, which were successful.  This was more palliative to allow her to breathe easier.  They both insisted on chemo.
Once they thought she may have been strong enough she had one round of low grade chemo.  She wasn't strong enough for it.  She got weaker by the day.  What little she was eating before was even less after.  She would eat only one bite of a scrambled egg a day.  She only made it another 2 weeks after.

As to what to expect.  She got more and more tired.  She didn't sleep well.  The difficulty in breathing kept her agitated at night.  Knowing she was terminal caused a lot of anxiety.  

The one thing I would have tried to change is to get hospice involved as early as possible.  My parents saw hospice as 'raising the white flag'.  Use it if it's available.  No they aren't there to fix your mom, but she doesn't have to be actively dying for them to help.

Ah, yes, I read your post yesterday about the surgeries that you hope for. I hope I did not confuse you with somebody else. They hope to take out some tumors and cut the blood vessel to the others, right? And then get the others out later?

I had a hepatectomy in 2013 and I recovered quite well from it. I hope that you will be able to get the surgeries and that you will recover quickly too. If surgery is not an option, maybe a radiological treatment is? I had an RFA (radio frequency ablation) for my liver mets in September. Maybe you could ask them about something like that.

Yeah, stopping chemo is not an option really. Well, it is if the side effects get too rough. At some point, when treatment is only palliative, quality of life has to be considered too. But, as of now, I want to give the Stivarga a shot. 

I was wondering why you asked about the liver together with breathing. :) I'm glad you don't feel anything from the tumors. It was like that for me for a long time too. Except for one tumor that was close to a muscle in my butt. :D It hurt when I was standing up and especially when I was walking. Radiation took care of that.

Liver failure is hard. First for me went the ability to tolerate fats, then the ability to regulate body temperature, I relied on ambient temperatures for my body regulation. So be mindful of the ambient temperature and giving her the ability to adjust quickly if needed. Layers of blankets, hot water bottles, cold spray bottles, whatever your climate demands. 

It's painful too. The morphine is necessary and will mostly control it. mornings will be hardest, last nights analgesia will have been metabolised overnight, you should be given liquid morphine for breakthrough pain, it'll take 15 minutes or so to work and will cover her till the longer acting painkillers kick in. 

If she's reticent or unable to admit to pain (some of us are when we're feeling really vulnerable) look for sweat as a first clue to pain, that's a morphine dissipating  effect and an indicator of pain. assess from there, always get the morphine in her sooner rather than later. The more she has time to get worked up into that pain the worse it is, the harder to suppress it.  treat it asap, you'll have to keep escalating the doses of analgesia, the palliative team will have that covered. 

If it's kidney, she may end up with bladder problems and will be catheterised, that's a real relief, or was for me. Get that done if your medical team thinks it may help.

Toileting was the biggest problem. He had just enough awareness left to insist that he die at home.

scrabs1000,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6248tj,9,dfjugl9,"I'm really sorry to hear about this. Metastatic stomach cancer is a devastating condition, particularly when it affects the ability to eat or drink.

First, I would revisit the oncologist, or see another one. There are numerous treatments for widespread stomach cancer. While they cannot cure the disease, they may provide meaningful symptomatic benefit for your father. By that I mean they might make him feel better. Of course, you need to be fit to receive treatments like chemotherapy, otherwise they can just make things worse.

Second, it sounds like he needs to see a palliative care physician. Nobody with cancer should ever be left to waste away at home on an iv with no additional support. Palliative care directly treats the symptoms of cancer, which become increasingly important as the disease advances. I would ask your oncologist about this, or alternatively your family physician.

Finally, most stomach cancer patients benefit from a review with a dietitian. They can provide information and assistance with appropriate nutritional supplementation. Rarely they may advise tubes that bypass the obstructing tumor, either via the nose (nasojejunal tubes) or through the skin (jejunostomy tubes). However, this is usually only appropriate if a patient is likely to undergo an operation.

In all advanced malignancy there comes a time when forced feeding or even hydration is inappropriate. This happens when the body is shutting down slowly before death, and such patients will not desire any food or drink. It does not sound like this is the case for your father. Instead, you have described a mechanical obstruction. Overcoming this somehow may make him feel better.

RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dfzrq5v,1,dg0u7gm,"First, this is a complex, difficult case of two synchronous primary tumors in both lungs in a debilitated woman. 

**I need a little more information. My questions:**

1) How old is your mother? 

2) Can you elucidate what is causing her fatigue? Does she have shortness of breath or lose her breath with exercise related to underlying COPD or heart problems, or is the tumor blocking an airway? Is she just not an active person to begin with? 

3) How much weight did she lose before her diagnosis (malnutrition causes fatigue, and cancer causes malnutrition)?

4) What chemo is she getting? I'm going to assume it is carboplatin and maybe etoposide (VP-16). Possibly immunotherapy, but this is not used in small cell lung cancer off trial. It's ok if you don't know this. Try to answer the above 3 questions succintly.

            
**My replies:**

1) Regarding efficacy (how effective chemo is) of treatment, this has been answered below/above. If she can only get 2 cycles instead of 4 cycles, then the efficacy of chemo is less. Its not the ""ability for the chemo to work,"" more so the 
""intensity of the chemotherapy"" by using repeated cycles, each one killing more cancer cells, which is the important part.

2) She has two very crappy tumors. Small cell lung cancer is very difficult to cure with chemotherapy or with added radiation. Stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer is not curable with chemo alone. In two lungs, adding radiation to both sites is going to make things worse. However, there are times where more focused palliative radiation can improve symptoms (breathing, pain, bleeding). Ask your physician if they think this is the case. Usually, if the tumor is blocking an airway (bronchus) or this is impending, then radiation may help. They would have already referred you though, most likely, if they thought so, though rarely this is missed by a medical oncologist. If she remarkable tolerates chemo and has a lot of shrinkage, you can discuss the option of radiation at some point. We'll remain cautiously optimistic.

3) Chemotherapy is palliative. This means that she could even improve on chemotherapy if her symptoms get better (better breathing if there is airway blockage.) I need the above info to explain if this is likely or not.

4) Sometimes a low dose of steroids can help with energy and appetite, but these are a double edged sword. Over time, they will weaken muscles and put you in worse shape. Its a very temporary intervention. Your mother is probably getting this with her chemo.",t3_642eb7,,2017-04-09 04:31:44,,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dg13m70,1,dg1g2wx,"To summarize, your mother is a 74 year old woman with depression, low activity level, and poor exercise capacity. I think the spinal stenosis, bending of the spine, and osteoporosis play little into things at this stage. Her fatigue is multifactorial and caused primarily by her underlying lung disease (smoking related at least), years of inactivity, and depression with related pain issues.  She has two very crappy tumors that cannot be cured with chemotherapy alone. We need to approach this disease in the context of her underlying health and intention of treatment, which currently sounds like it is as aggressive while maximizing a balance of quality of life and survival benefit (how long she will live.)


&gt;I am concerned that due to her physical state that the chemo will kill her or ruin what life she has left...I am quite shocked that they are even attempting this treatment, I do not want to lose my Mom...

* Her age and other medical problems could make chemo challenging. Low dose/deintensified carboplatin is a fair choice. It's not full intensity chemo but it still has activity. You may be surprised how well she does with it. Sometimes the first 1-3 cycles are child's play; other times people struggle with it from the get go. I would not expect 1 cycle to land her in the hospital. It's worth trying if you and she are motivated for treatment. 
* I think you could talk about getting palliative care involved as well as they are quite good at symptom management.
* If she does well with chemo, radiation may be on the table but your medical oncologist will assess her again in 1-2 months. I wouldn't be too thrilled about doing radiation for her unless she had a remarkable response to chemo, but i would want to look at the scans too before saying so. Decision would be influenced by potential benefit of radiation vs potential harms of radiation. Again, radiation would likely be palliative in intent, maximizing a balance of quality of life from treatment vs side effects, without the intent of cure.

&gt;I will ask about th immunitherapy.

Theres no need to ask about immunotherapy since, again, it is not used for small cell, but you can if you want.

Make sure you are taking care of yourself through all of this. It's normal for the family of an ill person (such as one with cancer) to be under a lot of stress, and it can be helpful to talk to a therapist. You don't need to have something wrong with you to see a psychologist/psychiatrist/social worker, but it can still be helpful to have the support there if you need it. This can be arranged through your primary doctor or the place where your mom is receiving her cancer care.

RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_65o8rd,2,dgd965q,"This is really hard, OP. I hope you are able to make some progress with him and get more information. Obviously, being able to meet with him face to face is going to make a big impression, but it sounds like you haven't seen each other in a long time and maybe don't have a strong relationship due to history or distance? Here are my thoughts:


Imaging: There is no comparison. Has he had prior imaging? This is really unusual for an initial MRI with suspicion for a tumor or known tumor to be done without contrast. We actually don't know his diagnosis unless we have a tissue biopsy and imaging with contrast, as well as a CSF sample, and potentially other studies. I imagine this was done a year ago when he was hospitalized. 

Brainstem gliomas are rare and he would ideally go to a large academic center. Radiation could provide local control for some amount of time depending on dose that can be safely given as well as histology (type) of tumor on pathology.

Therapy: At diagnosis a year ago he may have been potentially a candidate for surgery, radiation, and probably chemotherapy of a sort. If it can all be resected, he could be cured, but I can't give numbers and we don't have the whole story. It could always being something funky like a lymphoma though based on his long history, doesn't sound that way. It's a nasty location and tough to cure but it occasionally can be done. I cannot assess resectability. He needs a neurosurgeon. His general condition being as it is, you'll need a doctor to assess if he could even live through a surgery. Regardless of his treatment options, a palliative care and social work consultation are very much appropriate at this time.


When someone is very desperate, they may begin to listen to reason. It sounds like his overwhelming anxiety about his surgery and potentially strong beliefs in alternative medicine have led him here. Unclear if he has had any consultation with an oncologist (surgeon or otherwise).

As for your questions:

1. You need his permission to get info from his physicians. As suggested, he may allow you to tag along. However, I think your role here is as an observer and supportive family member. He needs to make his own decisions, which he clearly has done to this point; we don't know how he came to those decisions because no one has talked to his physicians except him and whoever he has brought with him.

2. We can't predict this. See above.

3. Yep, we treat them all the time. They present with later stages of disease and are more difficult or impossible to cure. It is almost uniformly related to mental health problems that have gone unaddressed for years or are refractory to treatment (bad bipolar, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, bad personality disorders, or some combinations if things). Occasionally it is a well-informed, well-educated person with bizarre beliefs. It's worth it to be supportive.

People who are bedridden have a tough time tolerating treatment. It also is a marker of how grave their condition is, as you said. While it doesn't sound like he's going to be able to do much in the coming days-weeks-months, there are rare instances where surgery can relieve pressure. I gotta say it doesn't sound good.

Isth-mus,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dgd965q,1,dgglfnh,"Thank you for the comprehensive response RadiationMD. 

Wow. You really hit the nail on the head with everything you wrote. Yes, it's true there is some distance between my brother, myself and really my whole family. He moved to a far away state. He's been living a quite alternative lifestyle and pushes us away when we try to help and that has been hard for my family to deal with. But we still love him and want to help him. 

You're not misreading the report. This was indeed his first MRI. He adamantly refused an MRI during his hospitalization 1 year ago though it was recommended. It was ignorant. Sad. My dad can't stop replaying the thought in his mind... if only he'd have listened to the doctors it could have been spotted sooner and treated. So, there's nothing to compare the MRI to. The dr's have recommended another MRI with contrast as you suggested. I expect he'll be getting that soon but not 100% certain he will get it. Not sure if there's other tests they asked for. 

He met with a very experienced neurosurgeon at the beginning of this week who did NOT recommend surgery or a biopsy. It's actually at a large academic center like you recommended. The neurosurgeon said he's seen 10,000+ MRIs and has seen this before. He recommended radiation oncology. Are you a radiation oncologist? He said radiation would reduce the rate at which symptoms worsen, but not cure his symptoms ( i.e. help him walk again). That's the thing we're all having the biggest trouble with. There's no way to cure him anymore?? Oh god. I wish it could be not a glioma and instead something else like you described (lymphoma?) and maybe that would be treatable. That would be a blessing. I know that's probably unlikely. 

Thank you for suggesting palliative care and social work consultations. I was told we need to get a doctor's prescription to get palliative care so we're going to encourage him to do that. You mentioned in your other post about overruling his medical decisions. We agreed that we couldn't force him to do anything despite our pleas. My brother can think clearly so it's not an option. The only person he brings to his appointments is his wife, but she doesn't think for herself. So the reporting back from her about the medical info they heard and what my brother is thinking is obfuscated. 

We're trying to be supportive. When you talk about the correlation between mental health problems and why some people refuse treatment only to embrace it at a later stage, it makes me wonder. He's seemed to have a troubled mind since college (at least 18 years and also did LSD once in school). But his reasoning for not getting conventional medical help seems to be more like a conscientious objection -- like someone who doesn't due to some strongly held convictions (Bob Marley, Steve Jobs, Christian Scientists, etc.). But my family can't help but wonder if there's some sort of mental health problems that contributed to his very strange beliefs. My dad who has turned out to be right about a lot of his situation thinks he has Borderline Personality Disorder. The symptoms of that diagnosis certainly match a lot of my brother's behaviors. It's so sad--after he met with the neurosurgeon who essentially offered no cure, my brother's reaction was that he now felt ""lost."" That's an emotion found in those dealing with Borderline Personality Disorder. Could it be that his brain tumor affected his mental health / beliefs too? 

I keep obsessing about what the prognosis is, and I know it's strange. I want to know so I can know how to act. I'm trying to figure out when I should visit him. I want to visit now before he loses the ability to communicate. I don't know how long to stay. I won't know what to do while I'm there. I don't want to see him in such a helpless state. That's not how I know him. 

Sorry for the long post. You don't have to answer all my concerns. You just seemed to understand all of this so well. Thanks for the advice and for listening. ",t3_65o8rd,,2017-04-19 09:02:27,,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dgglfnh,2,dgjw90e,"At the end of the day, your brother is going to do what he has always done, which is exactly what he wants. Regardless of whether or not you or I think that is the right thing to do, and we can't know what is right for him for multiple reasons, it's his life. He lives where he does for a reason. See where things go, but he's in bad shape. Your role is going to be supportive, and this does not seem to be a call to action moment where you come in and set everything straight, even if it feels like that's what you need to do right now. 

I don't know if his lost feeling is anything at all unsual for someone given a bleak prognosis. Certainly one with BPD can take things the wrong way, but it's hard to say that unless he was given other options and just totally blew everything off. Even if he has a personality disorder, you're not going to diagnose something now and it's not relevant anyhow to his care which is moving in the palliative direction (and should have been focused on such for many months now, it sounds).

Isth-mus,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dgjw90e,1,dgjxbor,"Yeah, once again you are completely right. He is going to continue to do exactly what he wants. In fact, that's already what he's indicated and leaning towards. A day after the neurosurgeon appointment, he was no longer lost or confused and made up his mind to be adamantly opposed to everything he heard. He's going to continue alternative treatments. He is completely against a feeding tube, which the dr recommended. Highly, highly unlikely he's going to do radiation therapy. 

You're right that my role should be to be supportive and to move care in a palliative direction. And you're right that the notion that he may have BPD -- while a possible way to explain his behavior  -- isn't relevant to any action now and caring for him. 

So as far as taking a supportive role, I understand that it's not for me to set things straight and help him make healthy choices, though deep down I may want to make that happen. I can accept and be supportive of his decision to get alternative treatments. I know that that's very important and core to him. He's not going to change. It makes him feel better and I can be on board with that. 

However, I do think he's in denial about his condition that he's dying. He doesn't accept that it's terminal and hopes to find a magical cure, and gets angry at us if we suggest that his health is indeed very bad. It's hard to be supportive of him being in denial. I'm pretty sure what he wants to do (and would ideally have me support him in) is: 

* him getting a bunch of alternative medicine treatments, focusing on his health
* not talk about or make his health a focal point of conversation 
* have me and my family act as if he's not sick, don't pay extra attention to him anymore than you normally would

I find that hard to accept and support. What all of that means in practical terms is that: he's reluctant to get an extra caretaker to help his wife &amp; family while they are overloaded with the requirements of looking after him; reluctant to get a nurse (i.e. palliative care); focuses so much on himself / getting healthier rather than enjoying whatever quality time he may have left with his kids; keeping his condition pretty close to the vest and not sharing with people who know him and have cared about through his life. I think all of those things are important and will help him, so I want to support him by helping him get those things. 

Any thoughts on caring for him and getting him the things that will support him (caretaker, palliative care, spending time with loved ones, etc.)  when his wishes would probably have me acting in a different manner? ",t3_65o8rd,,2017-04-21 08:02:19,,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dgjxbor,1,dgk8cx1,"Well articulated. Briefly, I think palliative doctor and social work can help with many of your concerns and I can detail that later. His family can advocate for additional help at home. 

Getting him to acknowledge and not skirt the giant elephant in the room is difficult, and a palliative doc may make some ground here at least in understanding what he values and how to achieve those things while not disputing his core beliefs. Most people are willing to entertain an end of life discussion, and you don't need to be at the end of life to discuss it. People tend to slowly come around to the notion of their failing health once they begin confronting it (tests, doctors, treatment, logistical things all influence your interaction with your own health and make it more real and perceptible), but his predilection for denial seems strong. Still, denial is a normal mechanism encountered during an acceptance process. Of course, I'm not a psychiatrist.

I just want to let you know that with your symptoms, it can be hemorrhoids, anal fissure, an STD, even something like a yeast infection in that area could cause all those symptoms.

As for whether it's painful to die from colon cancer, I would imagine it doesn't tickle but I've no idea if or how painful it may be. If someone were in stage 4 and not responding to treatment any longer, or if they only qualified for palliative care, the doctors would make you as comfortable as possible. It's not like they would avoid giving a Stage 4 cancer patient things like anti-anxiety medications, sedatives, and/or strong pain reducers. 

My mom died of uterine cancer and she was conscious until the last 30-40 minutes or so. She seemed peaceful and comfortable and if she had displayed any indication she was not either of those things, the doctor said he would make sure it was nipped in the bud immediately. Through her final weeks, her pain did increase sometimes but she was always given whatever was needed to control it. While they may not like prescribing medications such as these to an otherwise healthy individual, they are not shy about doing so for terminal cancer patients.",t3_68b8ag,,2017-04-29 19:57:47,,,,

My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer about 9 months ago. We got second and third opinions and all were generally the same. She needed chemotherapy and if successful (and they were positive about it) followed by surgery and probably radiation. I was like ""we have a plan!""

My wife, bless her heart, abruptly decided there would be no chemotherapy and began, with her sister, to seek out alternative therapy. The leeches are out there so she found them. An MD that told her chemo would kill her and he had other therapies.

Most of these therapies are palliative for patients that are on chemo. They can, from what I have read, help with the side effects. At some point the leeches decided they could cure cancer and a big plus was they are not covered by insurance so it is a cash business.

Bottom line is it is not helping, the cancer is huge and her back hurts frequently (often breast cancer becomes bone cancer). She and the leeches make excuse after excuse. I don't argue anymore, I just help where I can and keep the money coming in (this costs $500-$700 per week). Arguing about it was tearing us apart.

How do I deal with it? When we travel I play Pokémon Go because we are in different places and I am often alone and waiting. The treatment doesn't hurt and there are no side effects to speak of. I work on the road a lot because I have to.

The money is not really a problem but it is disturbing. This is a continuing story so I don't really know what the future will bring.

The nurses are engaged in palliative medicine, they're interested in making very sick people feel better. It's normal for you to want your normal mom but she's going through major medical problem that makes it impossible.

You could bring it up to a doc again and ask for her to be prescribed a difference benzo, like clonazepam (""klonopin"" is the common brand name) if you feel that the valium specifically is having a bad reaction in your mom. I feel for you because benzos *on their own* can make people act high as heck, at least until the patient develops tolerance to the drug, in combination with IV or liquid morphine it's like a drug abuser's dream come true.

Then again you just have to keep in mind, this isn't just your experience, it's your mom's also. If she wants to be high as shit for the last time she's alive, that's her right, right? Sorry you have to deal with this. The benzos and opioid combo will make her high as hell and basically solves anxiety and pain by making her not think of or care about things...like lighting up inside places, etc.

Imagine being high and having drugs make you feel like ""woohoo, fuck it!"", thats what benzos and opiates together do.

At that point, I still had a very hard time eating but was off IV nutrition, so in the hospital I would eat room temp chicken broth and rubbery scrambled eggs and suffer through a bottle or two of ensure. Food at home wasn't much better in terms of taste or even ability to consume, but my mom was relentless with getting me to eat. Nondairy milkshakes / smoothies ended up working okay for food basically from day 1.

I spent a lot of time watching TV. I couldn't really use the computer due to the neuropathy in my hands. I couldn't concentrate well enough to read a book (this took months). I was able to go for walks around the neighborhood, but my energy and neuropathy only let me walk about 15 minutes for a couple months. 

I had no problems with opioid dependence. Palliative care docs made sure we stepped down the dilaudid dose over a few days while I was still inpatient instead of stopping outright when the pain dropped. They gave me more codeine in case of pain, and I needed it for pain for a couple weeks (usually neuropathy). I never got any benefit from morphine, so it was always codeine or dilaudid from early after diagnosis. An important thing to remember is that addiction is a behavior. Taking a prescribed drug for pain doesn't make you an addict. Taking the drug for reasons that aren't pain, lying to your docs to get more, and taking too much are all not so great. I also was afraid (and still am) of painkillers. It worked out okay for me, and I think being honest with my doctors helped. (Months after transplant, I was still taking codeine about once a week for neuropathy. I saw a neurologist and mentioned that the codeine only sped up feeling better from like 1 hour of bad pain to 30 minutes and that taking it preventatively didn't work.

In hindsight I wish I had tried to talk him out of it. I think he would have lasted longer without treatment. It was just too much for his elderly body to handle. But that is such a tough situation because it's hard for everyone to accept that someone is going to die and there isn't much that can be done to change it.

RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6dzdik,1,di6rgur,"You may get some good answers here. /r/AskDocs may also have more information since you are asking for medical advice: ""Will there be any problems?"" One person's case may not answer your question but could provide useful information.

Depending on the intent of therapy (curative, palliative, life prolonging) and factors influencing the decision for intent (age, overall health, major medical problems, cancer stage), breast cancer management involves several type of cancer doctors.
For cure, breast cancer always requires surgery. Chemo may add benefit and is given either before of after surgery for various reasons. Radiation may add benefit and is always given after surgery, and usually after the first chemotherapy regimen. There is the exception of certain cases in which radiation can be given before surgery on clinical trial (pre-operative radiation in the Netherlands, US, perhaps elsewhere). There are also exceptions where a person is of advanced age and may have other illnesses that are more serious than the breast cancer. The breast cancer may not affect their lifespan or quality of life, and in this case therapy should be tailored for that patient. 

Can I ask how old your mother is, the stage of her diagnosis (if you know), and why surgery isn't firmly on the  table?

I did a literature search and see nothing related to radiotherapy and FMF. The disease does not seem related to any of the genetic changes that are associated with adverse outcomes following radiotherapy. Should she require radiation, it is probably safe. Certain drugs should not be given with radiation (methotrexate), and the radiation doctor should speak with the doctor taking care of her FMF (rhematology or whomever else).

It's very common and as a previous poster commented, the damage that the chemo can do to your system far outweighs the benefits when your white counts are low. It's hard to sit back and skip a week, but just because you're not getting your chemo doesn't mean your body's not still fighting the cancer. Definitely ask your doctor about the neupogen and/or the neulasta at your next appointment. If you are concerned that this may happen again do some of your own research on these drugs (neulasta and/or neupogen) and bring that information with you to the doctor so that you are coming from an educated point of view.  Also keep in mind, these injections are not without their own side effects.
Also to add, not just from a professional point of view but from a personal point of view, my father is also a cancer patient and had many instances where his treatment was held due to his counts. He was diagnosed nine years ago with an ""incurable"" cancer, at the time of his diagnosis they told him to start getting his affairs in order and began speaking of palliative care. He chose instead to fight, and even with the multiple instances of his held treatment he has still been off of chemo for the last year with what can only be described as a tumor of dead cells in his body.

Iatros,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6flzqv,3,dik2plk,"First, I'm really sorry to hear about your mom. That really sucks. Did she have asbestos exposure? 80% of people (more or less) with pleural meso will have had exposure, but 20% are just ""lucky."" I'm one of the ""lucky"" ones, but my mesothelioma is the abdominal kind (you can also get meso arising from the covering of the heart (pericardium) and testicles (tunica vaginalis)).

Second, are you guys at a major academic medical center? If not, you need to find one post-haste. The standard of treatment at an academic center is going to be orders of magnitude better for a rare cancer like mesothelioma. In the community (i.e., your local neighborhood hospital), they'll probably just offer palliative chemotherapy. At an academic medical center where they have experience treating mesothelioma, she'll at least be evaluated for the possibility of surgery. 

They do something called an [extrapleural pneumonectomy](http://thoracic.surgery.ucsf.edu/conditions--procedures/extrapleural-pneumonectomy.aspx) which is basically a surgical debulking procedure. You try to get all of the tumor out (or at least as much as possible), and then they infuse the cavity with hyperthermic chemotherapy to try to kill the micro-metastases that we pretty much know are there but can't see. 

People who are good candidates for the surgery can do **much** better than people who just get chemotherapy. I don't know the numbers for pleural meso off the top of my head like I do for peritoneal, but just for example, in my disease, the life expectancy without surgery is like a year to 18 months. With the surgery, and the best available treatment, some centers have gotten their 10-year survival rate up to above 70%. So it can be an *enormous* difference in outcome.

The [Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation](http://www.curemeso.org) can help you get in touch with various specialists around the world (I'm assuming you're not in the US from the use of ""mum""). By the way, they're probably the best mesothelioma group to get in touch with. A **lot** of the other mesothelioma websites are just fronts for ~~scum sucking bottom dwellers~~ plaintiff's attorneys trying to make a buck off of your misfortune.

And feel free to get a few opinions if the first person you see declines the surgery. Some surgeons are more experienced and/or aggressive than others and may do a case that someone else won't.

Beyond that, there are multiple phase I and II clinical trials using some of the new immunotherapy agents or other novel treatments (CAR T-cells for example, or attenuated listeria that creates an immune response to tumor proteins). Many of them have shown at least some success in disease control.

Since he is on palliative care, that's the most likely person to be taking care of him, and if not, it should be easy to find someone helpful who is familiar with your situation if you just reach out to the staff.",t3_6i1pfs,,2017-06-19 05:59:13,,,,

ParkieDude,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6k8ya6,7,djk8c3i,"I'm sorry to hear that.   Losing your Dad is never easy.

Twenty years later I still think of my Dad daily.  

If you are still in Houston, do reach out the Social Workers who are there. They are a fantastic team, and can help you through this. I was an idiot as I didn't want to show my emotions when my father was dying, nor admit afterwards how deeply I missed him. So do reach out to the support team.

As hard as it seems right now, please understand there are something beyond our control. In a perfect world Cancer wouldn't exist, but it does. Keep focused on the good times, even the little lessons in getting sent to your room. All Dad's love their kids, so there is never a right time to leave. Life is short.  

A friend of mine was diagnosed at the same time with the same type of cancer, and his comment was he couldn't believe how brave I was dealing with Parkinson's. He told me if he was half as brave dealing with his cancer as I was, he was doing good. 

As I've gotten older I've known friends who suddenly died. They never got a chance to tell their sons and daughters how much they loved them, or how proud they have made him. So while time is short, you have been given this incredible gift of a few months. So talk to him, even understand if the medications to control pain make him non responsive, he is still listening and wishing you the best.

Also keep your friends close. Often they say something that may not come out right, but it isn't that they meant to be mean, but just didn't know what to say.  One thing that pissed me for a long time was ""Well, your Dad was old so not surprising he died"".  What they meant was ""He had a great life and got to know his kids, but it is sad he didn't get to meet all his grandkids"". I was pissed for years over that comment, but with age I've gained some wisdom to understand the person didn't know what to say (Or really is an idiot, but the first person to show up and help when I was getting ready for a race).

So take advantage of sitting with him. It's OK to hold your Dad's hand.

For me I take comfort in the smallest things, like a sunrise and just warmth of the sun on my face.  ",t3_6k8ya6,,2017-06-29 15:57:40,,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_djks6bf,2,djl0yv7,"Yea, the lymph nodes of the neck travel down into the chest lymph nodes (contiguous) so it sounds like the lowest levels of the neck or highest of the chest are cancerous. This situation can be hard or impossible to cure.

As for the primary tumor of the face, it sounds large and hard to cure. Perhaps your father has made the right choice. 

With no treatment, probably weeks, maybe months. Less than six months without any chemo. I would discuss the case with a palliative or hospice doctor if he is off all aggressive therapy.  But it sounds like you've done this already.",t3_6kawsk,,2017-06-30 00:55:02,,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_djoq757,3,djovx33,"&gt; They rushed him in for some radiotherapy which they said stopped the growth for the time being... I think he is stage 3b, I would assume he will die from the cancer. 

Some Stage IIIB is curable, but survival rates are poor even with aggressive therapy. If your doctors were talking about therapy to slow down or help with symptoms from cancer rather than curing it, then the cancer will continue to grow, which it sounds like what you were told. Without combined chemotherapy and radiation for about 6.5-7 weeks (in most US institutions, UK accelrates treatment in some instances to 4 weeks), the disease will ultimately progress and be fatal if something else does not cause death first. Other issues exist in very ill people with lung cancer such as lung and heart disease that also is a frequent cause of death. 

&gt; The weird thing to me was they told us they didn't need to scan him again after radio because they will see him swell up when it starts growing, which could very well be normal but to me that sounded odd.

In the setting where a cancer is not curable, there are many instances where doing more imaging (aka scans) adds nothing to the patient's care. It is an extra trip, procedure, and cost, and for what benefit exactly? If your father is being treated palliatively it could make a lot of sense that doing less to him would mean more quality of life for him. In the setting of a new symptom, a scan would be done. Also, swelling and growth are different. Swelling is when something is temporarily increased in size with fluid of a sort, like when you bump or injure a joint and it increases in size. Growth of a tumor in the chest is due to a growth of a mass, not fluid swelling.

&gt;The pain he's receiving is just under his rib cage

The rib cage stretches around the entire chest. Could you perhaps include the front or back of the chest, under the breastbone, along the central back (AKA Spine), or a side (left or right) on which this is occurring? When did this pain start? How has it changed since then (worse, same, better)? What makes it better (medicine, rest, etc)? What makes it worse (certain motions, not taking medication, etc)?

&gt;  it seems you get referred to a hospice in the U.K. If you have any sort of cancer 

Any of our UK community care to comment on this? Is hospice a center for palliative care regardless of prognosis?",t3_6ktou5,,2017-07-02 17:56:59,,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_djowyfm,1,djoxagq,"You need to coordinate with your doctors on identifying a cause and a symptom management plan. If they don't have medicine that can help him, they need to say straight out that there is nothing else that can be done. It really does not sound like the options have been exhausted but I could be wrong. Sometimes a short course of palliative radiation can improve pain especially if the tumor is invading a rib nearby and that is causing his pain. Again, his pain could be unrelated to his cancer. Coughing a lot can cause a rib fracture. I doubt I will get a full picture of your father's case over the internet, and he needs a good care team to see him and tell you exactly whats up with this new chief complaint of chest pain. For now, follow your teams recommendations of increase pain meds if that was the last thing they still asked you to try until you get pain relief. Honestly, it sounds like he needs to keep going up on his long acting pain med, but this is not a recommendation, just an impression from the limited story so far.",t3_6ktou5,,2017-07-02 18:27:52,,,,
lyranen,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6kw2gl,17,djpez4q,"Hey Max. So sorry you're going through this, and at a young age too.  I have stage 4 and am on palliative care. I'm going to die. When telling friends and family I tend to just let them know that doctors are working First to keep me comfortable, next to keep me around longer, but they aren't going to fix it. And then I tend to group people into two categories. One is the ""you can beat this b.s."" and the other is a darker but more realistic ""how can I help you die"" group.  I find myself pulling away from the super positive people who think they can heal me with thoughts and prayers and hope. My closest friends are those who let me cry and boohoo and never say ""you'll be OK."" But are still here for me.

Everyone is different. And everyone's family and friends will react differently. Just don't be afraid to let people know what you need and expect. And it's OK that some friends won't be able to be there for you. That's just part of the disease.

At some point you and your loved ones should define what ""fighting"" is. In my experience, most of us stage 4 patients think of it as a mental fight more than a physical fight. For us and our loved ones to not get bogged down by a disease we have no control over. To accept that the last really good day of our lives is behind us and still move forward with as much grace and dignity we're aloud. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but I hope it's what someone will tell my children when the time comes.

Did chemo (Alimta &amp; Cisplaten) in the summer of 2013, then had lobectomy surgery, upper left, in September 2013, followed by 32 days of radiation. In June 2014 a scan found tumors on my right lung and I was re-staged to stage 4 and doctors told me I had about 6 to 8 months to live and should get my affairs in order. Then I did about 10 months of chemo with taxol until that quit working. At that point my doctors, and insurance company, recommended palliative care. One doctor decided that I had a chance and, after 3 tries, got the insurance companies to pay for 5 sessions of SBRT radiation in July 2015. I also did a LOT of complimentary and alternative therapies.
 
I have scanned tumor-free since late summer, 2015, and my life is slowly getting back to normal.

Jeskalr,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6m4pva,3,dk00hju,"Everything that people have said here abt MSK is true.  My father was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma 9 years ago and his local md told him he needed to go to a specialist, but that he'd probably be looking at palliative care.  The median life expectancy of someone with CCA is 5 yrs.  9 years out, my dad is still alive and off of chemo for the last year.  His tumor is now just a collection of dead cells (inoperable due to location)

2 years ago I got an administrative position there.  What's really amazing to me is how many people that work there who were treated there themselves and/or had family members treated there.   The people I work with treat every patient as if they are their own family. 

Yes you may wait in the MD office but it's because the doctor takes his/her time with each and every patient before you.   As I tell the patients in my clinic; the doctor will answer all your questions, won't look at his/her watch, tell you ""your time is up"".  It's great when you're the  patient in the room, but sometimes you're not and then you have to wait.  

I feel like people on yelp are only there to complain and get free stuff from companies trying to make things right.  If you go into someplace looking for problems, you will find problems each and every time. 

It's your life (or hers in this case) go to the best place.

RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6nl8o1,7,dkak9rb,"I know many people who decline treatment. This is always in the palliative setting or when there is an equally good alternative (anastrazole for low risk resected breast cancer over the age of 70). We discuss how likely treatment is to help and what benefit treatment will have. If someone is making a decision that doesn't make sense (0 side effect, 100% likelihood of helping), we discuss what their hang up is and we almost always get around it or find another solution.

Those who are not planning on definitive treatment don't bother to come into the office unless they are mentally ill with a psychiatric/emotional (e.g. mood disorder) problem, and then that is another challenge. 

We of course have people who try alternative treatments until they fail, and then our job is to figure out what's their current situation in terms of stage and cure vs palliation, and how to best take care of them.",t3_6nl8o1,,2017-07-16 15:14:52,,,,

But the truth is that right now, you really don't know. So don't fixate (if that's a word?) on the possibility of it having spread too much. Because you might be ok.

Also if not: even only getting palliative treatment might not be an immediate death sentence. I have been diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in 2013. I still got curative treatment initially. It didn't work, so my treatment has been officially palliative and my cancer declared incurable since 2014. I'm still here. The last few weeks haven't been great and I fear that I won't be here much longer if there is no miracle. But still: those years I got so far... years that weren't a walk in the park... they're precious. 

But your prognosis might be better than mine. Again: so far, you don't know. And it sucks to have to wait for something like this. I get it. 

Try to do some normal activities. Distraction helps. Hug your kid, watch your favorite sitcom, go out for drinks or dinner with a friend, do a BBQ, go swimming, play board games, whatever you like etc. I found things like this important. Make yourself feel normal... cancer is not what defines you.

TheHappyFox,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6nl8o1,3,dke0m7i,"As others have said, sadly there is no right or wrong answer for any one person. I'll give my two cents, based on watching both parents succumb to cancer young (in their 50s/60s, in the last 3 years) and hearing many, many stories. I think the decision to opt for treatment depends on three major  factors: 

1. how advanced is the cancer, 

2. treatment efficacy and side effects

3. is the patient in good enough mental/physical health to withstand the side effects. 

My dad was initially very set against conventional treatment for his cancer (colon, adenocarcinoma). He tried a bunch of nonconventional diet/supplement treatments for a while following initial resection surgery and a round of oral chemo, and his quality of life was pretty good for about 2 years, but the cancer came back as Stage IV (lungs, brain, bone). He was on and off oral chemo for about a year after that, and it seemed to slow the growth, but still the cancer would spread--plus, his quality of life was truly ZERO on the chemo. Once, it nearly killed him by leaving him susceptible to a staph infection that enveloped his lungs (it was total chance that he was saved, he happened to be at the hospital for a different reason when his fever suddenly spiked insanely). When he finally went off the chemo for good, there were a few months where he felt good, and then the end came like a freight train. 

Over his four years battling cancer, what seemed to matter to him the most was that he was doing treatment HIS way, as much as he could. Did I sometimes privately freak out that he was spending a bunch of money on some crazy new supplements or an expensive ""frequency generation"" contraption? Sure. Are there a million ""what ifs?"" that roll around in my head when I think about whether a different path could have helped him live for longer with a better quality of life? You bet. But at the end of the day, the decisions were his, and I did my best to support his wishes.

Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions based on your specific situation. My mom's cancer was too far advanced for anything but palliative care, and you can bet I learned all about the millions of alternative ""treatments"" out there.  ",t3_6nl8o1,,2017-07-18 17:39:58,,,,
ecaward,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6p58be,2,dkpiwv8,"Take as many pictures as you can and record all the video you can. You said he starts chemo next week? Do it this weekend. Get as many pictures away from hospitals and cancer treatment centers as possible in the next week. My mom asked me 3 months into her treatment if we could have professional pictures done before she lost her hair, and I didn't have the money at the time so I asked her if we could schedule for the following week because she was doing well - lots of energy and happy - and doctors had no concerns she would be on a cruise by July. Like some cruel joke, and 3 months on now, I will never get those pictures. I would give up years off my own life to have those memories now. I'll regret it for the rest of my life. 

Also, know it's okay to take a break. Caregiver burnout is real and you will inevitably face your own mortality 100x a day as a caregiver. It's okay to take a step back and enjoy the time you have left too. You'll have a team of people to care for your dad. You need to utilize them and not feel guilty for recognizing that death comes for all of us, and we need to live our lives too. I ran my self into the ground sleeping on hospital couches, giving up traveling, exercising and sacrificing time with my other family. In a moment of lucidity, my mom told me how much it hurt her to see me so tired and unhappy. Your dad wants your support, but he also wants you to be happy and healthy. Force yourself to find some balance - for both of you. 

A good hospital will have a palliative care doctor who will do more than just dole out pain medicine. I've cried to my mom's palliative care doctor many times. We've had some tough but healing family counseling sessions in my mom's hospital rooms so my mom could be a part of them. He referred me to a counselor and helped me set up the appointment when I just got too tired to care. It has been and will be the kindest thing anyone has ever given me.

JamaicanGinger,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6tepdx,1,dllx5mr,"I'm not at all familiar with how things are run in Amsterdam but I'm sure there must be some sort of clinical trial system in place. In the US, when people run out of standard of care options, clinical trials are an option that allows them to try a new therapy that isn't available to the public. All of our chemotherapies and medications go through the clinical trial system so it's not as if they are getting inferior therapy, by the time they are in clinical trials, these medications have already been proven to have a high potential to help. [This](https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/location/international/Netherlands/Amsterdam) may be a place to search but I'm sure there are others. 

Not sure if your medical system uses palliative care but in the US, palliative care is a speciality that helps with symptom management. Anyone with a chronic disease such as cancer, can go to a palliative care doctor to get medications to relieve pain, help with fatigue, or other symptoms. The goal isn't to cure, but to make things comfortable and manageable. You can search for a palliative care doctor or ask her doctors to recommend one.

**&gt; I could be mistaken about the intended dose of radiation.**

I don't think you are. Carcinoma needs much more dose than lymphoma. I was mistaken in thinking it was lymphoma initially.

**&gt; It's my understanding that offering a patient with metastatic disease external beam radiation to kill off the mets is unorthodox.**

It's not always unorthodox. More below.

**&gt; The right hilar, left hilar and subcarinal nodes are all involved, along with enough disease in the airway to cause a small stridor.** 

Which airways, if I might ask? You could see this usually on CT if it's causing symptoms. Bronchoscopy is good for visualizing it as well.

**&gt; The possible side effects that are most concerning to me are esophagitis and pneumonitis. My Rad Onc also mentioned the possibility of an allergic reaction to radiation, which might result in fibrosis.
If I encounter these side effects and find them unacceptable, are they reversible once treatment ends?**

Short term or acute side effects happen during or within a week of completing treatment. These are things like skin reaction, esophagitis, cough, chest wall (rib/muscle) pain, and fatigue. Aside from fatigue, they are almost directly related to the dose, but not everyone gets the same reaction at the same dose. The amount of an organ that gets radiation will also be related to the side effect. The dose and organ amount are used together to figure out how likely a side effect is to happen. Acute side effects resolve usually following radiation.

Sub-acute and late effects occur weeks to months after radiation, respectively. Pneumonitis is sub-acute, usually. It is reversible, but sometimes can turn into scar tissue and result in permanent decrease in breathing function. Severe pneumonitis like that is usually rare, but that is because patients are selected for getting radiation. The lung dose and volume is limited by this and by planning so that the radiation goes elsewhere. Bilateral hilar involvement usually results in a lot of lung getting radiation because there is literally no where else to put the radiation as it passes through the body to get to those central structures. This is part of why some radiation oncologists would be cautious in offering a high dose or any treatment at all. The allergic reaction, if he is talking about hypersensitivity pneumonitis or organizing pneumonia (sometimes called BOOP), are at least two entities that are poorly understood and uncommonly seen. The latter doesn't result in fibrosis usually. The former, I'm not sure I've ever seen or heard of since we rarely discuss it, but it seems to continue into progressive fibrosis. There is very little published on it, and if your oncologist is an older gentleman, than maybe he is remembering some research from the old days. Perhaps he is just explaining radiation pneumonitis.

When there is subcarinal and left hilar involvement, the esophagus is within the volume that needs a high dose, so avoiding a high dose to the esophagus is probably unlikely or impossible. The longer up and down the disease is, the more volume of esophagus will get radiation, making the sore throat and swallowing trouble that much tougher. Patients with lung cancer often get 60 Gy to this area and are fine, without long standing side effects. Late effects of irradiating the esophagus are possibly strictures requiring dilation by endoscopy, which works pretty well. Perforation can occur but this is unusual, meaning a radiation oncologist almost never sees it unless there is something increasing the risk for this like cancer from outside involving the esophagus.

In summary, for a carcinoma which needs a high dose for a long term response or maybe any response, in a bilateral hilar and subcarinal location, with the predisposition for bad side effects at higher doses, it is challenging to deliver dose. For a person who is predicted to live a long time, more dose may be more likely to result in longer local control based upon the histology of the disease and it's underlying biologic behavior. It's true for many carcinoma, and the amount of radiation needed varies across types. If disease is a very responsive to radiation, long term control in the irradiated area could be possible. If it's a hardier type, then that's less likely. A simple 30 gy/10 is a standard palliative carcinoma dose and will make someone feel better probably if they have anything but the tougher kinds of carcinoma. Using a shorter course of radiation, like SBRT/SABR, is another investigative approach to metastases, but to the central airways and vessels can result in severe or fatal side effects and is almost always avoided. There are a lot of technical and biologic considerations to take into consideration. In weighing the potential or guaranteed side effects, their severity and likelihood based on all that is above, and the benefits of improvement in symptoms and duration of that benefit, as well as potential future interventions (re-irradiation if lower doses initially are given), an oncologist can come up with a treatment recommendation.

RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_6wnjco,2,dm9wo7z,"&gt;I don't know if there's such a thing as local metastasis where they could take the arm and one of the lungs

No. Metastatic lung cancer should have a PET/CT to understand where his disease is, CT Chest or also CT abdomen and pelvis if PET cannot be done, and MRI brain w contrast. MRI Spine/hip or Bone scan are sometimes indicated if other tests are not helpful or can't be performed.

&gt; if the fact that it's reached the bone essentially means it's systemic now.

Yes.

&gt; But the doctors say it's incurable by normal radiation/chemotherapy, he would just be sacrificing quality of life to buy time.

Did you talk to a medical oncologist and radiation oncologist? Local radiation to the clavicle is easy and relatively minor in terms of symptoms (some skin irritation that feels like a bad sunburn, mild fatigue). There are other palliative therapies that exist that are not experimental, depending on his age, fitness, and underlying lung/heart disease from smoking that lung cancer patients are candidates for.

MyOwnGuitarHero,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_dn2srfj,2,dn2z9ly,"But remember, those are also symptoms associated with cancer, and pain, generally. They don't necessarily mean a patient is actively dying *right now*. That's why it can be really difficult sometimes to determine a prognosis. In fact, some specialists won't even give a prognosis because if you give too little time and the patient survives longer, people think the doctor is an idiot; if you give too much time and the patient passes earlier than expected, the family feels cheated. 

Palliative care is for folks who have a chronic illness but can still receive threatment for their conditions. The goal of hospice care, on the other hand, is to provide a dignified death to patients with less than six months to live. 

Palliative care comes into the home and will help manage pain, assist the patient with activities of daily living, and engage the family in creating a support system for the patient. 

Hospice care is delivered either in-home or inpatient, and focuses on preventing suffering at the end of life. We also provide social workers or case managers to help families with end-of-life issues such as funeral arrangements or meal delivery services. 

Both are excellent options that I highly encourage you to explore with his care team at some point so you can get a better understanding of what each type of service can provide to you and your family. ",t3_6zyndo,,2017-09-16 13:07:21,,,,

I would suggest getting a palliative care team to take care of your grandmother as soon as possible if she is not anymore undergoing treatment. They will make sure that your grandmother is as comfortable as possible (e.g. injecting morphine or other pain killers, giving her an oxygen mask to make her breathing easier) 

Every case is different, and no doctor can possibly predict how much time any cancer patient has left. My grandmother just passed last July from Endometrial Cancer. She was told to have 6 months left but only stayed with us for weeks. She gave us signs though like low pulse-oximeter values and the way she was breathing was not anymore normal. She already started using an oxygen mask 2 weeks before she passed. During this time, she also had doses of morphine. We just wanted to make sure she was in the least amount of pain possible. We stayed with her and talked to her and tried our best to comfort her. She passed in her room at home. Honestly, we knew she didn't have that much time left, and we refused to puncture her throat or do any more things that would lengthen her pain. There were basic end-of-life cancer signs that she was manifesting. 

The best you can do for now is to make sure your grandmother is in the least amount of pain possible. Keep her company as much as you possibly can, hold her hand, and talk to her. Tell her how much you love her and that you're there for her. Cancer is so unpredictable.

Spending time and money on a treatment because it just might help when the evidence is pretty flimsy and the rates of improvement aren't so great may not justify spending these two commodities. 

That said, it could be worth a shot, but most practitioners such as oncologists who also have strong palliative care backgrounds are not running IV vitamin C infusions in their clinic, and they are all for making patients tolerate chemo better, because guess what? Then they can give more chemo, potentially giving more life prolonging therapy. It's a win-win; patients do better, and oncologists can bill for two infusions while giving more chemo. And yet very few are writing vitamin c infusions. You can trust that if the oncologist had a trick/treatment to make a patient feel better, they would absolutely use it.

Labrat33,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_755g35,6,do5fw6b,"A few thoughts. You were not treated with adjuvant intent and you did not have pseudo Stage III disease. Despite the absence of measurable disease on CT, you had incurable peritoneal disease at completion of surgery and the intent of chemotherapy was always palliative. Progression was inevitable. This is an important distinction because recurrence within 12-months of adjuvant FOLFOX is suggestive of inactivity of Oxaliplatin and would suggest that there would be no benefit from re-exposure. In contrast, a patient with peritoneal disease that is radiologically occult who has ANY period of disease control prior to progression once FOLFOX has been stopped should be considered as having disease potentially sensitive to FOLFOX, and re-exposure is highly appropriate. Your disease was diagnosed in 2015 and even if it were diagnosed in 12/2015 you would have finished FOLFOX probably by 8/2016 at the latest. If you are only progressing now, I would say that the FOLFOX was extraordinarily effective in controlling your disease and would have no hesitation to re-expose and provide a prognosis far superior to anything you have suggested.


Because your tumor has not progressed on FOLFOX, then use of prognostic data from studies looking at survival after progression on first-line treatment would be inappropriate.


Second, the inability to observe disease on CT with peritoneal-only disease is very common. I frequently employ a less-intensive maintenance chemotherapy strategy rather than complete interruption after 6-months of FOLFOX as I know that I cannot rely upon the scans to accurately report disease burden.


Third, has your tumor been tested for mutations in KRAS,NRAS, and BRAF? Had MSI testing been performed? Outcomes of this testing has further, and sometimes dramatic, implications for treatment options and prognosis. 


Do you have residual neuropathy from your prior FOLFOX?  In absence of neuropathy, it would seem that FOLFOX with Avastin would be a very reasonable choice. In presence of neuropathy, FOLFIRI/Avastin now, and at progression, hopefully with further improvement in neuropathy, switch to FOLFOX/Avastin (if Ras or BRAF mutated) or FOLFOX/Panitumumab (if Ras and BRAF wildtype). 

If your tumor is in the small minority that is MSI instable, then not attempting Keytruda (pembrolizumab) or Opdivo (nivolumab) at some point would be ludicrous.

It is true that compared to other sites of metastatic disease, that peritoneal spread has a poorer prognosis. However, there are multiple studies of modern chemotherapy that have shown reasonable benefit - with medians far superior to what you have reported, and minorities with exceptional responses and survival far superior to what you have suggested. The largest studies (CALGB 80405 and FIRE-3) did not report survival based upon site of metastatic disease, which would have been nice, but do include a large minority of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis in their study populations.

Our friend has had two reasonably good years of being quite able, but now in year three is really too emaciated (horrible word, but it's the best description) and weak to venture far from home.

Unfortunately for him, his initial presentation is about worst case scenario.  PSA in the 200's pretty much guaranteed a high grade pathology and metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Totally agree with hormone therapy with firmagon and he's about what I tell my patients in terms of how durable the response will be.  Patients who present with disease like your dad ha e on average 2 years until they're castrate resistant.  Casodex (bicalutamide) is a good choice to add but unlikely to have much response if at all.  There is another androgen receptor blocker on the market that in similar to zytiga, but different enough that it could give him some extra time without awful side effects.  It's called Xtandi (enzalutimide).  As a community between urologists and oncologists we are trying to figure out the progression of these drugs as the landmark studies about both zytiga and xtandi we're looking at patients AFTER chemo. So, to date, there isn't data about used prior to chemo. Most oncologists, however, will use them before because the chemo is fairly toxic.  There's also an immunotherapy that could give him a few months As well called provenge (sipulicel-T) but based on his health, he may not be a candidate for that.  I hope this helps.  All these treatments will give him some extra time here, but curing him is not possible.  The radiation treatments would only be a palliative measure as well. The hope would be to relieve the urinary obstruction by shrinking the tumor locally and try to decrease pain.  I am terribly sorry for you and your dad.

Not been in a similar situation (grandparents died, most from cancer, before I was born) but I've thought about it a lot during my own treatment. How I would think and act when/if it comes back. 

I'm all in for palliative care and depending on the disease and my age I would probably look into it. I know it's hard to say and decide now, time could change it a lot. But I'm definitely one of those persons who value life quality over life quantity.

I have Stage 4 colon cancer, no cures out there and I'm on life-extending chemo.  So far my cancer is kept nicely at bay, eventually it will start to grow until it kills me, if I don't die of something else first, like the blood clot I got from chemo a few months ago.

I'm happier than I've ever been in my life.  I have been gazing at my death for over half a year now, and it's changed everything.  I have the choice to choose my attitude and how I face each day.  I spent two months freaking out and then things started to shift the other way.

I have fantastic support from my family, friends, and medical team.  My meditation practice helped reduce my freak-outs initially, now I have a focused study of what's important in life and how to face death.  I've talked to my palliative care director and I know generally how I'm going to die.  I have friends who work in hospice that will be with me.  I get knocked down from chemo every other week, but it's helping me to live much longer than I would without it.  I'm much more emotionally open, from occasionally bursting into tears to having more and more amazing connections with people who understand what's truly important in life, and living in wonder about how beautiful everything is around me.

The possibility of cancer and other maladies is one of the conditions of living in a human body.  There is no escape from death, it comes from us all.  Instead of dealing with it when I was 70-80-90 like I expected, I'm dealing with it now.

Most unnecessary things (and people) have dropped away.  I still freak out from time to time, but my default state is to be happy and grateful most of the time.  What matters is what's happening right now.",t3_7988ex,,2017-11-03 23:57:46,/r/cancer/comments/7988ex/my_own_mortality/dpbc0oa/,,,
RadiationMD,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_7am06b,6,dpbjzai,"I'm sorry to hear of your situation, OP. Caveat: I have no knowledge of this situation and this is a painting in broad strokes that may not apply to this particular situation. This sounds like it depends on the primary site, where the recurrence is, and where the radiation was given . 

**Primary site:** ""upper neck"" isn't a ""site"" of disease. Site describes where the cancer originates. We talk about tonsils, larynx, tongue, usually. He had a tonsil primary tumor and neck nodes with cancer in them I would gather. Is that right? Was this smoking and alcohol related, HPV-related, both, or neither?

**Recurrence:** The esophagus is a long tube starting just under the larynx and extending all the way through the chest to the upper abdomen. It is not a common site of failure for head and neck cancers. Do you know where on [this picture](https://imgur.com/8uHnpNC) it recurred? If this is a weird recurrence far down the esopaghus, that more likely predicts other distant failure as well. Distant failure just means not in the area of the original tumor or it's draining lymph nodes. However, this also means it has most likely traveled to settle there via the bloodstream, and that this will soon happen elsewhere. 

**Radiation technique**: Where the radiation was given can be quite targeted nowadays and can even miss areas of potential recurrence if not designed well. I believe that the majority of patients are treated appropriately and this scenario is uncommon and unlikely to represent yours but again, I have no knowledge of your specific situation. If this was a ""marginal failure"" starting just under or outside the radiation volume due to the aggressiveness of the disease, too small treatment volumes, or both, salvage options may exist like surgery and sometimes repeat radiation with chemo or biotherapy (Cetuximab), but head and neck salvage can range quite low in terms of successful cure. You can seek a second opinion or search for a trial if you were considering repeat radiation for a near miss of radiation or small in field recurrence, but I have seen these rarely salvaged in some local failure cases, not in the distant failures. You would need to get all his records and even get his ""radiation plan"" sent to a consulting radiation oncologist, and I would search specifically for a large academic center with a well known radiation oncologist specializing in head and neck. This all depends very much on where in the esophagus this is. 


**Treatment of distant failures** is ""palliative."" Once again, I'm not certain this is your situation or that this applies to you. These treatments are intended to extend quality of life and possibly quantity of life. They are not experimental but are established and standard of care for these patients, but they are not curative. As you said, ""There are only experimental options"". There are no experimentally curative treatments in this sort of situation. There are possible clinical trials, which are like experiments but better termed investigations as they are designed to try to advance our medical understanding and sometimes will translate into improvements for other patients. 

No aggressive treatment is also an option sometimes recommended if people are in very bad shape or who find that the margin of benefit of semi-aggressive therapy is be low. If the person is healthy, sometimes they live for many months, but more than 1-2 years seems uncommon in these kinds of cancers. Ones that pop up only a few months after treatment usually progressive quickly but can still respond to systemic therapies initially. Systemic therapies are often chemotherapy or immunotherapies like pembrolizumab. I'm very sorry to hear of this news and hope you can maintain your love and find peace and hope in you and your father's lives despite this situation.",t3_7am06b,,2017-11-04 02:53:52,/r/cancer/comments/7am06b/totally_blindsided_distant_cancer_recurrence_in/dpbjzai/,,,

Everything else is oral or opioid (transdermal fentanyl, technically, is not topical but is on the skin). Dexamethasone and radiation are often very helpful for bony pain from cancer. Neuropathic pain is well treated with tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentin and similar medications. Scapula radiation is often well tolerated and fatigue and skin darkening or redness are the most common short term temporary effects and unlikely to cause other severe issues in areas not previously irradiated.

Depending on the dose and location, reirradiation palliatively or definitively (fot cure) may be possible with or without chemotherapy. After a first failure, it may be a good idea to consult with a major university /academic cancer center with a multidisciplinary radiation and medical oncology team. Solitary plasmacytomas are very uncommon, and expertise is limited. Some centers with high volume also are more experienced with re-irradiation, and the brain, skull, and spine are locations more amendable to retreatment sometimes. I can't speak for your case in particular. All more reason to make the trip out to a big place to see what can be offered or what trials may be around.

dmoted,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_7crrzr,2,dptunf9,"Hi, I'm most likely terminal in a few years.  Chemo is keeping my cancer at bay, eventually it will stop being effective.

The biggest things that have helped me have been a meditation practice, and some excellent examples from people in my life with how they faced their own death with dignity and grace.  (Besides fantastic family/community/medical support)

When I was first diagnosed at Stage 4 (after scanning clear after chemo the year before) I spent 2 months freaking out about all I was going to 'lose'.  I was new to meditation at the time, and I found that meditating (especially with a group) really helped relax me for at the least the time I spent in meditation, but it would also sometimes last for a while after.

Eventually the shell-shock wore off and something shifted.  I went from fretting about what I was going to 'lose' to focusing on how blessed I feel, which has been a positive feedback loop to the point where I might actually be annoyingly cheerful to some people.  : ) 

I'm probably happier than I've been in my entire life.  I still freak out from time to time about my impending decline and death and all it means, but it's dialed way down.   My default state is more to be noticing what's amazing and beautiful around me right here and right now.  I only have a few more years to experience life, and I choose to focus on the positive.

I also don't do things I don't want to (with realistic expectations as a father/spouse/worker), and if people can't handle my situation and turn away, I let them go - which means that I spend my time with people that I have fuller connections with.

I had a meeting with my clinic's palliative care director and had them describe in detail how I will decline and die, and it was a better picture than I had imagined.  Now that I understand it, I can relax about it more because I understand it and know what to expect.  I've done everything I can to make sure my family will be taken care of after my death.  

The last part of my perspective is that cancer has made it very clear how tenuous life is, and how close we are to death at all times.  We could die any number of ways any day (I've had several experiences during my life where it could have happened, from idiots on the freeway to stupid fun stuff I did when I was younger to surgery).  In that way it feels more like I've adjusted to reality than received a death sentence.

If there is one thing I can recommend more than anything else right now, it's that you talk to people about what you're going through. It helped more than anything else.

Hardest one on my Sister, who was a Hospice RN, was dealing with our Dad having lung cancer.  

Fast forward 20 years, I'm the one with Lung Cancer. Nope, never smoked (odd how often I get that question). nsclc-adenocarcinoma. Chemo doesn't really touch this stuff. New mets, so it is the game of radiation, more surgery (pneumonectomy?), just wondering what is next.  To me it is just living with cancer.

She got on it in March of 2015 when it was still a study drug and continued on it when it was approved by they FDA in early 2016. She is terminal stage 4 with brain mets and has had whole brain and spinal radiation and some targeted therapy for additional brain lesions that started growing after WBRT.

Her oncologist has never mentioned remission but described it to us as being inhibited from growing and it being palliative care due to her late staging. Eventually the cancer will mutate and not respond anymore to Alectinib as it has with other drugs my wife has been on. 
She has had very few symptoms compared to other drugs like Crizotinib and Heat90 which she was on and both had pretty severe side effects. 

The main thing about Alectinib is that it does help inhibit cancer in most if not all of the body. It is supposed to have a better chance of passing through the blood/brain barrier than other drugs. With that being said, the cancer has continued to be in her body over the past three years but Alectinib has prevented (inhibited) it from growing. This was true with my wife for most of the time she has been on it. On the past two MRIs (August and Dec) we have seen it start to grow in her brain again.

Palliative care focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness. Within an integrated model of medical care, palliative care can and should be provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging care. 

Hospice is a model of palliative care that is offered to patients at the end of life when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer indicated.

Ohm_My_God,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_7muhv2,11,drww2r9,"So there's lots of details missing but terminal and palliative care don't necessarily mean death is imminent.  When a cancer is incurable (by current methods) you are, by definition, in palliative care.  They're treating the symptoms and reducing the cause (chemo, radiation, etc) but that doesn't always mean the end is coming immediately. Obviously there may be more information you don't have yet, I hope there's still options available to your dad.

""How are you doing"" is a tricky question.  I don't want to answer ""Great"" for myself (I'm terminal and in palliative treatment myself) and I think I've decided ""Much better than expected"" is the best answer.  Physically and mentally I'm better off than I ever expected.

So the first things to do is (assuming you're in the US) is start with [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org) and look for local resources, find a local cancer support group and have your dad look at those options.  Having people to talk to in a similar situation will help, I'd go crazy without my support groups (one for metastatic and one for pancreatic).  Look into clinical trials, there's options out there for some crazy treatment ideas (I'm hoping to get into an immunotherapy trial) that even if they don't work they'll learn a lot to help people in the future.  In my book that would still be a win.

I'm sorry to hear the news about your dad, I hope everything turns out the best possible.  Again, speaking for myself, I try to concentrate on what I can control and just ignore the rest.  I concentrate on what I have to do that day and what I have to get ready for tomorrow but long range planning is mostly up in the air.  Will I be around for 2019?  Dunno.  Not worried about it, I have a lot of shit I want to get done before then.  I want to get to the West Coast to visit friends, I want to do one more trip to EU to visit friends there, as well.  I just try to keep myself as healthy as possible and work to save the money so I can do those trips (I'll be crashing at friends for both those trips, no hotel costs, so the airfare is the largest expense).  If I can get a few more bucket list things scratched off as well, then that's a bonus (just got home from New Orleans 2 weeks ago, and planning to go to New York soon).

dewnibhus,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_7qz8vi,1,dst7z3y,"My dad is in end stage, small cell lung cancer right now.

From googling, I learned that there are 3 basic types, small cell, non-small cell, and I can't remember the other type off of the top of my head.

From my 1 talk with the oncologist, I learned that smokers tend to get the small cell.  That non-smokers tend to get the non-small cell, which has a much better long term prognosis.

The small cell reproduces very rapidly, and can be put into remission for a brief window of time, but that it will come back.  Had my dad not had such a high creatinine level, they could have started him on chemo (which is very effective for a short period of time...  &lt; 1 year), but start him on the immunotherapy at the same time.  That the immunotherapy takes longer to start working, but that there was a chance that it could buy him a little more time.  But when he was originally diagnosed (11/29/17), nothing was done for him.  In fact, it wasn't until I had him hospitalized for severe dehydration (01/09) that anyone even spoke to him about treatment, and by then, he was too sick and too weak for them to be able to do anything.  About a week ago, one of the palliative care nurses informed me that if he could regain a little rigor, and get a bit stronger, that perhaps they could do a radiation treatment.  But he knew he didn't have long, and just wanted to go home.  So night before last we brought him home.  Last night (about 24 hours after he got home), he hit a state of dementia.  Right now I have a question in here about if this is going to be a permanent thing, or if it is going to come and go.  But by the time he was diagnosed, right after thanksgiving, it was in his lungs, liver, and lymphatic system.  On 01/03, they did a fine needle aspiration of a swollen lymph node, and that is when they discovered it was small cell.

So if she is a smoker, then there is a fair chance that it is small cell, and if it is small cell, don't waste a moment.  It is a rapidly reproducing, and very aggressive cancer.

Both were diagnosed at stage 4 so very serious disease right from day one. Your mum may not be stage four, so what follows may not apply to her. Both of these people had a year or so of pretty much normal life - I say 'normal' though getting chemo and what not is certainly not normal, but they lived in their own home and were able to participate in daily life quite easily. Over the next year/s though, both became very frail and thin, still living in own homes but needing help with everyday things and fatiguing easily. One then suffered an unexpected surgery complication from a very early surgery (the complication came about 1 year after the surgery), had to stop chemo, was hospitalised and died about two months later. The other is still at the stage of living at home, but very frail and not really able to participate in many things as too tired/weak. If for some reason her caregiver (partner) was not home, I don't think she'd be able to live alone any more. In her case, the chemo is also taking its toll, she now has skin issues and teeth issues.  Remember, these people were stage 4 (late stage cancer) right from diagnosis. Their chemo was for a short time seen as curative, but very quickly then seen as palliative (as in, not going cure, but hopefully stop progression). If your mum has earlier stage disease she has a much better chance of curative treatment which may not be pleasant but will be life saving. However, if worse comes to worse, one thing I will say about stage 4 colon cancer is this: it's a cruel disease but in my experience it does give people some time to do important things if they want to/have to. As for a good caregiver, from what I've observed just being an overall support person that's present and able to assist when and where needed is really a blessing.

A hospice nurse was on call for my mother and delivered her oxygen tank and analgesics as necessary, checking in with her whenever she needed. I was satisfied with the level of care we received.

She should definitely get her affairs in order ASAP. Might also want to look into euthanasia if it's legal in your state in case palliative care isn't able to handle her pain well enough.

You can look into trials that are recruiting through clinicaltrials.gov. Good oncologists are happy to call and talk to close family members with questions not answered by your fiancee's sister or to just give a quick run down. Attend her oncologist visits and meet the oncologist and team as well if you are in a life situation that permits you to be close enough and have time enough to do so. 

Why do you think your fiancee is not taking this seriously enough?

Regarding familial history of cancer and genetic/familial risk, the primary care physician should be able to set up a referral to a genetic counselor for high risk screening, if there really is risk. Not all cancers are familial, but two siblings at a young age with cancer raises eyebrows. It's important to know what kind of cancer your fiancee  had in her eye. She should find her records if she does not know, and keep a copy of this. Most commonly it is retinoblastoma for children under the age of 3-4 years; however, there are many kinds of eye cancers that can occur, including benign tumors that threaten vision like hemangiomas. You can read a lot about retinoblastoma [here.](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/retinoblastoma.html) Jumping through insurance hoops is beyond annoying, but it is important to get the proper care and know what you're starting out with (what was her eye cancer diagnosis) and where to go with it depending on if she even needs eye checks.",t3_7rvpal,,2018-01-21 21:04:26,/r/cancer/comments/7rvpal/fiances_sister_positively_diagnosed/dt0yzth/,,,

I disagree with the other posters telling you to find another doctor; if your use is consistent with what you're telling your doctor, and your tox screen reflects that, you have nothing to worry about. It is entirely the doctor having to cover their ass. We literally just had to implement urine tox screens this week for all patients receiving long term narcotics. I hate it, and I know our patients will hate it too. It's not fair to anyone, but that's the society we live in now.

ECU_BSN,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_7w4hvr,20,dtxs21a,"Firstly- make sure that your symptoms are managed to the best of abilities 100% of the time. Look into home hospice or Palliative care. This is so so important! Nagging symptoms burn a TON of energy and calories!!! A ton. More on this below....

Next- make a list and check it twice. Start making a list of goals that range from “things that require a lot of energy” to “things I can do from my bed or sofa”. Tackle the ones that require energy as soon as humanly possible. The home care team you selected will have a social worker that might be able to help or find resources. I am mora a hospice advocate because that is what I do for a living AND it covers WAY more items (Meds, DME, supplies) staffing and support. 

Most important- if you haven’t already get all your legal stuff done, signed, sealed, and stored. Out of hospital DNR, medical power of attorney, living will, POLST orders, and will. Do this ASAP as you will have days that you might not be in shape to sign these things or make clear decisions. 

Start thinking of your energy (your body “fuel”) as points. You get, for example, 10 points a day. You use 4 points eating drinking pooping peeing and doing self care. That leaves 6 points.....use them wisely. Don’t waste a single point doing anything that causes you any anxiety or grief. Remember nagging symptoms? (Nausea, pain higher than 4/10) these symptoms burn up another 4 points if untreated. Treat all the symptoms early! Don’t hold out on Meds if you need them. 

Biofeedback is HUGE. Eat foods that You crave often. Small amounts of frequent intake every 2-3 hours while awake. Higher in fat and carbs (immediate fuel) with some protein that’s easy to digest (later fuel). Example Egg and rice- we call that the “now and later” or Apple and cheese etc...
 
Sleep: people sleep a TON at end of life. Plan for this and use the awake time tackling the list. 

Infections are your literal mortal enemy nobly shake hands/touch/hug people you know and love &amp; love you. Take your temp often and report ANYTHING unusual to the hospice Nurse right away. Early infection identification and treatment is paramount. Something like the flu could be catastrophic. I don’t say this to cause fear BUT it needs your focus.

It's a bit unclear still what the etiology of her difficulty eating and weight loss is. It seems to be multifactorial, meaning more than one thing is causing it. You've described post-operative nausea, pre- and post-operative pain related to her tumors+operation+residual tumors maybe, chemotherapy-related taste loss, possible chemotherapy related nausea, early satiety, lack of desire to eat. Residual cancer can cause weight loss as well, although often chemo can do a lot to kill this off.

As you can see, there are no quick fixes here.  There are 3-4 disciplines who should be optimizing her medications and eating habits: her **medical oncologist** giving the chemo, a **dietitian/nutritionist** who can weigh in on high calorie foods and nutritional supplements and calculate daily caloric requirements, a **palliative care doctor** (possibly) to focus on her symptoms relief and can suggest things that other doctors may not have thought of, and possibly **the surgeon** who did her operation though they tend to be less involved. Due to her lack of energy, a **physical therapist** can give her simple exercises that she can tolerate well and increase her activity, though this can be difficult during chemo. There is no one right way to manage weight loss, and trying 1-2 things at a time and going from there is the right first steps usually. 

**Options that have been suggested** include antacids or acid reducers, CBD/marijuana, other antiemetics, megace (megesterol), steroids (decadron/dexamethasone), eating habits (smaller but multiple meals and inclusion of calorie dense meals), diary/journal, and increasing physical exercise as tolerated.  I don't put a lot of stock in megace and steroids due to limited efficacy or side effects. She's probably getting steroids with platinum chemo anyway.  Shes probably getting IV antiemetics with chemo too (Aloxi, Emend, etc). Marijuana/derivatives often work well to improve appetite, pain, and nausea. This seems worthwhile to consider.

Talk to her medical oncologist to get the ball rolling with referral to nutritionist and if they think PT referral is a good idea. For yourself, see if you've charted weight thus far.

Given without treatment it is aimed at increasing his quality of life typically leading to end of life care though not always.

I'll be a little more frank: no, people tend not to 'survive' hospice, but then life is 100% fatal at some point. But that's probably the wrong question to ask, albeit that I understand fully why you're asking it. Hospice is not a place where the terminally ill are sent to languish and die in order to vacate hospital beds, it's so that they can squeeze every drop of comfort and enjoyment possible out of whatever time they have left. Not much more may be done to treat the illness, but lots can be done to treat the person and alleviate symptoms. It's a different focus of care.

If you are in a position to do so, now may be a good time to think about contacting your dean of students or course leader or whoever and asking for a couple of days off, to zip back home, see your dad, and make sure your mum's keeping her head above water. I am absolutely not insinuating anything about life expectancy here, but rather know from personal experience that this can be an extremely traumatic and difficult time for all involved, as reality comes to bite; and while I was still working, I never hesitated to give someone in similar circumstances time off so they and their family could get their ducks in a row.

You can post there for different and perhaps more relevant perspectives. In my view, from what I observe, London is not the place to be with melanoma. It seems the Americans can access far better services and it goes without saying Australians as we have sky high melanoma rates. Don't give up hope and don't be scared to contact palliative care to see what htey offer. But any stage 4 cancer is serious and often fatal, melanoma being one of the rare exceptions thanks to the new immunotherapy drugs, but if he can't tolerate them then you may have to start to expect the worst.",t3_84lhzt,,2018-03-16 03:52:25,/r/cancer/comments/84lhzt/doctor_suggested_hospice_treatment_for_my_22m_dad/dvs2hkl/,,,

Just yesterday I was talking to my oncologist and mentioned that if we have to start chemo again I intend to go into palliative care this time. He smiled at me, shrugged and said ""so just give up and do nothing?"" My jaw dropped for a moment... I said ""Uh no.. palliative care is not hospice. Its about treating the emotional and pain needs of a patient to make things as easy as possible for them during serious life threatening illness. He instantly smiled and was like yeah yeah like he understood exactly... but clearly he didnt even know what I was actually referring to until I explained a bit more. And THIS is why patients dont get the kind of care they need beyond treatment for the disease itself. Because the people who are supposed to steer them to the right help and services are so busy 'living life' doing their own serious work that they dont have the time to be educated about what is out there I guess. An oncologist of ALL people should be the one helping patients treat their whole system and not just the cancer.

Summarized from Dr. Gawande: ""A landmark 2010 study from Mass Gen had even more startling findings. The researchers randomly assigned 151 patients with Stage IV lung cancer to one of two possible approaches to treatment. Half received usual oncology care. The other half received usual oncology care plus parallel visits visits with a palliative care specialist. The result: those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - *and they lived 25% longer.*""

sparklyenema,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_86g5v5,5,dw521ka,"I’m sorry to hear about your grandma. Stage 4 generally means the cancer is no longer curable, but there are therapies available that are palliative, meaning they could help increase either the quality or quantity of your life— there will always side effects to treatments. Metastatic breast cancer (when it goes to other places like brain/ bone/ lungs)  means it is stage 4. You can have treatments that may help temporarily put the “pause button” on cancer and slow it down, but it will continue to progress. 

You beat cancer by living the best you can with whatever time you’ve got in life. Who knows when that time will be... 
 Live each day with nothing in your heart left unsaid. 


Time can vary greatly from person to person depending on a variety of things including the genetics of the cancer, the general health of the individual prior to cancer diagnosis, and luck. Doctors don’t always have crystal balls, but her doctor may or may not be able to give better insight for how much time someone may have. They will usually describe it as: days to weeks, weeks to months, or months to years. This may give some better guidance for you, so grandma can focus on living well and living the life she wants with the time she has left. 

That is hard news to receive. I hope you’re doing okay. ",t3_86g5v5,,2018-03-23 02:18:55,/r/cancer/comments/86g5v5/my_grandma/dw521ka/,,,
tocina,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_899rsn,3,dwqem5b,"Liver mets are not an immediate death sentence. With proper treatment to knock the cancer back, the liver is capable of regenerating.

The most pressing problem seems to be that the MRSA infection is delaying treatment. If the liver mets compromise her liver too much, she might not be eligible for chemo. But, the liver is capable of regenerating with only 10% of it viable. It's an amazing organ.

She has Stage 4 cancer, meaning that the cancer has developed in an area that is not the original site. Stage 4 is terminal, *eventually*. Some people live for years with treatment. Some people even go into remission for a time. How do I know this? I've had Stage 4 breast cancer for 6 years now, and it is in my liver and bones.

She needs to focus on getting her body as strong as possible so that she can endure treatment. This means eating as much as she can, as well as she can, and getting as much gentle exercise as she can bear. Right now, that just might mean a stroll down the hospital hallways.

If her oncologist seems to be writing her off, get a second opinion.

In communicating with her, keep your fear to yourself. She will have enough trouble managing her own worry, she doesn't need to manage yours as well. I have found myself comforting family members about my cancer far too often. 

She's a big girl, and should have no trouble understanding her medical situation, unless she is experiencing cognitive difficulties. Antibiotics, and opiates for pain, can make a person loopy, so do keep an eye on her intellectual processing and mention it immediately if she doesn't seem herself. If she's been in the ICU long enough, that alone can cause some transient dementia. All the noise and lights causing a lack of sleep can degrade her mental status.

Your job is to support her, to make sure she has food and care at home, and to transport to and from medical appointments. She will also need help around the house with cleaning, groceries, and laundry while she is in treatment. Stage 4 treatment is not as enervating as early stage treatment, because it is palliative rather then curative, so they use lower doses of the chemotherapies, but it adds up. So, if she is living on her own, get her the support she will need.

I can tell that you love her very much. You will be an important part of her treatment, and your care will help to make what time she has left as good as possible.

Things are not looking good. I was pulled off an oral chemo two months ago due to blood clots. Now the oncologist is hesitant to put me on another chemo because my blood counts are low and my body weight continues to be low. I have tried over several months to put on weight but it is just not working. High protein and calorie drinks, icecreams, pbj sandwiches, mashed potatoes - name it, I have tried them.

Add to that, my daily terrible stomach pains, nausea, bloating and all other issues makes it extremely difficult for me to eat or drink like a normal person. I guess its just the nature of the disease or cachexia.

So after having gone through the standard cancer treatments - chemo, radiation, surgery, chemo...my options are at a dead end. The oncologist said that without treatment I could last perhaps a few weeks, months to a year - he cannot really say. And even if I were to get chemo, it won't help me much, maybe add a little more time to the inevitable.

So, I guess thats it. I lost my wife to another non-related cancer a few years ago. She was 38. And now I am facing death before reaching 50. My son who is majoring in Biology because he wants to be a doctor (A determined decision made by him after his mom's death) will unfortunately become an orphan.

They discovered a medulloblastoma on my cerebllum on Jan 16 and the tumor was entirely removed on Jan 18. My first section of treatment includes weekly chemo (vincristine) and 6 weeks of craniospinal radiation. I had a spinal tap as well as MRIs of my entire brain and spine and everything is clear. Right now they are trying to make sure it doesn't come back.

Craniospinal radiation has been a killer. I've been hospitalized throughout, vomiting blood for the damage to my insides, and extremely fatigued. I've lost 22 pounds in 5 weeks. I have 1 more week to go. After this, they want to give me a month off to recover and then start a year of very heavy, platinum-based chemo. They said by completing this treatment, I'll have a 60-80% chance of it not coming back.

Considering how hellish this has been, i've decided not to do the year of chemo. I'm depressed and sick and weak and i want my life back. 60-80% doesn't comfort me too much either. My doctors are obviously pushing for the year of chemo, they've admitted they tend to ""overtreat."" (I'm at a top cancer facility). However, there's no way in hell I'm extending this process for another year. I hear stories of people who completely ignored treatment and lived amazing lives and others who died shortly after. I feel if I keep up with my scans I can catch it before it comes back and then I can try alternative treatment.

You have the choice between chemotherapy and scam.

There are such scam institutes charging upto $300,000 selling these fake 'alternative' treatments, beware of them as they are mostly based on magic and witch Afro-Mexican magic treatment. One of them is a man named Dr Gerson whose treatment for cancer includes super expensive supplements which you have to buy everyday, and a magic coffee powder which you have to inject into your anus everyday(called Coffee enema). Most people are forced to mortgage their properties in order to pay Dr Gerson's bills, but yet nobody I know has ever survived his treatment except the guys and girls who appear on his advertisements and also sell his supplements.

Second is a man named Dr Sebi another miraculous cancer healer, he disagrees with Dr Gerson and thinks his magic is weak magic, according to Dr Sebi all illnesses in the world is caused by mucous from your nostrils going to parts of your body and giving them flu.
So mucous removing magic ointment is all you need to be immortal like Dr Sebi himself, haters will say Dr Sebi has passed away.

While I understand that some people with terminal cancer don't wish to do chemo or any treatment, I respect that thought and think everybody should have the right to make independent decisions about their life. 
If you choose to not treat your cancer, I would suggest asking your doctor for palliative treatment which will lessen your pain and other symptoms to an extent. But please don't give a single dollar to those scam artists, they will bankrupt you and your family selling false hope.
Nowadays these scam artists target immigrants and other low literacy groups because they are easier to manipulate, this news article demonstrates that :

An immigrant woman diagnosed with cancer was told by the naturopath that chemotherapy doesn't work and it turned the cancer into terminal, the immigrant's husband then killed the naturopath out of anger.

2 months ago, I lost my jeep in an explosion, went through a break-up and then was diagnosed with stage II testicular cancer all within the same week.

I found this sub today and am filled with emotion just reading everyone's stories. I'm scheduled to begin chemo next week after I have a port placed in my chest on friday. I'm 23.

Cancer showed me how little I know about this world. How little I know about what's correct or incorrect to do with your life or even your next week.

However, I decided that the purpose of life is to love those around you. And I am sitting here on my laptop at a cafe in seattle with tears welling up and I wish I could hug each and every one of you. I don't know you but I still feel a connection. I don't know what the point of this post was. I suppose I just felt the need to spill my soul. I've been very reserved with my diagnosis, only telling my close friends and my family. I deleted my social media accounts. So, to have a place where I can talk about my diagnosis and not feel like it's some sort of fucked up 'bragging' or dick-measuring contest is so relieving.

The worst part of cancer for me is seeing people's reactions when I share my diagnosis. Why did I have to be the one to bring sadness into someone else's life? I would much rather make someone smile or laugh. :( In that respect, I would rather not tell someone so that they can continue in happiness rather than be emotionally unbalanced because of my life. I do not wish to cause worry in anyone's life.

I don't know why there is so much pain in this world. But all things come to an end and whether we live or die, if we love those around us we are doing the right thing and no one can take that away from us, no one.

So to everyone reading this, let's spread our love as much as we can to everyone who will have it. Our love will never die :)"

My sister had anaplastic thyroid cancer, and it was exactly as you described. 
The waiting is excruciating. She had tests that would determine if it was anaplastic cancer or lymphoma. It's strange to be wishing that your family member has lymphoma, but that's what we were doing. I hope you get ""lucky"" and your mom has lymphoma, or something else. 

My sister  was offered 3 options.  
1. The experimental treatment, which was described as ""rough"", and for her would have involved a 4 hour drive, each way, every week for 8 weeks, to the hospital that offered it. 
2. Aggressive chemo and radiation
3. Palliative care. 

She chose 3. The thought process was that it offered 3 months of misery. The chemo offered 6 months of worse misery and the experimental treatment offered 12 months of even worse misery. 
That's how it played out. 3 months of misery with every day being worse than the one before it.

Within a month he was totally off painkillers (he was on fentanyl patches and hydromorph) and also off home oxygen (he was on 6LPM at rest). It was incredible. He went from palliative home care to teaching at the university again within 6 weeks.

He had mets in his brain, kidneys, liver, spleen, beneath the skin, jaw bone, adrenal glands, lower spine, and very significant metastasis in his lungs which is what was causing the most distress at the time they put him on the new meds. He had a craniotomy in February but at that time no other metastasis other than one small lung nodule. Two months later it was like a melanoma grenade went off.

He tried immunotherapy in early April but 9 days after starting that he couldn't breathe anymore, so things were just progressing way too fast for us to wait to see if immunotherapy would work. BRAF inhibitors work much faster for some people (like my fiancé), but most of the time the cancer becomes resistant within a year.

If your sister in law in law has the BRAF mutation and has a heavy tumour burden, it's worth asking about BRAF inhibitors. You can learn a lot about them online now since they've  been available in the US for a while now.

The only pure contraindication to a transplant is macrovascular invasion and metastasis. I don't think liver cancer would metastasize to the kidney as natural bloodflow would normally mean spread to lungs/bone area which you said is clear. Are you sure the lesion on the kidney isn't benign or just a pseudolesion and not a malignant one? I'm a strong proponent of liver transplants for liver cancer both LDLT and DDLT. Recurrence rates are significantly lower than resection which has high recurrence chances normally. Liver transplant is the only real chance for a cure. If you live in asia, take advantage of the fact that many centers offer LDLT, you don't have to wait on the waiting list for a deceased donor. As far as I know there is almost no risk to the donor and recipient of getting a liver transplant. The main disadvantage is that of course the cancer can come back, and if it does comeback, it does so more aggressively due to the immunosuppressed state of the patient. Fatalaties that occur as a direct result of transplant is close to negligible, although sepsis does occur sometimes if the immunosuppressed patient doesn't take special care to take care if themselves. Sorafenib only increases the lifespan by 2-3 months and may significantly worsen quality of life. Some people get really bad foot/hand syndrome which renders them unable to walk-&gt;too painful. Brutally honest, changing the diet won't do anything because cancer cells can only divide at a capped rate-&gt;each cell divides by two and so on. Cancer cells also draw upon the same nutrients the rest of your body's normal cells do. If you live in korea/taiwan/japan -&gt;china to an extent or have the money to fly to these countries, I would strongly advise you to and still consider getting a transplant, my dad was said to be terminal with liver cancer HCC too advanced to be resected or transplanted, he's well today, many doctors in HK/Singapore/Taiwan were strongly against the transplant saying my dad has 6-8 months left and to only do TACE+sorafenib, I argued against them based on what i've learned through reading hundreds of medical papers and in the end they all ended up agreeing that transplant was the best option. Went through with the transplant, he stayed in the hospital for one week, he was able to start walking 3 days after surgery, full recovery in like a month, he could go to the mall and stuff. he is even healthier than pre transplant, cirrhosis meant his liverfunction was at 20%. Bottomline in my opinion is, don't giveup and resign to palliative care-&gt;sorafenib/nivolumab/TACE. even if you transplant, and the cancer does come back, at least you can say you guys tried everything you could. Lots of people i've met or encountered are afraid of transplants due to not being informed enough, read more papers, it will come yourself. Also, if you plan on going for the transplant route, start the process ASAP or it may be truly too late to do anything about.

My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung cancer in 2015 and passed away 8 weeks later at 56. 

Once the cancer has reached Stage 4, any chemo is considered palliative care. This is designed to ease symptoms (though often can have more serious side effects than the cancer itself at this stage). It is not a cure, and likely will only extend life for a few extra months at this stage if successful. 

My father had a go, though only lasted one or two sessions before stopping chemo. I think he was in denial as to the outcome of chemotherapy.  Even from these little sessions he already was getting side-effects, I can't remember them all but he had begun to lose hair, which left a constant sniffle due to a lack of nose hairs. 

Realistically you should have a talk about quality vs quantity of life. Is it worth if for your father to have a few extra months which could contain side-effects, or to make the remainder of his time with you fuller? Unfortunately this isn't an easy decision. 

Is your family involved with a hospice? I would really recommend it as they provided the best care for my father and our family. Both he and I received counselling through them, and they were first port of call for any of us regarding any questions we had regarding treatment. 

If you have any more questions feel free to message me and I'll answer as best I can. It's a shitty situation for anyone to be in. All the best to you and your family &lt;3",t3_8nwbnv,,2018-06-05 14:37:39,/r/cancer/comments/8nwbnv/my_dad_decided_to_do_chemotherapy_for_stage_4/e05ghjz/,,,

My dad had an esophageal SCC. It was resistant to chemo, but partially controlled by radiaiton. We were suggested palliative as well as his was a complicated stage 3 - touching the bronchus. All the remote opinions here in the US and back home in India suggested Palliative.

That said, we were lucky to find one doctor in Mumbai who did a risky resection. All of us were 'in' on that risk. But again, consider ourselves very lucky. Keep exploring and reaching out to specialty hospitals that treat SCC enough. Happy to reccomend that hospital.

If your father's tumor turns out to be resectable, the outcome could be a lot better. It took around 2 weeks for doctors to mostly come to the conclusion that my dad's cancer is inoperable. They teased us with the idea for another 2 weeks before finally saying it couldn't be done. Back in April a doc said he has 6-8 months. 2 weeks ago his oncologists said it's now less than 6 months. He's had internal stents places and had external drainage tubes that were removed a week ago. He did a round of radiation back in April that slowed the aggressive tumor growth for a while. We'd planned palliative chemo for Friday but he was much too weak at the appointment, plus his labs didn't look great, and so he turned it down. Doc seemed to agree. They rescheduled for next week but he's just going to be even weaker than.

Right now he is in a lot of pain, discomfort, difficulty breathing (side effects of the cancer: pulmonary embolism and pleural effusion), on oxygen almost all the time, has lost 30-40 lbs, can hardly walk even his a walker, his abdomen is swollen, he's extremely constipated usually but just had bright red diarrhea, which was one of the scariest things I've ever seen. Sorry if I'm over sharing.

You're going to be the guardian now. It's going to be hard. If he's unable to work, start applying for disability and medicaid asap, and also any state benefits. If things get worse it's likely your dad may need a fulltime caregiver. I've been doing that for my dad, hopefully you and your family can take turns helping your dad if it comes to that.

Get to know the social worker or case worker overseeing your father's care (maybe this is just a VA thing?) Make sure you have a clear way to contact them, e.g. phone number or email address.

Good luck and keep updating. I know what you're going through. I was so surprised to see your post because this cancer is so rare. Stay strong.

Edit: regarding diagnosis, biopsy, PET scan, ECRP, MRI all can show it. I think the ECRP and MRI are what sealed the diagnosis with my dad, plus the presentation of secondary effects like jaundice and tenderness in the upper right quadrant of his abdomen.

Oddly enough he had been told chemo was a viable option and the oncologist was optimistic. But when he went to get his port last week they discovered a huge blood clot in his lungs that was pressing against his heart and he was admitted into the ICU for a few days. He came home for one day but was still having a hard time breathing so we went back to the emergency room and the doctors asked him what his code status was, since we hadn’t had time to fill out the “dnr or no dnr” paperwork. He was transferred up the ICU where the doctors told him his kidneys had shut down and chemo was off the table. They asked if he wanted to try to treat the kidneys and blood clots but he elected for palliative care. In 24 hours he went from being a alert and singing in the ER to being unconscious. Hospice consulted with us but said he was never going to make it out of the hospital. We did move him to a hospice room within the hospital but he passed within 20 minutes. My mom and I held his hands, sang, prayed, and told him how much we loved him. The hospice doctor said he was probably 15 minutes away from passing but at the 15 minute mark he was still breathing at a somewhat regular pace. So we told him we were ok and that he could let go. I swear he could hear us and that’s when he did let go. 

I hate how fast it was and I hope that you are given more options, but spend as much time with your mom as you can. I took FMLA leave the day he was diagnosed and have been with him the last 2.5 weeks. The doctors said he was spared from so much pain because the chemo would have caused him much more suffering and I know it’s true but I’m still in shock and grieving. 

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to vent or talk. I’ve realized that very very few people know what it’s like to be given such a terrible diagnosis and have it move so quickly. ",t3_8qihun,,2018-06-12 14:24:08,/r/cancer/comments/8qihun/having_a_hard_time/e0jk4r4/,,,

Keep in mind Palliative care is a VERY broad term when it comes to cancer.  Technically its simply care of someone whose cancer (or Illness) is not currently curable. It doesn't have to mean it will kill the person anytime soon or even at all, although normally when talking about Palliative care that is the implication (that you will die from it eventually and usually sooner rather than later).

The idea is more about making the patient's life easier, providing relief from symptoms and stress, and improving the quality of life in the time they have left, however long that may be.

I personally have seen little in the way of direct effects from my tumors themselves, but the issue is that the tumors have caused severe carcinoid syndrome, which HAS significantly hurt my quality of life and created many complications. I am currently considered disabled because of it even if I don't like that terminology.

To me, it sounds like you need to work with whomever your treatment is being taken care of by, and see about mental health support. Usually, its offered. Also look into changing your life if possible, trying something new.

**Edit:** After reading some of your replies, I really would suggest looking into other opinions or 2nd opinions from other sources if at all possible.

I don't know what my life expantcy is since I do not have a concrete diagnosis, which troubles me deeply. I am still in my twenties, but I have zero quality of life. I thought about it and I thought it was due to a botched ECT which fried my brain like rice, this happened while I was hospitalized for that last suicide attempt, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe it's due to the stress of my not-diagnosis? Either way, I'm a shell of the person I used to be as early as September of last year.

I have state Medicaid, so my options are pretty limited. Honestly, I'm just waiting for my condition to get bad enough so I can go into the hospital where hopefully I'll receive better care than I have been getting.

I am not really under any sort of ""official"" palliative care center, but where I am being treated they provide me medication to help control the syndrome, and if I need it, Therapists or Psychologists. Outside of that they have helped pave the way for things like being classified as disabled, which can help with regards to daily life (I was going back to school so it helped with flexibility there, and allowed me to apply for SSDI more easily). But the thing is, each persons Palliative care is always going to be somewhat unique to them so what I am going through may, or may not help in your case. For reference, I was not on Medicaid but on a cheap Obamacare plan at the time of my diagnosis.

What you really need is a solid diagnosis or at least clarity on what you have and your options. This will help possibly open up new avenues of help such as being referred to a specialized cancer center or treatment center. Often certain ones can help cover your costs which is very helpful in reducing stress.

I would recommend getting more opinions as I stated, but also looking into online help resources. There are some centers where you can actually apply online to be treated or seen.

Cancer treatment is extremely harsh and it may be that your grandfather is not sufficiently well enough to receive surgery or medication. You may not get all of the answers you need in just one visit. It took six weeks for me before I got a treatment plan. That was a good time to ask questions, here is a good [starting list](https://sarahcannon.com/for-patients/learn-about-cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/talking-with-doctor.dot).  
  
I spoke to quite a lot of older patients while waiting for appointments. Some do get full treatment and go on to recover. Some however get palliative care as their cancer is not treatable. In my experience oncologists do tend to be quite blunt about likely outcomes to avoid giving any false hope.  
  
I hope this helps and I hope you find out enough to start asking the right questions. I didn't stop asking questions and still do 18 months after treatment. One of the best things you can do is simply spend more time with your grandfather. It will be good for you both whatever the outcome.

zlex,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_8t3zmy,4,e14nwqw,"My advice is to wait until the staging scans are completed. When he meets with his oncologist, make sure you understand all his options and what the extent/risk of his disease is. If you are interested in non-standard treatments be certain to inquire about what clinical trials he might be eligible for.

That said, immunotherapy is jumping the gun here as far as prostate cancer treatment goes. It is a palliative treatment with non-curative intent--a last ditch treatment for men who have incurable prostate cancer that has progressed to the castrate-resistant stage (can no longer be controlled with hormone therapy). Even if the disease spreads, it can often be controlled for a very long time with hormone therapy.

That said he may never have to go down the hormone therapy / chemotherapy / immunotherapy road. So before we go there I would make sure that:

1\] Does his disease require treatment? Low-risk disease (Gleason 3+3) can be managed with surveillance.

2\] Does he have highly localized cancer (focal) that can be visualized on MRI? He may be a candidate for some form of focal therapy. This could cure his cancer / delay the need for radical treatment.

3\] If he requires radical treatment, gather as much information as possible about the risks and side effects of his treatment options (generally surgery or radiation) so that he can make the best decision for his specific diagnosis.

Finally don’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion. It’s always a good idea to get another perspective.

My mother had metastasis and passed away last year and my father passed away two months ago. So first, be patient because they are going to be very confused and sometimes they sleep pattern will change dramatically, they will forget who you are and all that. Their body might start giving in and not being so responsive. Some are lucky and can go to the bathroom and all that just fine but some don't so be prepared and maybe have a wheelchair close to her all the time.

Well be prepared that it is not an easy process and having a psychologist will make everything easier for you and your mum and also your grandma. Depending where you live there are some programs that are really helpful to reduce and relieve pain for the patient and also for the family. Palliative care is so important.

Be there for your grandma all the time, but also take some time for you everyday bc it is easy to forget about yourself in these situations. Nobody knows how long she'll REALLY be between us.

You may consider taking her to a hospital if it get's too much because sometimes they need oxygen or the pain will be too much.

Also she probably will have to take a lot of medicine so be very organised with her stuff. Buy a lot of pijamas so your grandma will be more comfortable. My mother used to feel like she was burning so we had to have our window always open because of that.

Nobody can know for sure how your grandma will be like in the future but be prepared for everything and be strong. Give her and all your family loads of love. I can only hope your experience won't be so  painful.

Radiation/Chemo runs the gamut of serious to seriously minor. Before the cancer became aggressive my dad would go in every few years to have some tissue scraped out.

The problem with metastatic cancer is that its extremely hard near impossible to treat, most if not all the time its palliative treatment, to extend your life.  The aggressive nature it seems her cancer is taking, pushing the doctors for scans and treatment might not be the best thing for her.  Chemo is very exhausting, physically and mentally.

Once the cancer starts spreading aggressive, that is when treatment fails as we still don't understand what will work and what wont.  This is very different for Primary Cancer.  There is a finite amount of treatment lines.

I also highly recommend looking into palliative care. While it is more frequently associated with hospice care palliative care is not restricted to it. Anyone who is dealing with a serious illness would benefit from palliative care or doctors who are familiar with it. 

I am finding that one of the best things I can do is to be present during doctors visits and keep as much information as I can in my phone or take down notes. It is a way to keep my thoughts organized, and I can reference doctors names, contact info, specialties, etc if I need to refer back to them about anything. 

There are going to be ups and downs, but I hope you can remember no matter how you feel in one minute it will pass. If it gets really difficult give yourself room and take a break.

RemoteLink,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_8yoa4d,3,e2d80ox,"&gt; My dad is giving up on life and I am afraid things are going out of control so fast.

This is precisely what palliative care is about, making life as tolerable for someone as possible.

I note that you say no further treatment is possible; while that is the typical point at which many people enter palliative care, it can even be done concurrently with treatment. There is evidence that it can even (modestly) prolong life in some circumstances.

Do discuss it with the doc tomorrow. Really. They probably won't just pump your dad full of morphine as a first step. But he'll be able to relax knowing it's there if/when he needs it. In the interim, there's a host of things that can be done to alleviate suffering and make him as comfortable as he can be, and get the most of the time he has left.",t3_8yoa4d,,2018-07-14 08:09:38,/r/cancer/comments/8yoa4d/pain_and_paliative_care_has_anyone_any_info/e2d80ox/,r/cancer,,
woodsbill,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_8yoa4d,7,e2dhzz8,"Having had these same questions and discussions with various doctors over the last few weeks, I'll share what I've learned for whatever it's worth.

""Palliative"" care differs from ""Curative"" care in that Palliative is how to make Quality of Life better - reducing pain, depression and other physical symptoms of the disease vs trying to cure the disease. It can include changes to medical and physical regimens as well as counseling to address the various physical and mental discomforts.

Sometimes ""Palliative"" care is equated to ""Hospice"" care, but there's an overlap. All Hospice care includes Palliative care - they're trying to improve your quality of life. But Hospice care is aimed at people with terminal progressions, so it includes on-call assistance, bereavement counseling before and after passing and more, whether it is in-home hospice care or in-facility Hospice care. 

If your Dad is in pain, definitely get the Palliative care discussions going - focus on pain management through med adjustment is normally where they start. At some point it may turn into a discussion on Hospice care... just be ready for that as it's one thing to be able to focus on the day to day management, it's another thing to start discussing end of life care.

Standard chemo does not really work on this type of cancer, the time you are buying is maybe a month and is it quality time? 

Unless there is a clinical trial you can get her in, I would suggest palliative care, you can still do alternative treatments under palliative care.

sujayhegde,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_9098f9,3,e2pfgca,"Hi, I'm facing a similar situation. My dad's 55, got diagnosed with advanced renal cell carcinoma (papillary cell type 2). The treating doctor told me it's particularly rare and aggressive. The latter is very true, since he had lesions all over the place, including the brain. He barely had any symptoms other than weight loss, fever, and loss of appetite. Misdiagnosis for more than 5 months. Finally caught it at its most severe form. The goal of treatment was palliative. Radiation to the brain and then to the bone lesions, which were everywhere. So they just gave it whenever he experienced pain. 

Started him with Pazopanib (Votrient) for 15 days. His bone marrow wasn't generating enough platelets, so it was stopped. Doctor asked us to comfort him at home for as long as he lives. This devastation was the worst since he was tolerating the therapy and was improving. Now, a month after stopping the treatment, his memory is fading. He sometimes talks in another language and doesn't respond to whatever we say. Just stares and sleeps. 

I hope your father has a clear cell variant, because that has a better response. If he hasn't lost his appetite, then he'll have strength to tolerate any form of treatment. Stage IV cancer sucks, I know. I managed throughout by reading several papers online and understood the grim truth. I can now see the disease progressing.

Also - make sure your health care proxy is someone who will do what you want, not what they want.  Don't choose your mom or dad if they aren't 100% going to honor your wishes by making sure you are comfortable when the time comes.

lorabore,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_91sis8,3,e30k7kp,"First thing is double check with insurance and home care. I worked in home care hospice for years and insurance, including Medicare part A &amp; B would cover home care for any patient who required skilled nursing or physical therapy. 

Skilled nursing can be anything like medication set-up, insulin administration, wound care, etc. And once a nurse is providing in home care, insurance will cover a CNA to come help with ADLs like showering. The patient doesn't have to be unable to get to the bathroom in order for a CNA to help. So I would strongly encourage you to talk to insurance again and even go as far as getting his oncologist to write an order for home health and see if the agency themselves can convince insurance. 

Outside of that, you can also hire a home care aide to do private duty without insurance reimbursement. It can be as little as having someone come 3 times a week to shower him to even having someone everyday. 

Who is managing his palliative care? If his pain is intractable and being managed by his oncologist, I would recommend a referral to pain management or even a palliative care specialist.

This is the Hospice we are signed up with https://www.hollandhospice.org/palliative-care-2/

(From their website)
Medicare will pay for a physician consult.

Palliative care patients benefit from:
•Helping patients understand the course of the disease or illness.
•Hospice of Holland’s expertise in managing complex physical and emotional symptoms
•A palliative care team including a physician, registered nurse and social worker
•Help resolving questions about goals of care and treatment options
•Improved patient/family communication, help with family meetings, and coordination of multiple sources of care
•Decreased symptoms and anxiety
•Assessing the potential value of introducing pastoral and counseling resources to help patients and families cope with the transitions they are facing.
•A comfortable new palliative care outpatient clinic at 270 Hoover Blvd in Holland, or when necessary, visits at their home or nursing facility.

I don't really care for them, but my sister is his medical advocate and she chose this one.
So pretty much his skilled nurse I want to say she is, comes once weekly to his home and does his medications in a timed pill box for the week, weighs him and just observes him overall. That's about the extent of it.
His social worker has helped to try and find options for us, so she directly contacted DHS but then DHS said that they won't cover anything if we doesn't need it yet ( I don't know that's just what they state, because she did a visit with my dad, without us  there and he said he didn't need it, he's very stubborn and doesn't understand that is a lot for me and my sister to take on.)
My dad doesn't have private insurance. And My sister and I can't afford to pay monthly for a private CNA or facility. So we are relying heavily on his insurance through the state to cover everything or most.

I will definitely call his insurance provider again and look into it!
He is not seeing his oncologist anymore since he stopped treatment. But has a palliative care doctor through hospice. But how that works is my dad will tell us or the nurse of he's hurting, but he's always in pain but when they ask him usually he's says he's fine...then the nurse will put a request in to the doctor to up his pain medication. So yeah, it needs to be approved by the doctor before he can get any relief. But like I stated before, he will say things are fine and then when its just us he will tell us how much he's hurting. He's very prideful. Not only does my dad have cancer, he has onset dementia due to a stroke he had, he's also had a major heart surgery prior to his cancer diagnosis...so its just a lot to deal with.

lindab,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_924znt,17,e336woh,"Merriam-Webster defines end stage as ""being or occurring in the final stages of a terminal disease or condition""

I'm not an expert but it's my understanding that when doctors say it's end stage it means that there is nothing left that doctors are willing to do to try to remove or reduce the cancer (usually because they have tried everything and are out of options, or because there is a reason the patient wouldn't be able to survive the treatments). At that point they focus on palliative care to try to keep the patient as comfortable as possible. 

Stage 4 is the most advanced stage of cancer. There is no stage 5. But there are many stage 4 patients that are receiving aggressive treatments and having good results. For these patients, the doctors are still offering treatment options to try to at least reduce the cancer and extend lifespan. 

So my understanding is that all end stage cancer patients are stage 4, but not all stage 4 cancer patients are referred to as end stage. I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong. You're right that there isn't a lot of information out there on this topic.

I would suggest getting on the phone with someone from PanCAN's clinical trial matching service, because clinical trials are going to be your best bet. 

Push for molecular profiling of the tumor (Know Your Tumor is a great service PanCAN can provide as well--make sure your doctor is working with someone who can get those results fast, because everything you do now determines what trials your dad will be eligible for. If the doctor starts him on chemotherapy tomorrow, that may open some doors on certain trials and close them for others, so try to have as much info as possible ready when you talk with PanCAN. 

They're a great resource, just make sure they have the same info as the doctors.

Finally, get your dad a good palliative care nurse. That person will be indispensable in managing the symptoms and side effects of treatment. My dad would have been in so much pain if we hadn't found someone.

palmtop_tiger,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_e4ctwwe,1,e4d7qvm,"Thank you. I don't mind sharing now. It's becoming slightly easier to talk about it and I realize that I need to rather than bottling it up. 

My mom was hospitalized for the last 3 months of her life so the experience would be different in my case since there was no home care. The thing that mattered most to her in terms of helping out was having us there. She was bedridden and too sick to leave her hospital room, meaning that the only people she really saw were the nurses unless we came to see her. So honestly I prioritized just BEING with her regardless of what the hospital already had taken care of (bathroom, meds, etc). We made sure to try and eat together in her hospital room (I helped set up her tray and cut her food) so that she wouldn't feel weird eating alone. I went on errands for her and picked up things she wanted.
A big part of this is going to be helping your mom. I think having two caretakers is essential. Your mom will be worn down and stressed, and having a well rested caretaker will in turn be a big help for your dad.

We initially got the ""we'll wait and see"" but we began pressing with ""what's the typical outcome of her condition"" and ""should be begin preparing for palliative care"" or ""what happens if the radiation does not work?"" We got tired of the sunshine and butterflies when we knew something was seriously wrong. And that's when doctors began to say ""I'm so sorry"" rather than ""we can definitely still treat this; we'll see"".

However, I will say that my mom's passing was primarily caused by viral influenza that caused pneumonia rather than the spinal mets itself. She was 7 days into 15 days of radiation treatment on her spinal lymphoma when taken to ICU. 2 Days before ICU they were talking about discharging her back to her home 3.5 hours away (she was at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL rather than at home) for rehab for the legs. Do not give up hope on him despite a scary prognosis or the spinal lymphoma. I know Mantle Cell Lymphoma is scary, but be a cheerleader all the way through. It's not over till it's over.

McKermit,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_9aco54,6,e4ugsv3,"I'm so sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis; I will keep your family in my prayers.

I am not a physician (but am a public health researcher). It's likely that your mother's treatment plan is palliative rather than curative, which designed to keep the tumors at the same size and prevent further spread, while prolonging life to the extent possible and minimizing sequela from the cancer. There are pros and cons to palliative chemotherapy, the side effects from which you may not see until treatment begins.

It's hard to give a realistic estimate for how long your mother will live because it will vary wildly by patient. My father, for example, went from diagnosis to death in seven weeks (stage IV lung cancer); my friend's mother who also had advanced lung cancer lived three years. I would take data available on the Internet with a grain of salt, as these estimates represent national survival rates often aggregated across disease stage, patient age/gender, access to care, and treatment type; they also are a few years old, and some types of cancer treatment have advanced rapidly.

I know it's an uncomfortable conversation, but I hope you get a chance to ask questions of your mother's oncologist/care team. They will have her medical history and treatment plan on hand and are well equipped to talk about life expectancy and objectives for her care.

lydiav59,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_9e3ptt,24,e5m2i1r,"I am so sorry for both of you. I normally just lurk here because I don't know what to say, but I think I can help you a little.

A bit over a year ago, my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. His treatments are palliative, not curative. The first 3 months after his diagnosis were a whirlwind of doctor's appts. and tests. I learned very early on to take a notebook with me and take notes. We were both so mentally shut down that neither of us remembered much of what we were told.

DO NOT be afraid to ask questions, and keep asking them until you understand the answer. DO NOT be afraid to question a doctor if you think something in her care is inappropriate.

I used to work in health care. If any of the people I interacted with asked me about their health, I always told them to educate themselves as much as possible in order to make truly informed decisions about their care, and seek a second opinion if they felt they needed it.

My husband had 2 rounds of aggressive chemo that did nothing for his cancer. Oddly enough, he also had no side effects. He still ate like a horse, didn't lose his hair, literally like they gave him saline solution. They then moved him on to biologics. His worst complaint is exhaustion. Everyone reacts differently to treatment, Just roll with her reactions, if she has them. 

I've tried to learn about the possible side effects of every treatment he's had. If I need to pick up antacids,  antidiarrhea meds, Gatorade, cough meds, etc., I pick some up to have on hand just in case. If we never use them, great. If something comes up in the middle of the night, I've hopefully got what he needs to help him immediately.

I bring a bag with me to his treatments. I've got a notebook for him if he feels like browsing the internet. I carry pain killers and anxiety pills if he needs them. It seems like all of the treatment centers we've gone to (he just also started emergency radiation 2 weeks ago)  have warm blankets. You might want to throw in a pair of cuddly socks.

Don't jump to do everything for her. I did that in the beginning and it made him feel useless. If she wants to do something for herself, let her give it a try. If she can't, let her know it isn't a big deal, and she can always try again tomorrow, or later in the day if she wants to.

If she does get chilled at home, throw a blanket in the drier. My husbands new biologic does give him chills occasionally, he loves a warm blanket! Also, get a small fan that you can put in front of her if she has hot flashes from chemo.

If you guys own anything, and don't have wills, get that taken care of.

Don't turn her into her cancer. Don't make every conversation about it, try to be as normal as possible. My sister-in-law died at 44 from breast cancer. I remember her telling me at one point that she no longer felt like her, she had become her cancer. She said no one would talk to her about normal things, everyone always focused on her cancer. After that I was always aware of just passing the time of day with her, and I've been very careful about not robbing my husband of as much normalcy as I can give him.

Find at least one thing to laugh about every, single day.

I'm guessing her prognosis isn't great. If she's interested, maybe look into clinical  trials? My husband was given about 6 months or less to live. That was a little over a year ago. He still has quality of life. Not like it used to be, but he can still occasionally go out in the yard and putter around on his lawn tractor. He still enjoys so many things.

And, you'll hear this all the time, take care of yourself. I've always been haphazard at best about taking care of myself. The first month after his diagnosis, I burned out incredibly fast. I'm now super conscious of my own health. Mentally and physically I'm better able to take care of him and deal with all of the changes that can happen in the blink of an eye.

You'll find your footing again, it won't be what was normal before, but will be your new normal, and that's okay.

If you're into remission and curing isn't possible, the aim of treatment would be palliative - relieving symptoms of cancer but not curing it.   
We are interested in attitudes towards dying no matter what stage or cancer you have been diagnosed with, as our aim is to explore factors that influence these attitudes. As you mentioned, type of cancer and its stage are few of them.

&amp;#x200B;

It is certainly possible to diagnose cancer just on a CT scan. Sometimes it can be tough where there's just one mass being investigated, and a PET scan can help confirm it is cancer and/or determine if it has spread elsewhere, but in situations where it has already spread to the brain and lungs, a PET scan is unlikely to change the management. Biopsy can sometimes be very helpful to determine what type of cancer it is and what types of treatment it would respond to, but if people have a rapidly declining condition, then putting them through a biopsy may be too much. Also if they would be too unwell for the treatment, then doing the biopsy would also not change the management. The doctors may have a very good guess as to the type of cancer and how likely it is that the most common treatments would be effective. 

&amp;#x200B;

 From what you've said they were considering radiation to help with her symptoms, but she did not attend - it will be important to talk to her about why if she is able.  Your role is to make sure that any treatments she receives are in line with what she would want. It may be that she is choosing a palliative/comfort care approach that can be very reasonable. I don't know about her region but sometimes saying this explicitly gets access to all kinds of different services that can help.

MHS1,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_9i19yg,1,e6jgzz4,"Hi!

First of all let me say I'm sorry for the situation that you are in with your mother. I know how tough it is. My mom was diagnosed with metastasized gallbladder cancer in April 2016. We lost her on June 21st of this year. It's nice of you to try and increase the information out there on this treatment, so I will try to add to it a bit since my mom also received 5FU for a couple of months. 

So my mom didn't have pancreatic cancer, but since gallbladder cancer is really rare the treatments weren't that different since there aren't a lot of tailored treatments out there so it's really making do with what's out there. Also, similar complications are to be expected, like blocked bile ducts etc. 

Even though gallbladder cancer is described to be extremely lethal and rapidly progressing which we knew from the start, we had over 2 years with my mother after diagnosis. She was extremely positive and strong, and we tried to be as well, which I think is very important and really does increase health/life expectancy. So try to keep the spirits high when you can, it will both give you important and beautiful memories of this challenging time, as well as make your mother more resilient mentally to handle her treatment. 

My mom received two types of chemo therapy, which I assume also stalled the progression of the disease. In the first year she received Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, and when that stopped working after 8 months or so, she started an experimental treatment with 5FU. In addition to 5FU, she simultaneously received Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin, so this has affected her (reaction to) the treatment of course. She received this mix for I think close to 9 months. 

Before she started we were also warned that this chemo-mix would be a lot tougher than the first one, that she would most likely lose her hair, and it might make her really sick. So yes - the chemo was more intense than the first one. But my mom didn't lose her hair and she endured it relatively well. Of course this all depends on the person, the disease and the circumstances. But all in all she and the other people I saw in the hospital receiving this treatment seemed a bit better than I expected after being warned about the intensity of the treatment. 

My mother received her chemo-mix every 21 days, for 3 days intravenously (this was the 5FU). Usually she would feel weak(er), have way less energy and not have much of an appetite for 4-5 days after that. After that she'd start to get better again, and her energy would go up again as well. The one thing that she increasingly struggled with was constipation, for which she took magnesium pills which helped her tremendously. 

She also complained about a metallic taste, but this wasn't as bad as when she received Cisplatin. She also got a bit sensitive to cold drinks/ice, but we think this might have been due to the Irinotecan. 

From what I've seen, the loss of energy and appetite start lasting longer once the number of administrations of the chemo go up. So the 9th subsequent time might be a lot more difficult to bounce back from than the first and second. Discuss chemo breaks with your doctor. You don't want to push her into being super weak and sick when she could still have better and more active times. This of course depends also on whether this is a curative or palliative treatment plan. It was the latter for my mom so we focused a lot on quality of life and I cannot stress enough how important that is. We planned her chemo's around a couple of vacations we went one, not the other way around and we don't regret it for one second. 

Usually those first days I'd just ask her if there was any type of food that she did feel like eating, and then I or my family would prepare it. I liked making nutritious soups for her, with lots of vegetables, and maybe for example sweet potatoes which contain fiber but also have a sweet taste. But it really depended on the week what she felt like. If she felt like fries, we'd get fries. At some point we also found a bakery that baked ""chemo-bread"" with all different kinds of flavors. She tried a couple, liked some. But it didn't make a great difference for her. But maybe you could look around in your neighborhood to see if there is something like that out there. 

Nearing the end she wasn't on chemo anymore, but she wouldn't be able to really digest fats anymore and then eating became a really big problem. But luckily my mom remained quite healthy for most of the time she had left and the real struggles didn't last much longer than a month. 

That's all that comes to mind right now about the treatment, but feel free to ask me other things and I can try to remember. Also feel free to vent if you need to. I'm wishing you, your mom and family lots of strength and positive energy. Try to make her laugh every time you see her, it will help you stay strong as well.

TheDreebs,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_e6jgzz4,1,e6k275w,"Thank you so much for this response and helping to add to the info about this treatment plan. I'm so sorry you lost your mother and I'm wishing you lots of healing. I'm grateful for you that you had more time than what was expected.

We have also had a lot more time than was expected. She was diagnosed 2 years ago next week. At diagnosis she was told without chemo she would die from liver failure within weeks. We prepared for the worst and hoped for the best at that point. 

I still cant believe she has lasted this long sometimes but i dont dare jinx it. I moved back home to be with her and I have zero regrets. I agree with you that positive thinking helps a lot. She has definitely been strong and positive. Determined to beat this against all odds. 

This chemo is not considered to be curative for her but I highly doubt she will consider chemo breaks until she fully accepts that it cant be beaten, if that makes sense? I dont push her in the area of acceptance because survival is what is keeping her positive. I suppose j always figured we would cross that bridge when we get there. When things start to look bleak, when her Dr is out of options, then I'll be able to support her there bc she will be ready. 

I've looked into lots of palliative plans ahead of this bc I know it's coming. I dont discuss that with her bc she is very ""dont tell me the odds"" haha. I love her for that. Some would call that denial. I dont see it that way with her. She knows she can beat statistics by staying positive and she has already done that by living this long. 

At current glance of the Onivyde/5FU treatment for her pancreatic cancer the projection is that it adds 2 months to an otherwise 4 month survival rate at this point. My job is to sit on that knowledge and support her as time goes on. 

She was on Gemcitabine and Abraxane for the first 1 1/2 basically. Very similar to your mother's treatments. I've never know anyone with gallbladder cancer and you've given me some extra awareness today for sure. My wish for both of us is that we can make a difference by leaving knowledge for others. Information can be hard to take but also a comfort even when it's bad news. It lets you know where you're headed. 

Thanks again for adding to the info here. Best wishes for your future and hopes for so much healing &lt;3",t3_9i19yg,,2018-09-24 16:41:20,/r/cancer/comments/9i19yg/moms_updates_part_2_onivyde_fluorouracil_5fu/e6k275w/,r/cancer,,
fireflygirl1013,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_9inxmt,5,e6l5f7g,"As a physician that deals with end-of-life care, and former leukemia survivor, when physicians use the term “run its course”, it means that there really is no treatment left that will be effective to kill off the cells that are causing the leukemia. There’s no definite timeframe of how much time is left, but often, the times that I have given to patients or have heard from other physicians run in the six months or 12 month range.

We also didn't really discuss palliative care in those terms until it became very clear she was deteriorating. Whatever works to keep the spirits high, go for that :) We were always focusing on fun things, planning trips or outings, or even just small gatherings. We turned everything into a celebration. 

On a side note though, my sister (who is a doctor) and I did at some point start talking with my mom asking her about how she would envision her funeral. Which was a really difficult thing to do, but we kind of approached it in a ""it's not going to happen anytime soon, but when it eventually does, what would your wishes be"" kind of way. These conversations turned out to be about 1 to 2 months before her passing, and we were really happy that we had had them. It helped us planning the celebration of her life that she had envisioned. We knew the location, the music and the tone of the day she would have wanted, and that to us was a way of comfort. But it's difficult to know when to have these talks.

Start treatment or at least get plugged in and get second opinion at a large cancer center where they have clinical trials.

Make sure your wife stays in the best shape possible, physically. She will need to be in excellent health to endure treatment and the toll the cancer will take on her body.

Get plugged in with supportive/palliative medicine early in the course to control symptoms.

It will respond to treatment, if one treatment does not work, then we will try the next one. Once established treatments are exhausted, then we will go to phase I clinical trials. Some phase I clinical trials with immunotherapy may provide that very rare miracle, 1 in a million.

As to your question regarding your grandmother's life expectancy, I cannot honestly say. Pancreatic cancer/mets is a rather aggressive form of cancer along with stage IV lung cancer.

I have one suggestion for you: don't worry too much about the days she has left and worry more about making those days count, to give them meaning.

A friend of mine gave me an embroidery kit thingy when my husband was back in the hospital for a couple weeks, and I tried it because I love that friend, and I just ... I hate it. I hate it so much. Knitting, sewing, anything intricate with hand-eye coordination ... aaaack

I don't write in a journal or talk to a counsellor. I went to counselling a couple times, but just didn't find it too helpful -- I didn't like crying for an hour in front of a stranger!! Maybe it was just that counsellor, though. She is also the same counsellor my husband talks to, and that felt really weird to me. I try to just have fun where I can.

I also love my job, like you! It's an awesome distraction. I really love work and school. Losing time to spend on those is another big cancer loss, sadly. I used to be a pretty ambitious person, but there's just not time. It's impossible to plan for hospital stays, emergencies, etc. My husband was really messed up after his diagnosis (emergency craniotomy +  lots of brain radiation + other treatments + very fast-advancing cancer), which is why I had to leave work for a while -- there just wasn't time to do everything for him and also work full-time. But then I found more resources and he stabilized, so I could go back. 

I've found lately the thing that best helps my mood is just symptom control for my husband. Specifically pain control. When his pain is well-managed, I feel a lot better. It's just REALLY hard to feel normal when he is in hellish pain. Even though the cancer is progressing and he's in palliative care, the thing that really just stresses me out is when he's in pain.

I'm 27 and also lost my Dad really unexpectedly last year. Nobody I know my age has even lost a parent yet let alone a partner, or even had to care for a partner with a serious/terminal illness. So it's been a really freaking weird year.

The counsellor I use is mostly via an encrypted message platform and I've sobbed and typed many a time. I also have the option to call or video chat with them but haven't chosen to do so yet. I also hate crying in front of people! I feel like I'm weird because I've cried at work, with HR, with friends, on the phone, to the Dr (usually situations when I'm trying harder NOT to be emotional), but I have not really broken down with my partner - nor he with me. I think we're trying to be strong with and for each other. 

It was also difficult when he was getting started with treatment and that's around the time that I took off work to take him to have his port put in, explore a clinical trial option, to his first chemo, and wanted to be with him for all of the initial Dr appointments too. Now we've got a better handle on things as well. 

It's so hard to carve time out for our own interests when we're caring for a partner, but I do my darndest to find the time. Even if it's just scrolling through Pinterest or reading for 30 mins in the evening. 

I also feel the same way about feeling better when the symptoms/suffering are well controlled.

If you find that there is truly nothing left in the way of options, which does happen, I agree with the other poster that it’s time to look into hospice. 

Hospice is a big and scary word and many people take it to mean that time left is very limited. That isn’t necessarily true. Hospice is now just another term for palliative care and your dad may have the full 3 months  before his time is officially up. If you cannot manage home hospice care, research hospice homes in your area. The one that mom went to in the end felt like a 5 star resort rather than a hospice home, there are some nice ones out there. 

Most of all, take time to care for yourself, too. Make sure you’re eating well and taking some downtime here and there. This isn’t easy on your dad, but it will also take its toll on you and your family. Try and minimize that impact by practicing self-care. It’s easier said than done, but it’s important.

Noexit007,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ac5tfo,12,ed5r1e9,"Just a quick story. When I was diagnosed I was told there was no current cure, and that all treatments would be palliative. The docs said, 5-10 years. They refused to call it terminal because with 5-10 years the idea is that additional treatments or delay tactics will come along, and maybe even a curative treatment since 10 years is a long time in research.  I spent the first few months after the diagnosis getting treatments and going through surgeries, but also feeling incredibly guilty.  

Why?  

Because I felt stuck in-between 2 types of diagnosis.  I felt like I would have rather just been told I was terminal within a year or two, and been able to accept that and live my life until it ended the way I wanted to.  Or, conversely, I wished I would have been told that there were curative options and that while my life would be bumpy, I would still be able to live a fairly long life and move forward with life plans.

And I felt guilty that when given at least 5-10 years of life, which is more than many are given, I would feel like wanting less would be one of the better options. I felt suck you see. Stuck with an uncertain future that was somehow too long and too short at the same time.  I still feel that way, but have come to accept it and have tried to push forward with my life the best I can.

I tell you this story because I want you to realize that there are all sorts of sides and levels to ANY diagnosis. All you can do is accept whatever it is, look at the bright sides of each, and move forward.  

So if you are given just a year or so, then you make the most out of the time you have left, go on an adventure if you can, spend time with family and friends, and forget the troubles of the world around you.  

Now... as for your other questions... I personally am not religious, however, I do believe that we are made up of energy and that when our bodies die, the energy simply folds back into the world around us, before finding a new shell in which to inhabit.

It started with several visits to the hospital to drain fluids from her right lung. After several xrays and CT scans, we were asked to do a biopsy. Health care in my part of the world is very poor. It took over a month to get an intervention radiologist to perform a biopsy at the government hospital. The doctors adviced that we start chemotherapy after the diagnosis. We were adviced by other professionals of the effects and chances of survival with stage 4 lung cancer on chemotherapy. After a month of trying some natural remedies we decided to go ahead with the chemotherapy. 

Mum had to undergo the chemotherapy in a plastic chair as there were no beds in the hospital. It took over 8 hours per session. She was very weak and pale afterwards. Same with the second session. She lost her hair and couldn't eat anything. The third chemo nearly killed her. My beautiful mum had turned into a 100 year old woman. She required assistance with everything and almost anything that came out of her had blood in it. On the 4 review the doctors said she couldn't take it any longer and recommended palliative care. The chemotherapy had made mum worse off.

We had to move her from the city to our hometown to be with relatives and family friends. Now her room like that of an emergency room with an oxygen tank, several bottle morphine, antibiotics and all kinds of medicines to manage the symptoms. Every now and then she cries out of pain and wishes that noone ever goes through what she is going through.

You need to find a way to take a break. You can't be a good caregiver when you're in this state. Loosing your daughter on top of all this adds a whole other dimension to how your mind is processing everything. Does he have a visiting nurse?

You can't do this alone. It's okay and necessary to ask for help. Find a relaxing hobby you can do while caring for your father, such as coloring, crosswords, listening to podcasts, etc. 

Contact his hospital and see what options there are for both you and him for social workers. See if you can arrange to meet with one and have one stop by during his next hospital appointment. Don't be afraid to bring up palliative care with his doctors either. They will likely tell him that it doesn't mean giving up. My husband sees a palliative care specialist and is also actively going through treatment. There are some physical pains that won't go away and so he has to just learn to manage them.

I have definitely become more open to various ideas as it pertains to relationships. Where before I was looking for someone my age or slightly younger, single, without kids, and ready for a long term thing, now I am much more open. Whether that's a single mom, a non-monogamous situation, or an older/younger woman who I would not have considered before. It's odd how seeing your mortality relaxes your opinions somewhat and opens up your eyes a bit. Granted, I was already pretty open-minded due to how I was raised.

Of course, as it pertains to women with kids, part of me feels it's not responsible due to how unknown my future is, and the possibility of a much shorter lifespan. Currently, no cure, with a 50% over 5-year survival rate, although being younger and healthy otherwise is working for me here and docs are confident in 10+ years palliative. Being on SSDI, living with my folks, and limited in ability to work doesn't help lol! It is what it is, but damn if it doesn't suck.

&gt;I have also dealt with the depression that comes with cancer. I was never really suicidal, but there were days where I was ready to not wake up.

I also have never felt suicidal, although in large part I felt that's more due to feeling like such a drastic step would hurt my family and those who loved me, rather than anything else. But I definitely feel you on the not waking up deal.

&gt;I’ve been so fortunate to have gone through this with my fiancé. I’m truly lucky to have him. He’s amazing. 

That's good to hear. Its great to have a support structure. Without my parents and sisters, I would have likely crawled into a hole and just waited to die. They keep me from falling too far.

&gt; So you’re in DC? I am an excellent wingman if you want to get together! I promise! 

I am in Arlington. Are you from DC yourself? I would be open to meeting up and chatting or something. I am fairly introverted and quiet but you only live once right? Feel free to PM me.

I am male and at 34 now I am still trying to date, but having a cancer, especially one that I will likely be dealing with the rest of my life (palliative not curative treatments at this time), and one that has some embarrassing side effects, has not helped. I was already a bit of an introverted and shy person, who has had some life struggles and I got diagnosed just as I was getting my life together and having a blast dating.

I will say that having cancer has opened my mind a bit when it comes to a potential partner. Before I was looking for a woman slightly younger than me, single, with no attachments who wanted to be exclusive.  Now I am open to women way younger or even older, with kids or without, and hell, even non-monogamy oriented relationships. Who I find attractive has broadened, and my willingness to date someone else struggling with a health issue or disability has increased.

Yet, I still get precious little interest. I know I am not a catch. I am decent looking and healthy (apart from the cancer), but I am a shy, introverted individual on Social Security Disability and living with my parents while being treated in my 30's. Women just walk the other way.

I am trying. Mainly via online apps/sites, but every day I feel like giving up and just resigning myself to being alone for good. And every day I tell myself, well... maybe tomorrow.

You are 24 (still young), and it sounds like you can beat your cancer. You have time. If part of it is about wanting the kid to have another parental figure in their life, there are options outside of dating.  It also sounds like you realize you don't NEED someone which is good because it will hopefully keep you from ""settling"" for someone who treats you poorly instead of respects you and your strength. So give it time.

Hospice/palliative care will help him. In there they don't care about his kidney function or if how much he eats, they just care that he's comfortable and not in any pain. There will be no more monitors or tubes, no more constant poking and prodding. The only medication he'll be on is those that help him feel better. It's likely they'll even hook him up to his own morphine pump (there's a limit put on it per hour based on patient weight) and that way he won't have to call a nurse every time he needs another dose.

Something else we found helpful is that in hospice/palliative, the nurses and doctors are also specially trained and their #1 goal is to make sure the patient and their family are comfortable. It's a quieter place, without the tense hustle and bustle of a regular ward floor. When he passes, it will be peaceful. Not for you, that will be painful of course...but he won't be suffering any more. At some time, he will go, a nurse or doctor will confirm it, and give you as much time as you need to say goodbye.

lorabore,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_aeyu3p,1,efkcg9c,"CBD for pain is more effective when it's applied as a salve directly to the painful area as opposed to taking or orally. 

THC will help with pain because of the ""high"" associated with it creating a sense of dissociation from the body. I can appreciate the fear of being high, but it's really not bad at all. An indica strain is going to be the best for sleep (which is the opposite for appetite stimulation where you want a sativa). 

I don't recommend edibles for new people because they can be inconsistent. They are longer to kick in, it's harder to regulate the amount of THC and the high can last a lot longer. For someone afraid of the high, an edible is not the way to start out. A vape oil or sublingual oil would be optimal. A hybrid like AK-47 or bloom will give him a bit of an appetite stim followed by a relaxation and sleep. And if he feels too high and doesn't like it, the give him some pure CBD which will counteract the high feeling. 

As far as opioids...this is what I have to say about that. 

Opioids can create physical dependence in patients without causing addiction and most people who take opioids for short periods will develop some mild dependency. But they will not develop an addiction. The largest issue with opioid pain killers is not the patients who take them, but actual diversion of prescribed meds to family members with a pre-existing addiction or dependence. 

The benefits of treating cancer and treatment related pain are widespread though. Pain prevents physical activity and physical inactivity leads to deconditioning and ultimately more pain. Even a short course of low dose opioid like oxycodone can improve his mobility and physical activity which will then improve his pain longer term. 

There are huge benefits to light range of motion exercises and physical activity like walking in cancer patients. It works palliatively to decrease pain, nausea and vomiting, it improves treatment outcomes, and aids in physical rehab and physical functioning with ADLs. 

But patients don't want to be active or do stretches or physical therapy if they can't get their pain controlled. So it could be worth reconsidering opioids, followed up with a low intensity stretching or ROM program, walking, etc.  

Disclaimer: I am an ACSM certified cancer exercise trainer, currently conducting research on the role of community-based physical exercise programs on increasing physical activity levels in cancer patients and survivors.

KoopaTroopa34,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_amakrp,3,efkoss5,"First, take a minute and relax. It's going to be a bumpy long road. Being pissed off, angry, sad, depressed..... you'll go through them all. But I'm going through this as well. Except my mom had mets to the brain. Here's what I can offer:

1. Find a GOOD oncology team and hospital. We thought of our local docs but my mom's main PCP advised against it. Gave us a choice of 2 university hospitals. Opted for the one in-state only about 60 miles away. Glad we went that route. I'll explain later.

2. Those stats are right. But here's the thing: most are about 5 to 10 years old. Things have changed by leaps and bounds in just 5 years. No longer are most NSCLC an immediate death sentence. I've met more 10 plus year survivors during my mom's treatments than I can count. At least 30 or 40. They live with the disease or it's considered in remission. 

3. Explore every option. Request they test her to see if she's a candidate for immunotherapy (keytruda). If they wont, go elsewhere. DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Look at surgeries, chemo, radiation, whatever if need be and that's what the docs advise. But go for the immunotherapy first if possible.

4. Treat her the same. Everybody did the whole ""I'm sorry"" and crying. On July 4th, I walked in, plopped down in her bed, gave her a plate of hamburgers/hotdogs/etc and a Pepsi, and told her to give me the remote. I treated her not like a cancer patient but my mom. It was a break she needed from everybody. Made things normal for her. I do the same thing now still. 

5. Look at anti-depressants. Trust me on this. Cancer has a way of fucking with your mind. More on this below.

My mom was diagnosed July 2 2018. A 7cm by 4cm mass in her left lung. On July 6, three tumors ranging from a golf ball to an eraser in her brain. Doc #1 said he was optimistic and signed her off to Doc #2 because he's ""THE BEST"". Doc 2 gave her 1 to 3 months with 1 month being his best guess. Her brain surgeon did a bang up job and cleared 1 whole tumor and 99% of the big one. Gamma knife was used for the smallest one and the remaining 1%. He said she should get a second opinion as he reviewed her notes and saw she hadn't even been tested for certain mutations. I pushed Doc #1 for immunotherapy and she failed the first 3 blood tests. On the 4th and final sample, she tested positive. An ideal match the drug company was looking for. Every 3 weeks, she gets a treatment. It puts her down for a day or two but she's right back up after it. She went from sleeping 20 or so hours a day and one tiny meal that she would throw up (right around the first of October) to a normal 8 hours of sleep (with a after lunch nap) and 4 or 5 decent size meals. She's even began gaining her weight back. She cooks her own meals. She cleans the house. She even goes to the grocery store and Walmart. Hell, she cooked  the annual massive Thanksgiving and Christmas Day dinners all by herself. People offered to help but she wanted to do it. Her antidepressant is part responsible for this because she's not as sad and worried about the future. It changed her outlook. 

It's to early but according to the doc, he's confident it's not her time for quite a while.  The original lung mass is about 30% smaller after just 4 treatments and 2 weeks worth of ""spot radiation"". One lymphnode has shrank 1mm to .9cm and another is stable at 1cm. I haven't seen her current scans but she's gotten 2 additional since the scan showed shrinkage. Doc#2 considers immunotherapy a ""waste"" and just palliative care. By going for a 2nd or even 3rd opinion, you might just find something that works.",t3_amakrp,,2019-02-02 05:11:46,/r/cancer/comments/amakrp/stage_4_mets_to_adrenal_gland_only_non_small_cell/efkoss5/,r/cancer,,

I know it might seem like thats the last thing you want to do as it might seem like you are giving up, but no, those programs are there to help everyone.  They can give you a much needed break.

I also recently took care of my wife that had tumor of unknown origin.  There isn't any best way to get through it, you have to find out what works best for you.  

I think for your moms situation, just try and understand what type of breast cancer, what are her markers and start doing research online, or asking here about what has helped other people.  Once you figure out what might work, bring it up to the doctors and don't be passive about it, but be courteous or they wont listen. 

Your BF situation has to get dealt with asap before it goes down the wrong path.  Either he understands and wants to help, or he's ready to move on.

First off - I'm so sorry to hear that you even *have* to make this decision, especially at such a young age. The whole ""quantity vs. quality"" debate is a complicated decision, one for which there is no right answer. 

Therapy and further discussion with your oncologist can help you make a more informed decision, but ultimately the decision is yours, and yours alone. Personally, once I made my decision, I found it somewhat freeing, but that was after long and protracted illness and a grueling treatment regimen.

&gt; this last-ditch chemo option had a less than 10% chance of actually working

Try not to play the numbers game too much. I mean, obviously, you have to factor that into your game plan, along with things like side effects, quality of life, and so on, but the overall numbers don't always translate well to individual cases. Factors like age, overall health, tumor load, etc. all come into play.

It's may be worth getting additional opinions and treatment options - there may be other treatment options, palliative or otherwise. Even if you approach it from the standpoint of gaining a few extra months/years, new treatments or clinical trials may become available.

&gt; But truthfully, the kind of life that a cancer patient lives - going through chemo with limited strength and no hair and a hundred horrible side-effects from treatment - I don't want to live like that.

Can definitely feel you there. After 5 cycles of inpatient treatments, I chose quality over quantity. I mean, I chose the treatment first, but I had to stop eventually.

&gt; I guess, and this is me just being vaguely curious, what would you do if you were in my position? 

Personally? I was well into stage IV (both lungs, liver, bones, and like a bazillion lymph nodes), and did the ""Hail Mary"" treatment with abysmal odds (6% CR rate!) until I couldn't anymore. I nearly died from side effects a few times, and the tumors weren't resolving, so I stopped treatments and started making arrangements. 

3 months after I made my decision, my PETs were clear. They asked me to do 2 more cycles afterwards, but I just couldn't justify going through it, so I accepted the inevitable, having been satisfied that I at least tried. That was in 2012, March 17th will be my 7th year NED.

I don't want to imply that everything will be OK, or that you should put yourself through hell and back, or that you can just be chipper and everything will be alright, because it just... sucks. Cancer sucks. It's a stupid, shitty disease that doesn't discriminate or take prisoners, and even if you come out alive on the other end, it's not without great personal cost (health, employment, relationships, financial security - you name it). But I'd also hate for you to take the L before you've even really started.

**Things you can do in the meantime:** 

* Rally the troops for support
* Get in touch with a therapist
* Work closely with your oncologist(s) 
* Treat yourself, do things you like
* Find/plan something to look forward to, even if it's short term planning

Get all of your options on the table. Really make sure you're in a good headspace before making your decision. 

After that... all you can really do is let medical science (or nature) run its course. Whatever your decision, you can at least take solace in the fact that you did everything you could - even if you decide against treatment. You know your strengths and limits better than anyone!

And so sorry to hear you're in this predicament in the first place :/ Above all, just do what's right for you. And I mean that. Not for anyone else, not family, friends, partners - just you.

FrauKoko,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_apat9v,3,egac0ac,"This is such a shitty situation to be in. You've got a lot of good advice here. But no matter what choice you make, it's yours to make, yours to regret, yours to be a peace with. Do what you're most comfortable with. Make the decision while you can so that way someone else isn't forced to choose on your behalf. Like you said there is no right or wrong answer. 

My only recommendation in figuring out what you're going to be most at peace with:

- get a second opinion or assess die clinical trials 
- ask your oncologist if you could chat to another patient who had to make the same decision between the same super awful 10% chemo or palliative. Getting perspective from someone who has gone through it may help you find your path
- if you decide to go with chemo ask your oncologist and palliative docs how they plan to handle the side effects. If they don't have a lot of options to control side effects, then it may not be worth it. But also ask how quickly the horrible side effects subside if you were to start chemo but decide to quit if your quality of life declines. Because if the side effects typically linger for a very long time, it may not be worth it. Some chemo sucks for months after while some is cumulative while others may have a shorter duration of feeling shitty. If you know what the rebound time is you might be more or less willing to give it a go. 
- You can always stop treatment but you can't get treatment when you're dead. It's a gamble either way. What if you play and it gives you a lot more time? What if you play and your remaining time is shitty and short? What if it's in between?

It basically comes down to how much you're willing to endure at a chance to get a bit more time. Some people it's quality of life, some it's quantity, and for others they have to die knowing they tried everything. It's a ridiculous thing to face at your age. :(",t3_apat9v,,2019-02-12 05:04:31,/r/cancer/comments/apat9v/difficult_situation_would_appreciate_help_from/egac0ac/,r/cancer,,

EUBanana,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_awbj74,3,ehqkumr,"Diagnosed in September with stage 4 RCC - left kidney and a brain metastasis.  It was the brain met that was symptomatic, I had aphasia which progressed to a headache which I swear would've killed me if I wasn't in hospital at the time being observed.  They put me on steroids (dexamethasone) which controlled the headache, I'm still on them now.   The kidney tumour was huge (9cm...) but no symptoms at all.

At first they didn't want to do anything other than palliative treatment, but after scanning everything the brain met turned out to be the only metastasis, which is apparently rare for stage 4 so they figured it was worth aggressive treatment.  Gamma ray knife radiosurgery on the brain met in October and a radical nephrectomy for the kidney.in January - that was delayed because in December I caught pneumonia due to the steroids suppressing my immune system - ended up in ICU and everything - and general anaesthesia after having pneumonia is a no no apparently.  Actually it being pneumonia was a relief, they thought the cancer had spread to the lungs at first, but a rescan showed it hadn't changed at all.

The nephrectomy was a bit fraught, they were saying they'd maybe take a bit of bowel, a bit of lymph node, depending on where it was.  Turned out the cancer hadn't spread beyond the kidney 'bag' so at the last minute it was done laparascopically and not particularly 'radically'.  (as the surgeon said, the cancer was safely in a bag in a bag - the bag of the kidney, and the plastic bag they put the kidney in while it's still in your body when they do this thing keyhole).  The surgeon is of the opinion that my immune system is fighting it, kidney cancer being one of the few cancers where that occasionally happens.  Which would explain the brain met, as the brain doesn't really have an immune system thanks to the blood brain barrier.  

Had a followup MRI on the brain a couple of weeks ago, don't have the results yet.  I've been told that in the medium term the radiosurgery might make it worse, because it irritates the tumour before it renders it inert and my headaches are getting worse again.  But my dose of dexamethasone came down from 12mg to 2mg so it's clearly helped.  Got a body CT scan in summer to see if anything pops up elsewhere too.  They said there's no benefit to pre-emptive immunotherapy so they are hanging fire on that until something new appears.  

Right now sort of in a holding pattern, waiting on scan results, and for the situation to change.  Brain met under control, kidney gone.  just depends when and where the next met turns up.

Oh and to add insult to injury - I sprained my knee on New Years walking to the pub.  :)  Badly.  It's only just recovered, though as I was barely mobile anyway for a few weeks after the surgery I got plenty of rest for it anyway...

I've told pretty much everybody, and all my friends have been very nice.  They didn't know what to do at first, and obviously each dealt with it in their own way, but as my symptoms are mild it's more a theoretical thing at the moment, they don't know I'm quite possibly dying just by talking to me.  :)  So.

Ragnar234,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ay6kpj,2,ehzt0h6,"No one knows what time patients have left. The chemo will probably help him extend life and be palliative. New chemo drugs are less harsh as well. Try not to get hung up on prognosis and time left. I know of patients that were told they were terminal a few years ago or at least have lived far longer than the prognosis the oncologist has given. In the end, could be said that we are all terminal. Some of us know what is going to get us - that's the main difference. None of us know how much time any of us have left it's just that we don't expect to die any time soon. All you can do is be strong and be there for your parents which you are doing. I am in this situation also with my dad who was diagnosed in January with incurable mesothelioma. Every day has been like a bad dream and the only relief if I am honest has been sleep. When the alarm goes off, cancer is back. Our oncologist has taken brutal honesty to a new level to the point where my dad doesn't want to see her. There are however new treatments. Positivity is so important because they can and do often get it wrong in terms of how long someone has. Are there any clinical trials available that can get access to immunotherapy? There are new treatments out there mostly accessible by clinical trials. Cancer Research usually has a list of them on its website for each type of cancer. Some are for stage 3 others are for stage 4. Some are randomised others are not. There is a company in Cambridge called Oncologica that does DNA sampling of biopsy samples. These tests look at the genetic mutations in your Dads tumour to identify the best targeted therapies. In some cases there aren't any licensed drugs but they can give you the most appropriate trials to try and get on.

I worked on a palliative care team for the past year, so I had a good idea of what was going on and was able to prepare myself as much as possible.

Glioblastoma is unfortunately a poor prognosis, even for patients who are fairly healthy to begin with. Primary treatment is surgery followed by radiation and a chemo pill. On average about 50% of patients survive about 10 months if they undergo all of those treatments. I'm sorry to say that in your grandfather's case it is likely a fraction of that time. 

If he is unable to do the surgery, radiation and chemotherapy could potentially be an option. Do note that this is not curative, but instead to improve symptoms temporarily and attempt to extend life. He however needs be reassessed by cancer doctors because the treatment itself could cause more harm than benefits.

Otherwise controlling his symptoms with steroids such as dexamethasone, and seeing a palliative care physician or a hospice service like previously mentioned is an appropriate choice.

FrauKoko,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_az8bwu,3,ei90k0t,"Unfortunately given his age, frailty, inoperable status, and GBM diagnosis his prognosis is very poor. GBMs are fatal, how long it takes depends on a variety of factors. Age - typically younger folks have a little better prognosis as they are usually healthier, have fewer health problems, can tolerate treatment better etc. Surgical resection - the more tumor removed the better. Genetic mutations such as IDH mutant typically responds better to treatment compared to IDH wild type. Current functional status - the more deconditioned, frail, or already severely disabled tend to have poorer outcomes compared to people who are active, care for themselves, work etc. 

If he is eligible for treatment (chemo and radiation) and wants to do it, then it depends on how well he can tolerate treatment and if he responds to treatment. Some folks tolerate treatment okay but the tumor may or may not respond to treatment. Other folks do not tolerate it and decline quickly. 

I'd really have a frank discussion with his neuro oncologist and him to see what his prognosis is, if they think he could even handle it, and if he really wants to do it. I will say that treatment is a very busy time - just a lot of moving parts. 

Whether or not he decides to do treatment, I would make sure you get palliative care involved early. Palliative care can happen if he is undergoing treatment. They are outstanding at managing symptoms. But when it's time for hospice, it's a smooth transition. Hospice generally enters when you've stopped treatment and just want to focus on quality of remaining life.

I would also ask his neuro oncologist to get you in touch with their social worker and case manager. They have a lot of resources to help him and the caregiver. Some of them take a little time to get set up with, so the sooner you can get them to work on those resources the quicker they will be available.

Is your mom the caregiver for both your dad and your grandpa? If so, your dad can ask his oncologist for their social worker too. You'll need to get help where ever you can. Yard work, grocery store, errands, transportation, someone to go to appointments, house work, etc.

You both need to take care of yourself. You can't be a good caregiver if you're not caring for yourself. I'd be a hot mess without my self care. You guys have a lot going on so it will be important.

I made a appointment with them to help deal with my cancer symptoms and the side effects of treatment.

These are clinicians who only manage symptoms. They work with the oncologists typically so the therapies should not screw each other up. We ask the descriptive pain questions (burning, shooting, aching) because they indicate different kinds of pain that are managed in different ways. Narcotics aren't going to be nearly as effective at nerve pain as something like gabapentin, and if it's aching muscle pain I'd typically try to get an order for an NSAID or something like that.

Since your pain is over night and not during typical middle of the day appointment times, KEEP A JOURNAL! Set a notepad by your bed if the pain is waking you up and document a date and time and a few quick words on your pain. We love a 1-10 rating, and a few descriptive words and if it's keeping you up all night. That way you have something to bring in and show your practitioner exactly what's happening.

It is given to alleviate symptoms, such as pain or the fluid buildup you mention. It is designed to make the person more comfortable.

LominAle,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_bbt7ip,2,ekm3ujk,"If this is already a very short life expectancy, then the important things to weigh are what the chemo and radiation are expected to provide; they may prolong life (and getting an idea about how many more days/weeks/month extra they may get by undergoing treatment would be important) or they may be palliative (improve how she feels, without changing life expectancy) or both. From there, it would be valuable to help your friend evaluate what’s important to them, whether it’s most important to extend life as long as possible, or whether it’s more important to avoid pain/nausea/discomfort, or some middle ground. Depending on the cancer and the treatments available, these different values may or may not be mutually exclusive. If comfort is most important, discussing with the oncologist when entering hospice (a type of care focused on maximizing comfort in patients who are no longer pursuing life-prolonging therapy) would be appropriate. Regardless of whether they will go on hospice in the near term, having a palliative care specialist involved early/now is a good idea; palliative care may sound like hospice, but is a separate field involved in a range of pain control, emotional support, goals of care planning and support on a whole range of other issues that come up when one is diagnosed with a terminal or chronic disease BUT is not limited by life expectancy or treatment plans (i.e. getting palliative care involved is not affected by whether one is stopping other treatments).",t3_bbt7ip,,2019-04-11 08:03:09,/r/cancer/comments/bbt7ip/what_do_i_need_to_know_ask_research_about_this/ekm3ujk/,r/cancer,,

hcardo,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_bihthk,5,em1nr4v,"Dear RedditAussie, 

I’m sitting here alone with my wife in a hospital room that works as a sort of a hospice for her and I wanted to share some lessons we’ve just learned:

//
 1) You just need be there for here and don’t be afraid to ask her relatives for help for you and the kids.  

2) There are things you won’t be able to control so you should focus on those you can control starting with yourself. Be stoic:

- Live one day at a time and spare a few time for you to recharge. You need to get temperance for her. 

- Start living healthy ( scheduled  routines, food, drink, mindfulness) and Be moderate going forward.

- Learn about cancer caring as much as possible

- IMPORTANT: Your wife will get a lot of benefit if she chooses to fight. Become her coach.

//
3.- Disclose the situation at work so you could work from home or get extra leave days from collegues, negotiate a period of time with less salary and handover partially your duties to someone else from your team.  

- Also let HR know that you’re seeking for counseling. They might know how to help you at the beginning.

- The company you are working for, should acknowledge and be flexible with you ethically-wise. Keep a file of your case and communications if possible just in case you need it and stay legit on your duties. 

//
4. - Try to get psychiatric, psychological help upfront to start dealingwith your own issues and feelings such as anger, grieving, sleeping problems or depression. 

//
5.- Control your insurance expenditures and budget. 

 -For every in-out/patient treatment you can ask for a rationale. 

-Ask the hospital and the insurance for expense reports

-Understand and clarification on details about your policy, e.g: critical illness, nurse caring at home, ambulance

//
6. - Learn as much as possible about the disease itself and track its progression/remission:

- Learn about the disease, symptoms according to the stage she got and chemo related side effects depending on the chosing protocol

- Assess and relate the real progression of the disease. Log the treatment received to her body vitals such as pain, weight, nausea, and prescribed medicines and dose taken: you need two logs to keep records of what she’s getting.

- Share your charts and assumptions  with the doctors to validate the effectiveness of each chemo cycle. Keep asking questions (again)

- IMPORTANT: Ask your oncologist about a getting a gene profile as soon as possible and start with combined chemotherapy.

//
7.- Put pressure on your oncologist on how he intends to:

 - Manage changes issues such as pain, body wasting, CINV (nausea, vomiting) and bowel (constipation-diarrhea) syndroms if they’re not controlled short-term: Time if of the essence.

- Coordinate treatments and caring with other doctors and specialists. He should act more like an hospitalist MD and a manager and not imposing on you more work. 

- consider Palliative care should not be considered only when the patient became terminal. 

- Consider a second opinion from another oncologist. It is your right. 

- Check his soft-skills as well. You need also from him to manage the case as a whole. Set high expectations: Character flaws such as a huge ego, lack of focus and not briefing you properly or poorly about the treatment and options are a bad sign ahead yet he might be good at his work ( applying the right chemo formula)

//
8. - If she needs to be hospitalized, check for nursing expertise with cancer patients and engage upfront with a patient relationship officer. Some staff might be illiterate less to say, when dealing with chemo ports, hydration, pain asessment, etc..,

//
9.- If you need to communicate bad/good news:

- ask someone of her family to act on your behalf as much as possible. Same for friends, your family.  You don’t need to deal with everyone of your circle. 

- They don’t need to know all details. Just give the right amount of information to the relevant people on time.

//
10.- recall all sorts of memories and create more moments to strenghten even more your marriage bonds.  You’re soulmates now and forever.


These items are crucial in my opinion. I’m also with you and your family even I don’t know you. 

Yours,

After the cancer grows then he will have folfiri and a few other options. In my mind he just started his fight. Who knows what chemo will work best for him and knock his cancer back.

If I were in your shoes I would ask for palliative care doctor and get him on stronger pain meds. If the family meeting turns out to be a hospice suggestion and no one is ready say no you want to fight this and then find a new hospital or a new doctor. Go to the biggest, beat hospital you can get to. Preferably a NCI hospital.

I noticed you said you didn’t want to give up yet. However painful this may read, this isn’t your decision to make. It is your dad who is having to deal with the symptoms, 24/7. I have seen many families fight and have falling outs due to differences in opinion over another family member’s care. Please do not try to sway your dad in his decision making, that is his choice, and it may come down to quality of life. 

**IF** the subject of palliative care/does come up, do not think of it like the end. This type of medical care switches to preservation of dignity &amp; making the patient completely comfortable (instead of implementing interventions/medication that would prolong life)

The ob/gyn kept treating me for PID due to my age (36) (despite not having PID symptoms). Eventually, I went to the ER because I couldn't take the pain anymore. Diagnosis: stage 4b ovarian cancer. Within a week I was dying of respiratory failure due to ascites. I was given 2 weeks without treatment or 4-6 months with treatment. They suggested palliative care vs hospice. 

I chose treatment. Aggressive treatment. I'm 2 years out from diagnosis now. It hasn't been easy. I have a PE, a DVT in my gonadal vein, three lung surgeries (i'm missing one full lobe and a piece or two of each remaining lobe), one really big abdominal surgery (good bye uterus, ovaries, lymph nodes, omentum, cervix, and upper half of my vagina), a small heart attack, liver injury, three anaphylactic reactions, a GI bleed, two colonoscopies, 29 chemos (and counting), and countless procedures and scans.

Female cancers are incredibly difficult to diagnose. Unfortunately, all of the symptoms can be written off as something benign and simple. I understand the frustration and anger you feel.

I am actually well known among my supervisors and peers for being very skilled at delivering bad news, like a cancer diagnosis, and for having realistic discussions about goals of care and level of intervention. Funny enough, those skills don’t translate well into one’s personal life - I recently gave my sister the news, and despite thinking about the order in which I wanted to present things in my head beforehand I completely deviated and doubt I made any sense at all.

I think a big part of the problem is that neuroendocrine tumours are rare and don’t act like normal tumours. People keep asking me where the tumour is and how big it is, and I have to explain that we can’t find it right now, and that even though it’s microscopic it’s wreaking havoc by producing too many hormones, rather than growing until it takes over the function of another tissue. It’s also hard to explain why we can’t just use traditional chemotherapy to treat it, and why it’s so important to treat the symptoms as best as we can until a tumour DOES pop up, and even then we have to hope its the primary and not a metastasis. And that it can take years before anything is visible on a scan. 

I’m really glad to hear your husband’s doctors are treating you with value and respect, as they should! A patient’s family is an extremely important part of the care team, and any good care team recognizes that. My doctors have been similarly good about letting me be involved; rather than having a separate internist coordinate my care between physicians, I have been doing most it on my own (while in constant contact with everyone), and I am able to check my blood tests remotely so that I can titrate my medications as needed and without needed to wait for someone else’s phone call or email.

mariekeap,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_brpzu8,1,eoj6id4,"Hey F,

First of all I'm so sorry that you and your father are having to go through this. My partner's father (not married but I'll just refer to him as father-in-law or FIL) passed away recently from advanced prostate cancer. I know that might not sound comforting...it's not...but we did learn that he survived 5 years with it, so that is something.

He didn't share anything with his children, other family or friends other than his wife until shortly before he passed so everything we know now is either based on observation or things that we learned after. 

FIL was diagnosed around 50 and he was already stage IV - similar to your dad, it was in his bones by that point. The hormone therapy helped keep it at bay for 2.5 years! In that time his quality of life was good - he traveled, played sports...we didn't even know he was ill at the time. I don't know the specifics of his PSA but yes, it did go down during this time. 

Unfortunately, the PSA started to go up again so he moved to radiation (note - in stage IV surgery is no longer an option) therapy. This helped some, but it did make him very tired and caused lymphedema in his legs. This was the hardest side effect by far because it lasted until the end - he couldn't walk properly due to the swelling. Note that this is not a guaranteed side effect but it's something to be aware of. 

After the radiation, they decided to add in chemo but abandoned it rather quickly as it didn't have much effect. I cannot confirm but by then there were many more mets, I know in the liver and lungs for sure. He was much more tired and in more pain by this point. 

A little over a year before he passed he tried immunotherapy in clinical trials, but that was not successful in his case. He then flew overseas for a new radioligand treatment offered in Germany and I think the USA now. Sadly, it did not have any effect for him but it has had good successes in other Stage IV patients, so this may be something for your dad to look into as well depending on his financial situation and interest in fighting it off.

FIL fought it tooth and nail until just a few days before he passed when it was finally accepted that it was time to let go and move to palliative. He wasn't in any more pain then - palliative doctors and nurses are wonderful people.

I don't know if this answers anything or helps at all. It's still fresh, still painful. That said, the doctors apparently originally told his wife it would likely only be 1-2 years, so we got double that and are so grateful. Make the most of all the time you have and try to take it one step at a time - there is hope yet.",t3_brpzu8,,2019-05-23 17:48:33,/r/cancer/comments/brpzu8/dads_just_been_diagnosed_with_advanced_prostate/eoj6id4/,r/cancer,,

Palliative care is an excellent resource as they are the experts in managing symptoms and side effects. When the time comes for hospice, they too are exceptionally skilled at making us comfortable.

More to the point of your question, being put on oxygen is likely if your oxygen saturation drops, and there are ways your doctors can help control your cough. As for concerns around pain or feeling like suffocating, thankfully opioids actually address both. Drugs like morphine act on pathways in the brain that register shortness of breath, so even though the  body may be experiencing that lack of oxygen, you yourself should be comfortable if your team manages things correctly.

That will show trials world wide. You can narrow to type, stage, locations.

I'm in that gray area of ""no viable treatment"" but I said puck it, I'm going to enjoy life. I've learned to run. I've  leaned to Swim. I've done sprint triathlons. None of my doctors that was was possible, yet I'm doing it.  One of my docs started to caution me about not over doing it, but then caught himself and just said to go for it. Worst case it ruptures a blood vessel in my lung, but screw it I've got to keep moving.

NSCLC-Adenocarcinona. My Sub-type being non responsive for chemo, immunotherapy, additional surgeries not viable. Radiation to control tumor size.

I did start coughing during a swim (slug of water) but roll over onto my back and keep going, looking like a whale blowing water! I don't care about how fast I do the swim, but for me it is just doing it.

Swimming induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) hurts like a mofo, but it is funny to explain to the doc ""swallowed too much lake water"" during a swim. Thankfully my Pulmonologist is old school and we both understand neither of us understand why I keep going.

So key is doing what you enjoy. I still have to be fiscally responsible for my wife/dogs. Kids are adults are on their own. Trust fund to pay for my dogs to have a good life (i.e. something happens to me and my wife, house is paid for, kid(s) can live there and take care of the dogs; after the dogs live out their lives funds dispersed to Micheal Fox Foundation; Golden Retriever Rescue; Kids).

There will be a day I need to look at Palliative Care, but till then there is still a lot of life yet to live. Hospice is about ""management"" so should be considered for long term issues. Social, Medical, Nursing. There are some fantastic folks in there.

First, I am so incredibly sorry you guys got this news. Metastatic cancer is a piece of shit (my mom is dealing with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer). Cancer survivors beat their life expectancy timetables more often than you would realize, and some even go into remission. Metastatic cancer is no joke, but it *can* be beaten. Talk privately to his oncologist and ask him/her about your dad's chances, assuming that every step is taken.

So the first thing that you should expect is that every case is different. What happens next is largely based on whether or not his oncologist thinks that he can possibly be cured of the cancer or at least bring the size of the tumours to a more manageable level so as to be rendered in remission. If he can, then they'll proceed with any manner of treatment, whether it be radiation, chemotherapy, or any of the new treatments that come out year by year. With any luck, he'll beat this.

Now, if the oncologist has determined that remission is not possible, then he has the option to take any possible treatments to increase his life expectancy as much as possible. This is largely meant to be palliative, but can increase survival expectancy by a good amount.

In any case, his next step will most likely be some sort of cancer treatment for one objective or another. What I would advise for you is to speak, one on one, with his oncologist (away from your father, as - speaking from experience of coming from a family of them - doctors tend to be much more frank when they aren't in front of the person they're treating).

No matter what happens, you guys are both in my thoughts. Make sure he gives that cancer holy hell. ❤️",t3_buarxl,,2019-05-29 07:51:09,/r/cancer/comments/buarxl/what_should_i_expect/ep9u3yl/,r/cancer,,

When my husband was diagnosed I had already learned lessons from my experience with my father. I made a FB page to update friends and family and explained that it was too difficult to repeat over and over how he found out, why he went to get checked and what the diagnosis/prognosis was. It’s a shock that hits your very soul so I didn’t want him to relive it every time he had to tell the story. I also requested a schedule for phone calls because we’re so busy all day and we need down time to ourselves. I warned them that he wanted to hear about their lives too lol! We didn’t want his entire life consumed by cancer. People were very understanding when they understood we aren’t rejecting them, we love them and appreciate their support and this is how they can support us. We asked all of his coworkers to get scopes done in honour of him because EC is often diagnosed too late. So many of them booked them immediately, it really made my husband happy but sadly two did find cancers they were unaware of, luckily it may not be too late for them.

jsookun,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_bwhlsn,2,epxnw0l,"My father had pancreatic cancer also.. so I am telling you from my father's perspective... the best recourse would be to remove the tumour by surgery.

You need to know if the tumour is at the head or tail of the pancreas. Usually if it is at the head of the pancreas, as the tumour grows in size, it will press against your intestinal organs (malignant bowel obstruction) and eating food will become very difficult.

If the tumour is not removed by surgery, you need to consult the oncologist on what the best recourse is. I reckon usually it's chemotherapy and or radiation depending on the progression of the cancer and the severiry of the disease.

The cancer sufferor is bound to lose a lot of weight and become frail. 

If the pancreatic cancer is due to diabetes as is usually the case, the patient is bound to suffer increased levels of blood glucose which is likely to bring its own share of inconvenients.

So as you can see with cancer, the whole body is in a deteriorating state of flux including the mental health.

Given the age of the patient, tough decisions need to be made about the course of treatment like chemotherapy/radiation.

If all of the above treatment options fail due to the advanced and late stage of the disease, palliative care remains and the final stages of pancreatic cancer are usually painful and very strong pain relievers like morphine need to be administered like for my father's case.

I hope you find the information above helpful but please be reminded that each case of pancreatic cancer poses unique situations and only a medically trained staff can provide you the best answer.

In terms of radiation, most people have answered your questions:

1. No, you won't be radioactive, although that'd be cool.
2. Sessions last on average about 10-15 minutes, with the average radiation 'on' time being about 5 minutes.
3. Immediately immediately? Nothing. However, with spine radiation, there will be a flare up of pain because the radiation is causing some inflammation. Often the doctor will give you medication to take before treatment for that.
4. Most of the time, the pain flare is the only thing you really have to worry about. I wouldn't worry about skin changes for most palliative patients because it's really the least of their worries.

They will probably have you on a pain pump which will take care of most of the sharpest pain. You’ll still be sore but it should be dealable. 

The nurse should check on you frequently and make sure you are okay. You will possibly have phantom pains which are hard to describe even while I’m having them. 

You will sleep a lot the first couple days and think it won’t get better.....but it will. They will have you up as soon as physically able to practice transfers and I would imagine fit you for a prosthetic. 

I don’t know much about osteosarcoma. I don’t feel like I added much, I learned to cope and healed from an amputation of my entire left side to the hip. You can/will too.

It’s a real joy killer when you’re trying to get some respite from the day to day reality of cancer.

Supplements can add up. Find out where they go and purchase a gift card for them.

Pet sitting! If they have pets. My poor little dog is left alone far too often for far too long 😞.  Knowing their pet is taken care of is a relief.

If they have children, offer to take them somewhere fun with your family. This is hard on them too. Kids need to be kids. I’m sure like everyone, they’ll find ourselves with no time and no funds left.

Give the adults a break from each other! Maybe a friend can offer to drive the patient to that CT scan or chemo etc so the other can get things done that have been neglected or simply sleep without one ear open.

A good size cooler bag, for carrying medications/lunch to appointments. 

A good system/brief for keeping notes/appointments/instructions they can take to appointments. There is a LOT of waiting in waiting rooms. 

Does anyone have a cottage? Maybe offer them a weekend away.

Take them to dinner/bbq. 

I think while they’re well enough, getting out with friends as much as possible is great, doing things you’ve always enjoyed.

If they’re too sick, it’s more difficult. Make sure the patient and caregiver can handle a visit. Sometimes it can be difficult, especially while in palliative care. A lot of patient needs must be met and there will be visits from healthcare professionals and personal support workers. The caregiver can become overwhelmed with too many distractions and obligations.
When you visit bring a freezable meal for the caregiver. Bring snacks for other guests, the caregiver is lucky to get a pee break, they don’t often have time to shop or take care of their own needs. 
Offering to sit with the patient so they can catch up on some desperately needed sleep will be incredibly appreciated. Caregiving is exhausting.

Hope this helped a little.",t3_c22u3s,,2019-06-18 17:44:19,/r/cancer/comments/c22u3s/care_package/erhp4zn/,r/cancer,,

MehraMilo,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_c8jd6b,1,eso8cul,"Hey, OP. I'm so sorry your mom's going through this. My mom had extensive bone mets from breast cancer and the pain was horrendous until we figured out a plan that worked for her. She wasn't pain-free after that, but it was more a 2/10 rather than 10/10 or 11/10.

I'll tell you what we did, but I will add the caution that everyone reacts to pain meds differently, and what worked for my mom may not work for yours. But it may be worth asking your doctors about if they haven't pursued it already.

In my mom's case, morphine never worked for her in the past so we never tried it. Fentanyl gave her wicked side effects including nausea and visual hallucinations. What *did* work was, believe it or not, methadone. She had a low ""maintenance"" dose of methadone three times per day, and then dilaudid as-needed for breakthrough/extreme pain. We also had a topical gel (Voltaren) for sore spots along her ribs, but we used that pretty rarely. 

IIRC the dilaudid could make her space-y and sleepy, but I don't remember any side effects from the methadone.

TL;DR: ask your doc about methadone and dilaudid.

It may be hard to get prescribed, especially if you're not in an in-patient hospital setting, so I don't want to get your hopes up. But it's worth a try. 

I might also ask your doctor about something like an ""advanced illness management"" team, or something with a similar name...a group of docs who probably work out of a local hospital or cancer center (the ones we dealt with were attached to the area hospital), and who specialize in advanced diseases like stage IV cancer, palliative care, etc. They're the ones who got my mom's pain management sorted out so well. If you have a group like that in your area and you've not met with them already, I'd highly recommend it.",t3_c8jd6b,,2019-07-03 13:55:22,/r/cancer/comments/c8jd6b/pain_relief_for_breast_cancer_mets_to_bone/eso8cul/,r/cancer,,

-try as hard as you can to get some meals in your freezer, fill your cupboards with as many one-handed snacks as you possibly can (the other arm will be holding the baby!), and if you have any family or close friends near you, ask for as much help as you possibly can. Chemo is exhausting, newborns are exhausting. Both at once? Ask for help, again and again. 

-Mental health is so important to you and your wife right now. I have no idea what services are available where you live but we had consults from Cancer Society NZ and the hospital palliative care team to make sure we knew what was out there for us. Use them! Post partum, your wife is going to have a major hormonal swing and you will need to watch for PPD too.

-this is really hard to write, I don’t want to make your stress and anxiety worse, but this is a serious diagnosis with a serious risk that you may not see your baby grow old. Think about what you would like him or her to know about you, what things you’ve done in your life that you’re proud of, places you’ve been, fun adventures you had as a child, and record them in some way. Write in a journal, video, find photos from friends and family to use as prompts for your memories. 

-further to that, when your baby is born, take as many photos and videos with you interacting as you possibly can. You will not regret it. 

-totally agree with the comment about eating as best you can, plus trying to exercise, drink lots of water, etc. You need to be in good shape for chemo to knock you around. Get some sun on your face while walking your newborn, things like that.

That is something that shouldn’t be underestimated.

Depression sucks. A lot. As a caretaker for people with mental illnesses I see that a lot. 
One of the first things I had to learn was that *you can’t help people who refuse help.* 
Even if you could’ve made him see a professional it wouldn’t have worked out. It would’ve probably only worsened your relationship with him.  
And, as important as proper medication is for most mental illnesses, they put a huge strain on people‘s bodies. :/ 

You know what took me a long time to really understand? Sometimes, death really is better.
Around February 2017 my dad had some type of autoimmune meningitis, which (most of the time) is triggered by the immune system going haywire because of a tumor somewhere in the body. There were a lot of tests, but the doctors couldn’t find anything. Very rarely, they said, this kind of meningitis appears as a symptom *before* the tumor. 
So they sent him home, saying he should come back in three months for another screening.
In April this huge bump on the side of his throat appeared. We begged him to get it checked out, but he decided to wait until his appointment in May.
I was with him when he got the diagnosis.

Small cell lung carcinoma. Already metastasized into his lymph nodes all over his body and his liver, with a high chance of the tumor in his throat suffocating him at some point in the near future.
That was the worst day of my life by the way. It was even worse than the day of his death. Or the day of his funeral. I had a complete mental breakdown, my dad was the one to comfort me. That was the kind of person he was.
He started a very aggressive chemo. It was fucking awful. But he pulled through. The tumors shrunk.

On my 28. birthday, Oct 25th 2017, while I was on vacation in Ireland, doctors told my parents that the chemo didn’t work. The tumors were growing again. We changed hospitals. They tried another chemo. At this point we hoped, we begged, for maybe another five years with him. 
Shortly before Christmas that year we learned that this one failed too.  They gave him maybe half a year, but only with yet another chemotherapy, this time lasting until the very end.

That was the turning point for him, I think. He gave up. Christmas came and went, he barely talked to us. Laughed even less. He didn’t want to continue treatment, but we begged. We cried. So he continued. 

He started getting troubles with walking until he barely could move around without a wheelchair. He was getting frustrated. He lashed out on my mom, on us, because he couldn’t stand being so helpless I guess. We got him into methadone treatment.

Around his last birthday, February 21 2018, he started to behave strangely. He tried to get up in the middle of the night to go to work, even though he didn’t work for over a year. Even though he could barely stand on his own. 
They did another test and found two metastases in his brain. He got radiation therapy. They said it helped, but he still behaved erratically.

At this point he needed help with almost everything. He couldn’t even use the bathroom on his own. At the end of April he had his first pneumonia. He was home for maybe two weeks, before he had to go to the hospital again. This time they told my mom to stay with him. They told us the pneumonia is back, but now they also talked about a sepsis. He needed oxygen, even though he barely moved without his wheelchair.
They removed the port, which was reason for the bacteria killing my dad. They tried to evaluate the growth of the main tumor in his lungs, but they couldn’t see anything because they were full of liquid. They tried to give him some hardcore antibiotics, but it was too late.

He was transferred to the palliative care wing. The last time I really spoke to him was the day before he died. I got him ice cream. I told him I love him, all he said was „yeah“. They told us he was stable for now. We went home.
The next day my sister called me. My dad was actively dying, his kidneys weren’t working any longer.
We drove to the hospital, got stuck in traffic.  My brother arrived way earlier, we learned later my dad said something awful to him and my mom. To this day nobody wants to tell me what he said.

We arrived at around 10:00 am, my Dad was barely conscious, except for short bursts of sheer panic during which he tried to get up. He was getting morphine and something against the fear (Tavor?) at this point.
At 1:05pm, on May 9th 2018, my Dad, my hero, my role model, finally died, and a part of me died with him. He was 63. But looking back his spirit, his soul, died shortly before Christmas. Everything else was just suffering.

There are so many things he will never get to see. My brother’s 40th birthday two weeks later.
He wasn’t there when I finally got my driving license one month later. He couldn’t help me choosing my first my car three months later. He wasn’t there for the birth of my niece 7 months later.

I‘m moving next month, and it breaks my heart because he will never see my beautiful new apartment. I‘m packing my stuff and I cry a lot because of all the memories with him.
He will never meet the love of my life that I will hopefully find some day.
I won’t get married because he won’t be there to walk me to the altar. 

Yet still my biggest regret, that I will carry with me until the day I‘ll die, is that we didn’t let him go shortly before Christmas.",t3_c9mdi8,,2019-07-07 00:30:37,/r/cancer/comments/c9mdi8/my_dad_passed_away_from_lung_cancer/et4x9nc/,r/cancer,,

theRacistEuphemism,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_cbvz5q,2,etipwn7,"r/AskDocs is a more active sub with physicians.

If they've declined treatment, bowel cancers tend to be detected because of blockages, so my first thought is discomfort and difficulty with regard to elimination, maybe bleeding. Stool softeners and diet changes can help with that to some degree. It's hard to know when and where it will spread or how fast, but I believe the lung and liver are common places for spread. Bowel cancer may not spread as quickly as some other cancers, so I don't know if asking what their death will be like is something we can answer. Generally speaking, stage two is an optimistic enough time to seek treatment so I'm not sure how many cases there will be of people opting out of treatment. 

If they have opted for this route, have they discussed palliative care? That way, they know to watch over and manage symptoms as they come, and according to their wishes.",t3_cbvz5q,,2019-07-11 14:58:58,/r/cancer/comments/cbvz5q/bowel_cancer_from_start_to_finish_what_to_expect/etipwn7/,r/cancer,,

Mayo Clinic considers him theoretically curable with just one spot of mets in one lung if he manages three successful surgeries (two to spine, one to lung which may need to be removed due to tumor placement). But there is a high risk of recurrence. My husband has had pretty much every type of negative side effect of each treatment so far (with continued worsening neuropathy), so he has convinced himself it isn’t worth it... he’d rather try to enjoy as many ‘good’ days as possible without further painful treatment that will/may worsen his condition.

He was stage IV sarcoma at diagnosis (and still), which alone doesn’t have great odds, but again his only mets is to one spot in one lung, which makes it the most favorable type of stage IV sarcoma.

He knows he could be cured and he says this is the most scary thing. He does not want to live 20-30 years like this. Says he hopes it’s definitely less than two years. Would love to say he’d live for the kids until they’re at least 18, but he can’t and won’t. Says it kills him to hop on social medial and see so many ‘normal’ people hiking, running, going on vacation, etc when he knows he’ll never be able to ever again. When I bring up we can still have fun with him and do stuff, he got angry and said he doesn’t want adapted fun. 

Of course I beat myself up... I’m just one person - only driver now. I’m tired, but I do what I can. Should I have just stayed home more?

albertcamusjr,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_euzzznu,1,ev1tt76,"My context is entirely in the US health system and even though I grew up in a neighborhood called ""Little Bohemia"" with neighbors who spoke Czech, I don't know much about medicine in the Czech Republic.

In the United States we, as physicians, would find it unethical to not inform a mentally intact person of their worsening health. It would be the doctor's responsibility to tell him; it shouldn't be up to you and your family to tell your uncle of his fate.

It is my opinion that it is in your uncle's best interest to be aware of his worsening health, his inability to receive further therapy, and his likely soon death. He has no choice in whether or not he will die, but there is nobility  in being able to choose some aspects of how he dies. There may be certain things he no longer wants (certain lab draws, intubation, certain medications) and there may be certain things he does want (specific meals, listening to a specific song one last time, so on). Again, those are all things that should be discussed with his doctor and the palliative care team. An unplanned death can be ugly and traumatic, not always but can be. Having the patient, family, and care team ready for death can relieve some of the suffering at the time of demise.

It very well could be that your uncle recognizes he is dying and that his method of coping is a cheery denial.

In any case, a summary of my opinion would be:

- your uncle should be informed of his change in status and his likely death so that he can make decisions about his medical care and have some control over his final days

- that should be done by his care team (probably the physician) and hopefully with the help of palliative care

- your family's role should be to support your uncle and spend time with him making his last days as enjoyable as possible",t3_chptv9,,2019-07-26 18:17:06,/r/cancer/comments/chptv9/my_uncle_is_dying_and_he_doesnt_realize_it/ev1tt76/,r/cancer,,

If there's anyone who you trust and feel comfortable with besides you are your wife that can come with you, ask questions, TAKE NOTES, etc. it can be very helpful.

\- What are the next steps/next few months like?

\- Is this curable?

\- What is the 5 year survival (some cancers can be eliminated by best possible detection methods but invariably come back)

\- Is \[insert treatment plan here\] expected to cure the cancer or just prolong life without curing/ease discomfort? (may be answered by previous questions)

\- Will your wife be able to bear children after this? (if that's important to you)

\- How do people tend to feel while undergoing treatment? Asymptomatic? Fatigued? Nauseous? Pain?

\- Should your wife expect to have to take time off of work/other activities due to the effects of treatment?

\- What are warning signs we should look for (once starting treatment) that should prompt us to come to the hospital?

\- Are there any support groups for patients/families of patients with similar cancers?

\- Where can I go/what resources can I use to learn more about this type of cancer and it's treatment?

\- If we wanted to seek out a second opinion, who do you consider an expert in this type of cancer? (no one should get offended by the idea that with a life-altering disease, you would seek multiple opinions)

\- When will we next meet with you (the oncologist)?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Palliative care is NOT the same as hospice. Hospice is a subset of palliative care for people who are terminally ill with less than 6 months to live and who are no longer pursuing treatment that is designed to either cure disease or prolong life; it is purely comfort-based medicine. In contrast, palliative care is basically a paradigm of patient-centered medicine that seeks to identify the patient's priorities and make sure those are paramount as plans of care are formulated. A huge amount of what a palliative care doctor/nurse/social worker does IS focused on comfort (management of pain, nausea, itching, other discomfort) and they are experts in this area and will have incredible amounts of experience with patients who have cancer and are undergoing treatment. However, they will do this alongside your oncologist's planned cancer treatment and it is/can be done without in any way altering the course of treatment for the cancer. Seeking palliative care is NOT giving up on treating the cancer; it is simply saying that in addition to the things that treat the cancer, lets also focus on the patient and make sure she is as comfortable as possible (oncologists will typically prescribe anti-pain/anti-nausea/etc meds as needed and do a good job of it, but palliative care providers are the dedicated experts in this area). The other thing that palliative care does is sit down with you and your wife and help talk about priorities. If your wife has a very curable cancer, than obviously the goal will be to cure the cancer and the necessity for talking through priorities is less important. However, if things have taken an unfortunate turn and it is a cancer that has low chance of being cured, then the work that a palliative care team does can be much more important here. If there's a 30% chance of curing the cancer by undergoing treatment that will be painful/uncomfortable/significantly reduce quality of life, would she want it? What about if the chance of cure was 5%? If undergoing treatment meant that she would live 18 months instead of 12 months, but with a lower quality of life, would that be preferable, or would a comfortable 12 months be better? These are questions that sometimes don't come up organically with an oncologist, whose paradigm may be to treat the cancer as aggressively as possible, but should be fundamental parts of planning treatment for any chronic/life-altering disease. Palliative care doctors (and oncologists) also may work as part of multidisciplinary teams that include people like social workers who may help guide you and your wife toward support groups, financial resources that may be helpful, other resources. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a lot of information; I hope it is helpful. This is far more than you may need for this first visit? I have also written much of this focusing a little more on the possibility of a poor (non-curable) prognosis, because people who have not-easily-curable disease may need more help with some of these issues. However, I want you to understand and remember that many, many cancers are very curable and in a year or two or five, you may be looking back on this as a (big) road bump that your wife and you overcame as part of your long lives together.",t3_cm1ods,,2019-08-05 00:57:02,/r/cancer/comments/cm1ods/at_the_hospital_they_think_my_wife_has_cancer/evzt7dy/,r/cancer,,

effthebrcas,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_cq58y2,3,ewv8657,"I think these are questions for your oncologist.
Discuss what symptoms your dad is having from the chemo, and which are from the cancer.  The fluid in his belly that is causing so much discomfort--that is due to the cancer not the chemo. (They can remove it but due to the cancer it reaccumulates quickly, so you only get short term relief. Which can be worth it depending on the situation).  The constipation is likely from chemo/narcotics and exacerbated by the fluid in his belly.

There are forms of chemo that are for palliative relief rather than therapeutic.
And there are many different types of chemo, sometimes many multiple options for the same cancer.  The last chemo I was on really limited my quality of life. This new one, I almost feel normal again.  You might ask the oncologist if there is one that is tolerated better.

Also pain relief--those drugs cause so many problems. Really really try to get his constipation improved. Ask if Lyrica would help as an adjunct to the pain meds. It helps with chronic and nerve pain and might help reduce fatigue.  Maybe there are other pain control options as well?

it sounds like she has been through a few different kinds of chemo and the later types of chemo and immunotherapy haven't been as effective as hoped.  At some point you and your mom should talk seriously about her goals and what she wants to accomplish with her remaining time, how she wants to go, where she wants to be, and who she wants to see.  No one knows how much time she has left and she might find a miracle drug, but realistically its hard to tolerate chemo/targeted therapy/be on a clinical trial on top of all the fluid and nutrition losses within the ascites. 

For the rapidly reaccumulating ascites you could ask for a pleurX catheter to be implanted in her belly, so she can drain the fluid at home every couple days and be comfortable.  If she does find effective treatment to dry the ascites you can always get the catheter removed later.

My FIL passed from metastatic prostate cancer at the beginning of this year. I'm not sure how advanced your fathers is other than your mention that it spread to the bone, but in FIL's case he was diagnosed with a met in a bone and actually went on to survive about 5 years. He went through all treatments in the book - hormone therapy first, then radiation, immunotherapy, chemo and finally an experimental protocol in Germany (look up prostate cancer lutetium therapy). All this to say that if he wants to try treatment, perhaps it's worth a second opinion to see what his different options are. Originally FIL was told 1-2 years with treatment, so you never know exactly what is going to happen.

That said I also don't want to give false hope, cancer is a bitch of a disease. It also hurts that at first you hear prostate cancer and think 'oh, well that has a high rate of curability so I'm not too worried' and have to swallow the fact that the rates for Stage IV are quite different. I can only offer my anecdote that he lived a relatively normal life for about 3.5 years. Near the end, perhaps even the last year was when he began to struggle more. The spread was throughout the liver and lungs and the treatments had taken their toll. He passed in palliative care, peacefully and surrounded by family.

&gt; I'm still particularly confused by what the masses ""abutting"" his pancreas mean

It means that the tumors are seen in close proximity to the pancreas on the imaging. For example see this study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647171/ (We defined patients with tumors abutting the diaphragm when tumors were near the diaphragm (&lt; 5 mm) on axial CT scan imaging.)

&gt; If the upcoming CT scan shows that his tumors have decreased in size a lot, would it be possible or beneficial to do surgery?

In the case of metastasis, unfortunately surgery is no longer curative. Since it is not possible to remove all of the cancer cells surgically, chemotherapy and other systemic therapies are the best options to prolong surivival. However, surgery can be performed for palliative purposes, such as alleviating dysphagia, pain, obstruction, etc. on a case-by-case basis.

&gt; does this usually mean that the chemo is working well or that the chemo drugs are getting less effective?

It's probably difficult to say anything about efficacy, based on the side effects that he is experiencing, before he's had another scan.

Listen to podcasts. But I do not force myself to do anything. When I start to feel better, I make sure I leave the house. I have a standing weekly hair appointment. (I only lost hair twice and now it’s thick and almost to the waist.) I’m not working anymore, so I leave the house for that or I wouldn’t get dressed, and that appointment starts me up again, makes me want to meet with friends and shop or whatever. I have taken an exercise class for cancer patients, I may learn to sew. I make sure I have anti-nauseas, headache medication, and anything that helps as needed.

I think it’s important that you look for the good things in your life, even though it’s hard right now, and try to focus on those. Put it in perspective, it may just be a hard six months and then you’ll recover. So do self-care until then. 

Here are tips:
Schedule outings for days you know you’ll be well enough. 
Take hot baths. 
Journal 
Downgrade reading as concentrating can be hard. Color if you are artistic-you don’t have to think but you’ll at least see color. 
Get some fresh air as often as you can and notice this beautiful world. 
Don’t force yourself to eat what you don’t like because people have told you to. Have a cupcake for breakfast if it’s easy on the gut. 
Zofran, compezine, Ativan should be there for you when nauseated. Maybe even something stronger for headaches. If your onc won’t prescribe them, find a new one. 
Take walks. 
Binge a TV show. 
It’s okay to cry but that has to end. Give yourself a treat after every infusion and plan a big one for the end! It’s a countdown! Unless, like me, you have a terminal cancer, this will end! (Well, mine will too...)Remember that. 
Keep a sense of humor, laugh at something daily. And remember, you are going through something many will not. That gives you knowledge they can’t have, especially about how strong you are. 
You also learn who real friends are. 

One more thing:chemo often gets easier, so your headaches may go away. If not, remember that smells are stronger for you and maybe that makes it worse, so no smelly foods. If you still have hair, a high pony can hurt. So watch those external forces too.

Whydishappennn,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_d0p002,2,ezg5ndi,"My dad wasn’t a survivor, but had a period where he was in remission from beating a tumor in his hypopharynx. Some of these effects we only knew he had from going through his room and medications after he died, he kept many quiet. 

The side effects after radiation/chemo involved:

- Dry mouth resulting in hard, thick saliva that he carried a massive box of tissues around to spit out so he could be understood.

- a much weaker voice

- inability to swallow more than a sip of water, as his esophagus had strictured from  radiation damage and not being used. He had a GI feed tube in his stomach. It would have been a year and surgery until he could have recovered from that and a slow journey to food again. 

- fluid in his lungs because anything he couldn’t swallow would leak down the pipe that was open

- nerve damage down his right arm

- physio to relearn swallowing and use of his damaged neck muscles

- heartburn/bad acid reflux somehow

- digestive issues, to put it lightly 

- mental fog, forgetfulness

- temperature sensitivity

- fatigue

- lymphedema in the face/neck 


He was positive despite all of this, and determined to get better. His bravery and strength facing all of this was indescribable. 

Had his sudden neck tumor been operable, he would have had muscles in his neck removed, more nerve damage, pain, possible loss of function in some nerves in his face, etc,  in the end that was too risky so he started palliative care and a clinical trial to cure the neck cancer... but the side effects made his body too weak to continue.

I was not his immediate caretaker, but I spent a lot of time with my FIL in the time leading up to his death. 

The first thing I would say is that you will very likely want some assistance from hospice/palliative care - where I live they can set this up at home or in a facility, whatever the patient wishes assuming they have a little time (at least a few days to get set up for home hospice). This will ensure that your mother is kept as comfortable as possible - she'll likely be offered (and should take) a morphine drip or similar for pain management. 

As things come closer to the end, she'll stop eating/drinking and she'll mostly sleep a lot. Her breathing may become laboured and you will start to hear the 'death rattle'. It's very unsettling, though the palliative care doctor we had assured us that it is much more frightening for the family than the patient who usually does not really notice, assuming they are on pain medications. There are medications they can give to ease the rattle though, we chose this. 

He passed very quickly - 3 days after choosing palliative care. The first two nights my MIL stayed up all night talking about the arrangements he wished for and everything else on his mind. Your mother will likely want to talk about those things too. It also helps the people they leave behind, to know what they want as the choices are frankly overwhelming. 

The best advice I can give is to just be there. It's a horrible thing, but you are giving your mother an incredible gift by simply being there. FIL never wanted to be the center of attention and passed while there were many of us surrounding him and talking to each other - a family member noticed he had gone while we were chatting about one of his first dates with his wife. It was heartbreaking, but in a way it has helped to know he passed surrounded by love and in as much peace as we could give him.

I send you warmth and hugs in this terrible time for your family.",t3_d7aukw,,2019-09-23 15:39:39,/r/cancer/comments/d7aukw/my_mother_has_been_given_weeks_to_live/f18663v/,r/cancer,,
Goordon,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_d822ai,0,f1a1jsf,"I want to preface what im going to tell you by saying that every case is completely different and everyone reacts to treatments like chemo differently. Theres tons of different kinds of cancers. There's tons of different kinds of options and outcomes. What i am telling you is my recent experience with my moms lung cancer.

Now that is out of the way: My mom has been diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer a little more than a month ago. She's 55 years old, got her initial diagnosis when she had incredible back pain, and got an MRI because they assumed something was wrong with her discs / suspected a disc prolapse. The only thing they spotted on that MRI wasnt a disc prolapse, but metastases all over her bones and hip area. The doctors were also complete assholes about it. Told her its cancer, no further information given, sent her home, told her to come back in a few days for treatments @ the oncology station.

The first day on the station they told her that ""everything is still OK and should be well treatable for a few more wonderful enjoyable years"" - ""yes, youre going to die soon but we expect a few good years.""

They did all kinds of biopsy testing, CT, took lung and liver samples ( it has spread to her liver at this point ) prepared a chemo, and started chemo treatment about 2-3 weeks ago. She felt terrible with chemo and things only ever got worse. Her pain got to insane levels even on chemo, additionally she wasnt able to eat anything anymore.

New time left estimate from doctors: ""Ok maybe youve got a few months left, but continue chemo! It's important!""

She got pneumonia and they stopped chemo treatment. She continued to get into a worse shape every single day. At some point she said its unbearable and she wants to cancel all treatments. The next chemo treatment wouldve been ~3 weeks later anyways so the docs still gave her the option to continue if she happens to feel better ""later"".

At this point the doctors gave her 2 months with chemo, and weeks without.

Well.... Fast forward to ""later"", basically ""now"". She wanted to die. And it wasnt even really an option, it was clear at this point that the fight was lost. The docs more or less agreed with it, but seemed a bit angry. Probably because they weren't able to ""sell"" her another chemo. At this point the only thing she consumes these days is higher doses of morphine via her chemo port. She feels ""good"" due to the morphine and other drugs, shes artificially happy. And im glad it is this way, because before, she was really REALLY worried about dying, crying all day. Which is completely understandable. At this point i just dont want her to suffer anymore. She forgot she's got cats, she forgot she's got kids. At the same time she still recognises me occasionally ( her son.. ). Maybe there are metastases in her brain now.

Her palliative care doc said she should feel fine and she remembers all the good things now. We got her out of the hospital, brought her to my sister so she can have a few peaceful last days wihout noisy people in the same room etc. Another thing the palliative care doctor said that kind of shocked me a bit, but in hindsight its probably correct: The docs shouldve definitely known that, with the level of spread of her Stage IV cancer there wasnt much time left and any treatment wouldve been pointless anyways. The initial ""You'll have some years"" prediction was absoloute bullshit. So basically it wouldve been better to accept it the way it is, get some good painkillers, and spend another wonderful 2 weeks together, outside of the hospital. Instead, filled with hope, like any other sane human would ( AND SHOULD! ) be, we hoped the treatment was going to help. Sadly it didnt. And now i've got the worst feelings of regret. But I'm working on it! I shouldnt feel bad in any way about this!

She was supposed to die this weekend, its Monday now, still alive. Basically waiting for ""the call"" any moment now. And even if it sounds horrible, it'd be some kind of relief, because i'd know she doesnt have to suffer anymore.

Why am i telling you all of this you might ask, it sounds horrible. I want to encourage you but this is the only personal experience ive ever had with cancer, and i just want you to know that things can go both ways. If i had the option to go back in time and change anything about my behavior in this whole situation i wouldve probably changed nothing. In the end, theres always hope. And every cancer case is completely different. So try treatment. No matter the chances. Maybe the chemo youre gonna get ""just works"" for your mom. I want you to fight. Maybe youve got ACTUAL years left.

My case is unfortunate, maybe yours isnt. But keep in mind - cancer is a bitch. Prepare for anything.",t3_d822ai,,2019-09-23 23:59:19,/r/cancer/comments/d822ai/my_mom_was_diagnosed_with_lung_cancer_friday/f1a1jsf/,r/cancer,,

Honestly, it's probably good to lionize those decisions because they're better for practically everyone involved.

However, many, many people conflate that with effective chemotherapy treatment (for anything) or even alternative medicine treatments that do not have proven efficacy as if they are reasonable decisions.  Mix it up in a pot on some weird facebook group and you get these absurdist responses.

HuntTheCattyWumpus,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_dbu9us,3,f240cix,"Not an expert, but had a parent with pancreatic cancer that had spread to the liver.

If the cancer originated from the pancreas, your mom does not have liver cancer. She has pancreatic cancer. Those cancer cells on her liver are *from* her pancreas.

Edit to add: The following is based on pancreatic cancer. Some will apply to other cancers. But, I think that most cancer in the liver is usually from a different location that has spread there. So, please hold off on your research until you have the full diagnosis with staging. 

Treatment goes a couple ways usually. If the tumors are near the ""tail"" of the pancreas, they can do a whipple procedure and remove the tail. Prognosis after that is pretty good. If the tumors are near the ""head"" of the pancreas (closer to the liver), they usually won't be able to remove the tumors.

The tumors often restrict the flow of bile (I think) or other things that the pancreas does, so they will often put a stent in to help keep things flowing.

Chemotherapy (usually a very strong regimen) will be used. I believe there are treatments every other week, depending on how well it is tolerated. Often my parent had to take breaks because it was so difficult. See this page for some ideas of what they will do: https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/pancreatic-cancer.html My parent's experience with chemo was pretty bad. It is very challenging, and they lost a lot of weight, were hospitalized many times, but did achieve some partial remission and was symptom free for part of a year. It will always come back, and once it does there isn't a lot that can be done except for palliative care. They lived for 1.5 years and were a shell of their former self when they passed.

I would get your mom to the BEST cancer center you can afford and that you can travel to. MD Anderson is good, but there are others on par with them. Most treatment plans are going to be similar, but having the best doctors will only help. Seek out clinical trials as well.

My piece of advice... If it is pancreatic cancer, decide if you want to go through chemo or not. Both scenarios are bad, but if she is somewhat symptom free right now, enjoy life while she can.

I'm not sure about not being able to pay. 

I would wait to find a true diagnosis with staging, determine a treatment plan, and then yes, go on the trip if she can. Go with her if you want. It might be an amazing trip and provide you with wonderful memories.

I'm really sorry about your mom. This will likely be the hardest thing that you both have gone through. It will be hard. Be prepared with a good support system and rally the troops because if it is pancan, you will need help.

Once you get the diagnosis, please reach out to pancan.org for help. They can guide you and help you find resources, clinical trials, provide assistance and get you in touch with the right people.

My doctor said that the only chemo available to me at that point would have been the hard shit that would have massively impacted my quality of life, and given that he estimated that chemo had a less than 15% chance of working and could only prolong my life not save it, I decided to just spend the reminder of my days chilling with my gorgeous head of hair and seeing my friends. It's hard though. I believe that I made the correct decision for me. But I don't want to die. I catch myself thinking that I should have done chemo and tried to scrape out more time and I resent myself for giving up... but fuck, the reality is that regardless of what I picked, I was dead a while ago. And chemo would have really sucked for me. 

One thing my doctor said is that at this point in treatment, there is no right or wrong choice, there is only the choice that is right for you. I'm proud of you for doing chemo. I wish I could give you a big spreadsheet telling you when to quit and when to keep fighting on. You know you can quit whenever you want, so pressure's off there at least. I hope this chemo gets you lots more time.

I posted an article onto this sub about how to treat terminal patients. It provided a lot of food for thought for people in our situation and I'd recommend reading it if you haven't already.",t3_dd3voc,,2019-10-04 23:44:44,/r/cancer/comments/dd3voc/a_question_for_those_with_incurable_disease/f2gms6d/,r/cancer,,
sketchypeg,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ddzx7a,3,f2uca2m,"I lost my dad last week (sept 30, 2019) to stage 4 metestatic lung cancer that had spread to his liver, bones and his brain.

on august 12 he was given 6-12 months and started hospice care for pain management at the beginning of September.  He didn't receive any cancer treatment, just palliative care. I am astounded by how little time he actually had. I thought we would have the holidays. maybe. but we only made it a month and a half past the day he was diagnosed.

I suggest doing whatever your mom feels up to doing, and not taking it too personally if she changes her mind. we came in to town (I live 7 hours away and my brother lives 2 hours away) to take my dad someplace he always wanted to go, but all he had energy for that day was a shower.

if she is up to seeing friends and family, keep them close, but don't be offended if she is too exhausted or too depressed to always want to have visitors.

I drove all over Cleveland buying my dad anything - any snack, any milkshake, malt, burger, anything that he might take a bite or sip of, just to give him a few calories. usually they went untouched, but he still needed options.

we treated my dad's pain and agitation with morphine, thc gummies, Ativan, and cbd oil. (he was on several other meds, but he found those the most helpful)

the end is heartbreaking. he needed someone with him around the clock. he lost his strength.  last Thursday I walked in the door and my dad had fallen on the bathroom floor and had been laying by himself there for over an hour and a half. I had to call paramedics to help him because even though he only weighed about 96 lbs at this point, I couldn't safely lift him. the rest of the week was spent on the couch. the brain metastases took the use of his legs away from him. he had to wear diapers,  which I changed for him. he felt humiliated, like a helpless baby,  despite my best efforts. his liver began to fail quickly, which you can tell by the smell and dark color of the urine. he stopped eating, and needed help getting sips of water. I had to start grinding his meds up and putting them into drinks and bites of food. we spent most of our time listening to music, me rubbing his head and helping him stay calm until the hospice nurses felt he needed to be transferred to the hospice facility (he was scared and agitated because he couldn't catch his breathand they felt they could control his symptoms better there) and they told me I had time to shower and meet him there instead of going in the ambulance with him, but they were wrong. he passed with a nurse holding his hand, not me. so make sure you're giving hugs and kisses and sharing your love because it can drag out and then end suddenly.

another issue is all of the end of life stuff people don't do. if your mother is of sound mind and doesn't have any end of life plans in place, I suggest trying to get the basics worked out. ask the hard questions if she hasn't already planned things like her funeral, where her assets will go.  even if you personally don't care about it - it's an overwhelming mess your family will have to deal with so it's better to get started now and to ask questions now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry you're going through this. this has been the worst week of my life. taking care of him was difficult but id give almost anything to be back in his living room running my hands through his hair and telling him he's going to be alright.",t3_ddzx7a,,2019-10-07 01:47:40,/r/cancer/comments/ddzx7a/stage_four_lung_cancer/f2uca2m/,r/cancer,,

Cancer happens when genes replicate. We have 2 copies of every gene. If one becomes damaged then we have a back up. If both become damaged then cancer develops. 

Yes in some cases immune therapy has been successful but not is not the case with stage 4 cancers. When cancer is stage 4 it means that cells feom the primary cancer has broken off and traveled to distant parts of the body and start growing there.  At this point treatment changes from ""curative"" to ""palliative"" which means they no longer try to cure you but rather give you more time while keeping quality of life in mind.

My beautiful younger brother passed away yesterday after just turning 34. He had sarcoma. He had gotten a blood clot that went to his lungs. The day after, he checked himself out of the ICU against medical advice. He refused to go the ER for days before his passing but still insisted he wanted to live. I cannot explain how tormenting this was for us and him. I wanted to call the ambulance anyway but kept getting outvoted. Honestly, I don't know how Im typing at all currently through my shock and tears.

We were able to get hospice his last couple days but it didn't help us much.  His girlfriend and I were with him for his passing, so he was not alone. I won't tell you how it affected me to be there for that unless you really want to know but I will say that I believe he was aware of what was going on however he was not in pain and his final moments were peaceful for him.

First, you need to decide if you would rather be in the hospital or at home when you pass. If you want to try to continue getting treatment with a hope for NED or a cure, please always go to the hospital when you have an issue and stay in the hospital until the doctors tell you it's ok to go home. I suggest you get hospice and palliative care on board now. They will come to your home if that is what you want versus going to a home.  Make sure you tell your family or close friends what you want to happen after you pass and what measures you are willing/not willing to have done to keep you alive. Getting them on board early enough will help you and your family to only have to worry about your time together versus taking care of everything else that may physically come your way.

When it comes your time, you will start going through the stages of dying. If you really want to know how it will probably happen, you can search that. I recommend adding the word hospice, whether you use them or not, to your search for the best answers. My brother passed in almost the exact way these say it happens. We played his favorite music in the background and gently loved on him. The nurses had him decently sedated from the previous day  on. They also were giving him anti-anxiety meds to keep him calm. He was able to respond and would wake up off and on for a few minutes then go back to sleeping. The thing about pain control is you have to get ahead of it before it really starts. I am sure that my brother was not in pain. I'm pretty sure that he was not fearful, even though he would have been a week earlier. I think he went through his own private journey in the last few days of acceptance. I am also sure that he was still aware enough to know we were there for him. If you don't want to know at all that it is happening, I'm sure they can make that possible, although hospice/hospitals probably won't admit that. So tell someone you trust and they will make it happen.

If you are in decent health state currently, go on a trip. An hour or two away if that is all you can handle. Make some memories with others. Go see that thing you always wanted to but put off. Seriously, do it now. You may have 6 months left or you may have two weeks left. Medicine cannot really tell you. Record some video for your loved ones to have when you are gone. Sit outside and really enjoy the sun on your face, the smell of fresh air and the birds songs. Fill your soul up as much as you can.

I am so sorry you are in this position. I am sending you strength and comfort.",t3_dh41xb,,2019-10-13 15:34:59,/r/cancer/comments/dh41xb/incurableterminalinoperable_community/f3lysj8/,r/cancer,,

She was in hospital for 2.5 weeks and the acute palliative care for about 5 days. 
Because of the nature of her spread she wasn’t able to eat or drink anything without it coming back up. She was on heavy pain killers and slept more and more of each day. The few days before she passed she was basically out of it all day, or if she was awake she was in too much pain to interact. My last real conversation with her was probably 5 days before she died. 
The day she died she started having very laboured breathing about an hour before passing. The doctors believe it was likely a blot clot (from inactivity) that travelled to her lungs.  
It was tough watching that last hour - more than any of the previous three weeks. The doctors gave her heavier pain killers but it still looked like she was struggling. Her breathing became more “gaspy” and more time between each breath. There were a few breaths I thought were her last before she drew another 10 or 20 seconds later.

Does the doctor know she's delirious, maybe he/she can prescribe anti-psychotic medication, like haldol  
Does it look like she's in pain? Maybe she can get more pain medication. If swallowing is a problem maybe she can get something like a transdermal patch and/or Abstral (you can just place it under your tongue and it dissolves)  
Maybe morphine if she has trouble breathing (metastases in lungs?). One thing I'd like to add: when a person is on his/her last days and has 'trouble breathing', it sounds unpleasant to the family, but it doesn't always mean he or she actually feels any discomfort.  

I'm not a doctor and I know very little of your mom's situation, these are just a couple of solutions used in palliative care. A lot of problems can be solved  
It's important that you or a family member has good contact with the doctor. Just tell him/her (or the nurses for that matter) about all of her symptoms if he/she comes by and ask if there's anything that can be done

She was on Gem/Cap starting from February onwards. Side effects were minimal, though her appetite was down. We thought the chemo was working well until she developed ascites in June 2019, which was diagnosed as malignant ascites in early July 2019.

But, I accept the compliment, explain that I'm working basically non-stop on keeping my basic shit together and try to be as present as possible in every situation. 

The fucked up part about the euthanasia debate is that palliative care doctors will flat out tell you that there will come a point where you withdraw feeding (because it is feeding the cancer and not the patient) and the pain is so great that the levels of morphine needed will hasten death. And that is legal. 

It's weird, I've realized that I handle my parents how I wish they had handled me as a teenager: I listen, I'm present, I do not judge, and I support their decisions. I trust them that they know themselves well enough to know what they want and to ask for advice if they want or need it. That seems to be the best way for me to handle it, and it gives them their space to do what they need to do while still feeling supported. 

I know it is going to get harder, and I am doing what I can to prepare for it while also understanding no one can actually prepare for this. It's terrible. It is unfair. It makes no sense.

I can relate to the rage. Why me? It's so hard for me to see drug addicts and homeless people who have healthy bodies and just don't get how bad it is to know your body not only has betrayed you, but also is likely to betray you anytime with a whole new set of cancers. I know they have a really tough time, but i just want to go up to them and say your body is fine. You are so lucky. I feel bad for thinking that.
There are a lot of things you need to consider. Do you have support? I live alone with cancer. That's tough. So you have one good. Also, you will live. It's surprising how important that is once you have cancer. You will live.

He was linked up to home hospice care at diagnosis by virtue of the bleak prognosis around pan can.

Just wanted to share a story of hope because I have been where you are, worrying that a loved one is experiencing all of their ""lasts"". 

Also, hospice sounds scary, but it is the best dang thing. Statistically people with hospice/palliative care in place tend to live a bit longer than those without and they also are less likely to go through a traumatic death (in the Emergency Room or ICU for example). The nurses that help care for my partner have been absolutely amazing and the constant care/health checks have helped us to avoid major catastrophe because he's more likely to mention that something is bothering him while the nurse is there (as opposed to actually making an additional appointment to see his doc if he is feeling unwell).

serpentinequeen,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_f8loojo,11,f8lv19j,"I debated on DMing you but I feel if others come across this post in the future, they should know this. 

The cancer spread in his lungs. He had a high fever and had to be hospitalized. After that hospitalization, his condition worsened and he couldn’t walk anymore. At that point, we started palliative because he was in a lot of pain and chemo was no longer possible, but he still wanted to try and prevent death. 

It wasn’t until his primary doctor did his first home visit to tell us hospice was the best choice in order to prevent pain and give him a comfortable life. The decline was slow in our eyes; idk if we just chose not to see it. Just moving him in his bed caused him great pain. We genuinely thought my father could keep fighting because he believed it too. The nurses would tell us hospice isn’t necessarily a death sentence, but I know now they say that because you really can’t know for sure how the body can handle the cancer.  

He had another fever while under hospice. They tell you you have a choice at this point: call 911 and revoke hospice so he can go to the hospital and possibly put his body under more stress or simply give him pain medication and wait for the end. 

We opted for the latter after his approval. 

His first day in the hospice facility was fine, it looked like he improved actually. But less than 8 hours later, our mother who stayed overnight with him informs us that he couldn’t wake up that morning and was very confused. The left side of his body wasn’t moving as much anymore. 

The doctors told us that these symptoms indicated the cancer likely moved to his brain. He was regressing and it was time for us to tell our family to say their goodbyes. 

After this, the next three days we saw his communication completely decline. He couldn’t keep his eyes focused, they rolled to the back of his head, we had to constantly repeat ourselves only for him to give us brief one-word answers. If he had the energy, he could say whole sentences. His last sentence to us was the one mentioned above in my post, where he gave us the grimace of a sob and said “all my people are here”. 

After that, he was unresponsive. Anytime he would wake up, he’d moan and fidget to let us know he was feeling pain. We always asked the nurse to give him Morphine and Haldol during these waking moments so he wouldn’t feel anything. Eventually, he couldn’t eat or drink anything or else he could choke. 

Im sorry this became so long winded, but I just want you to truly know what to expect because I spent hours scouring the internet to prepare myself. But the truth is that everyone’s different. Nothing will truly prepare you for it. 

They say mottling and skin discoloring on the fingers and toes indicates imminent death. Their breathing slows, with 18-25 seconds between breath as their blood pressure drops too. The sides of their skull, on each side of their eyes hollows out. Their eyes begin to develop dark circles. They begin to smell like flowers, fruit, or sweet rotting meat. Their breaths have a rattle to them (though this is hard to tell sometimes because my father had cancer in his lungs that caused a lot of mucus and rattling). 

Sometimes none of these signs occur, sometimes only some of them, sometimes all of them. 

For my father, it was only his blood pressure that dropped. This quick decline all happened within the span of 10 days, and we were surprised he lasted that long because he hadn’t been able to eat or get a proper drink in 8 days. 

Im so sorry you’re going through this too. I wish no one had to go through this horrible grief but unfortunately with life comes death. 

Please have the serious conversations with your father now. Ask him what he wants you to do after his passing. Does he want to be cremated or buried? Does he want to say goodbye to someone? Where does he want his final resting place to be? Get it in writing if possible, or on video so any relatives won’t give you a hard time about your decisions afterward. 

Most of all, remind him how much you love him. Remind him that you will be okay, that he can go in peace without any worries.

I too have a metastatic cancer (breast) and plan to utilize Medical assistance in dying.  In Canada we have to request M.A.I.D then wait 10 days then be able to give oral consent while completely lucid and so many are dying much earlier than they actually want or need to out of fear of missing this sometimes very small window of opportunity. 

This is actually one of the things many are fighting to have changed here. There needs to be a clause added to the act that allows for those of us living with a terminal illness to pre-consent to M.A.I.D. 

This is something that I worry about. And so I have advanced directives that state that I am not to be provided with any life supporting measures, only comfort care after being placed in a medically induced coma. This only applies to a cancer related end of life. If I am in a car accident for example and have conditions that are survivable and allows for me to return to a similar state of being prior to the accident then by all means do what is necessary. But if I am clearly in my last weeks or months of life, what is the point?

MissingMyDog,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_e3qpvk,5,f94ma68,"It’s normal to be scared. I went through 45 sessions (stage IIIc, Mets) Last five were intensive.

You’ll be ‘mapped’ out first, and then have your first practice session. You just have to lie still. It’s daunting at first with that big machine whirring around you making strange buzzing and clicking noises.

It might feel a bit awkward at first because you’re naked from the top up, and the techs have to move you into position without your help. Think jellyfish.

(When you’re mapped —not sure if that’s the right word— you’ll be given a few small dot tattoos.)

Not everyone burns. Hopefully as you’re Stage I that will mean a lighter treatment.

I did burn after two weeks. If it happens, they have ointments and special gel bandages that help. Don’t quit. Once you show burns, you may as well go on. I promise you’ll heal.

You might get a burn on your neck and on the treatment area. Try to not wear a bra or constrictive clothing. I wore a light jogging bra that was a couple sizes too big, but only to hold the gel bandages in place and because I’m a C-cup ( Or was, I’m now a b and c).

It’s tiring, and it may just be because you have the sessions five days a week. I took public transportation for the most part. I also had trouble with nausea as I was on morphine. 

Waiting for the sessions some of us worked on this giant puzzle. Sometimes in silence, but some of the best people I have ever met in my life I met there. 

There will be patients there who are receiving palliative radiation. You may meet some very ill people. Radiation treatment may be punishing treatment for some—especially for those receiving it on their heads or torso.

Everyone deserves respect in there, beyond the waiting room, but especially those patients and their loved ones. This is end-stage for them. I remember each one that I was fortunate enough to meet.

My best friend developed breast cancer a few years after my diagnosis. We were both diagnosed young. Her approach was different than mine. She sort of pretended nothing was happening. (She was Stage II, no Mets). Whatever works for you is fine.

They’ll play music during the sessions which last a quick 10- 15 minutes. Going to my last session felt like I was going to a trip to Paris, I was so happy. 

You’ll be okay. And happy when it’s over. If you have any symptoms, they’ll help you. They’ve seen it all. I’m Canadian and just to save me a trip to the drug store, the techs would supply me with the gel bandages and other bandages I needed once they noticed my burns (which may not happen to you.)

Skin colour, sensitivity and your tendency to burn might factor in as well. (But radiation burns from the inside out.)

A month and a half ago he barely had anything showing up on his PET scan, then two weeks later he was riddled with little tumors. Talk to your mom about palliative care. It’s not the same as hospice, so that helped my dad with making the decision to enter into it because, to him, hospice meant giving up entirely. Palliative is there to treat the symptoms while they go through treatment and can help figure out a way to keep your mom comfortable. 

Watching is definitely the most difficult part for the loved ones. It’s frightening and sickening to watch your loved one waste away in front of your eyes. Seek help for yourself, whether that be therapy or just spending time with friends and venting. I have been part-time caretaker for my dad and in the beginning I felt the same way you do—that I wanted to be with him 24/7. It gave me anxiety to leave him. Once I would get back to work, though, it was a comfort to have a sense of normalcy and be able to dig in and let work take some of the constant worry off of my mind. To worry about something other than just my dad. 

I’m on leave from work now and my dad is in hospice. Everyone told me that I would know the right time to take leave and be with him and it’s pretty much true. I opted to start my leave before he basically became comatose so that I could spend time with him while he’s still lucid and I know I won’t regret it. The doctors and nurses have seen this enough to be able to give you a bit of a timeline that can help you decide when is the right time to take leave and be with your mom. 

Sorry the reply was so long, but I hope it helps.

Skoll__Hati,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_e7ykd6,5,fa8vdjs,"Hello domith88, Im an MD outside the US with experience on Palliative Care. I know how confusing it is to deal with these situations and how hard it is to not feel guilt. In the face of severe illness the one thing I believe is most important is to share experiences. I am sure the trip you took your cousin to the woods was the right thing to do, for even if it seems mundane to others, the pleasure that derives from these little things is extremely important. It also creates happy memories that you can remember him by after he is gone. Ill be very general, an explicitly state that not all cancers can be treated the same way, the treatment does noes respond the same way and their progression is not comparable. Radiation is indeed a good way to treat bone pain in this context, however it is considered part of palliative care (it does not have the intent of curing, it has the objetive of reducing the size of the tumor or preventing complications, such as fractures. If you cousin has throat cancer with bone lesions, i get the impression it is at a non curable stage but this by no means is synonymous of terminal disease). The treatment only makes sense if the person has a significant improvement in his or her quality of life, if the improvement is minimal, the pain you put a person through is not justifiable (I am well aware that even the act of moving from chair to bed could be a very painfull experience if not done properly). While i am in no position to offer medical advice, i kindly suggest you speak to your cousin over his preferences and never keep out of sight that quality of life is what matters. It is hard, but in some cases, it is better to live fewer days than live double that amount but with significant side effects or symptoms secondary to the progression of the disease. Dont be afraid of the pain meds, they are there to be used and i firmly believe that no one has to go on with non controlled pain in this day and age since we have many a medicament to be used, for example, if he has severe pain that is suddenly present, the use of immediate release Morphine could be considered. I suggest you seek out confort with friends and family, for the prevailing sense of helplessness is crushing   and you do not really have to face it alone. I hope my words will give you some confort.

P.S If you ever get to talk to his doctors, please do not hesitate to ask.

cheekeemonkee,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_fb5rkl5,1,fb7ki5o,"Yes! Having just gone through this with my mom I have some advice:

Get a palliative care consult asap. Palliative specialists advocate for and treat the whole person and family through times of critical illness. N.B. Palliative medicine is not hospice (although it's common for palliative providers to also do hospice care). Palliative medicine is for anyone of any age at any stage of critical illness. This is especially important for people just starting their cancer journey. Consult early and often. Palliative specialists may be an MD, NP, or DO and have prescription privileges (at least in the States) for narcotics.

If the current pain regimen is not working, request another consult. It took a week of adjustments for the palliative specialist to find a regimen that worked for my mom. It was well worth it.

ETA: As /u/mondo (MD) noted, there are a number of factors that influence pain management decisions. Part of the reason it was difficult to find a reliable regimen for my mom was balancing pain control and functionality. If the dosing was too high she was lethargic but when it was too low her pain levels were 7+/10. Her goal was never to be pain-free--just to bring the level down to 3 or 4 which for her, was manageable.

Some of her doctors were overly hesitant to prescribe any pain medication which seemed odd given that she was stage 4 with painful bone metastases. Introducing a palliative specialist helped in terms of educating the doctors (as well as us) and helping navigate expectations.",t3_ebkqd0,,2019-12-17 14:24:28,/r/cancer/comments/ebkqd0/morphine/fb7ki5o/,r/cancer,,

I currently have bone mets to my spine and have been on my 1st. Line treatment gor the past 2 yrs. 

So her options are going to vary depending on the type of breast cancer she had before it metastasized, whether it was hormone driven or Her2. Where in her brain the met is and if she has mets else where. It can range from chemo to radiation to surgery to all three. 

As soon as cancer becomes metastatic all treatment goes from being of a curative nature to a palliative one. 

Also like Terminal doesn't mean die tomorrow or next week. Palliative also doesn't mean end of life.  Infact the earlier palliative team becomes involved the better quality of life those living with stage 4 cancers have. The palliative team does so much more than people realize. They are there to help with pain management, accessing social and psychological care as well. 

I know it is scary and unexpected. Have an honest conversation with your mom about what HER expectations are. What her limits are regarding how far she wants to take treatments and what she considers a good quality of life. Help her get affairs in order such as advanced directives (pre planned medical decisions if there ever comes a time that she is unable to advocate for her self), wills etc.  Being prepared now will help ease her and your mind later.

Maybe there is a disconnect because I suspect they're not trying to say she'll be fine when they know the chemo doesn't usually work and the intent of the chemo is palliative.

From what you've said she has metastatic small cell lung cancer. This is a very serious illness that will take her life. Survival is hard to predict for an individual person but is typically measured in months. One way I find helpful to look at it is that the rate that things have been changing over the last little while, is likely to continue. Eg if there's been a rapid decline over a few weeks, it is possible there are only weeks left and while we hope for the best, we must also plan for the worst case scenario.

Talk to your mom about what is important to her in the time she has left, no matter how long that is.

Lung cancer is a very common cancer which means there is lots of research going on and oncologists see it all the time so its no mystery to them how to treat it. One thing you don't want is a rare cancer. After having cancer no one gets their ""Old Life"" back. After all, they've had cancer and gone through some life-changing events! What does happen is a ""New Life"" comes into being. The ""New Life"" will, in all probability, include regular scans to catch new disease early should it occur. I get CT and MRI scans every three months so I never get much of a chance to not be reminded of the cancer. Many cancer patients report that once done with therapy their life is better than before cancer as they don't live in such a rushed way, they actually do the things they want to do, and they appreciate their loved ones more than ever. We all worry about the cancer returning and it's common to fear every little ache, pain, or twinge is cancer. From my experience, that fear lessons over time. As for having kids, no one is ever sure of the future when considering having kids. I hated having to tell my kids I had cancer, and they're grown, but I would have hated it more not having kids over fear of the future. Kids are tough, love is durable. From what you've said in your post you seem to be reaching the limits of your abilities as a caregiver for your hubby. Consider trading off with other family members, qualified friends, etc. Also, I think the American Cancer Society may be able to help if you call them. Don't run yourself into getting sick and being unable to help at all! A lot of people worry and stress over ""time left"" once they have cancer. Doctors may quote some length of time based on data for the particular cancer and their experience. It's just a best-guess. There is a tremendous amount of research and a huge number of clinical trials going on. New treatments, drugs, novel drug combinations are currently being tested in an effort to treat and maybe one day cure cancer altogether. Honestly, with cancer, it ain't over till it's over! It may be helpful to you to ask if the hospital you use has a Social Worker or some other professional you can talk to about your concerns. My oncologist recently sent me to the Palliative Care &amp; Cancer Support unit of my hospital. It's a great catharsis to be able to talk to a doc and have them just sit and listen rather than trying to finish the visit in the shortest time possible.

You have a difficult task ahead, but please convey the following message to your mom: chemotherapy today works very differently from chemotherapy 30 years ago. Even if a lot of the active ingredients remain the same, doctors now know how to premedicate patients a lot better.

The drugs her doctors gave her to offset the side effects worked so well that she gained 6-7 pounds throughout chemo. She did not feel tired or nauseous or anything bad, really. Also, your mom may be eligible for targeted drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla, Affinitor that do not have nearly as many or as severe side effects to begin with. She could lead a normal life for years on them. 

So try to convince her that her previous experience does not mean that she will suffer from the same side effects today. Tell her how much she means to you and your family and ask her to fight. 

Of course, if you cannot convince her to accept treatment in any way, make sure she receives proper palliative care to make her as comfortable as possible.

I wish you good luck!!!",t3_ez4itg,,2020-02-05 16:00:16,/r/cancer/comments/ez4itg/flying_home_from_asia_to_europe_to_support_my/fgm5mk7/,r/cancer,,

I’ve been thinking a lot recently around the terms like “dying” and “incurable” / “terminal” as often people here confuse them especially if they don’t understand stage 4 cancer.

I’m incurable but at the moment I’m not dying. To me dying is when you are in palliative care. When you’ve stopped living your normal life.

No two people react in the exact same way to the exact same combination of chemotherapy.

His oncologists could, quite possibly, control a lot of the side effects with other medications, too.

At this point, I'd suggest trying all the alternative things with lots of research and anecdotal evidence behind them. Predominately Rick Simpson Oil. It has seemingly brought many back from really late stages of metastatic cancer. Turkey Tail Mushrooms also has a good reputation. There are a few other powerful supplements as well. Some medication my dad was taking for cholesterol had side effects of inflammation and I had him stop, so perhaps see if your dad is taking any meds with bad side effects that he may not really need (doctors hand them out like candy to the elderly for ""preventative mea$ures"")... you'll have to really research them because the companies aren't always transparent.

I was 26 when I was diagnosed in 2016 with osteosarcoma of the pelvis and sacrum. It was my 6th cancer as I have a genetic predisposition to all cancers, but it is the one that has had the biggest impact on my life by far. I had 9 months of brutal inpatient chemo; 3 weeks in hospital on a 24/7 chemo infusion, 2 weeks off. Rinse and repeat. It wasn't really operable so I had proton beam therapy for 3 months following chemo and went into remission, thankfully. I had 2 and a half years clear before having a recurrence in June 2019. 

Unfortunately it's not curable at this point, and am having palliative chemo which is allowing me to be still going strong now, but of course at some point it will stop working. It's a shame that I won't survive this, but I do feel grateful for surviving as much as I have, and I've come a long way towards making my peace with dying. I'm fortunate enough to be able to travel when health permits, and I grab every chance I get to have a new adventure, or seek out a peaceful spot in nature. Despite being terminally ill I still manage to find a lot of joy and love in life.

But like you said OP, it's been a very painful cancer and that's been the biggest challenge, coping with the pain.

Lab assistant when I was diagnosed and have always had a very strong interest in the medical field. I read, alot. When I was diagnosed I made it my mission to understand this disease as best I could, partly because of curiosity mostly because I have a drive to control situations. Knowledge is power and allows me to make the best informed decisions for myself. So I read, alot. I spent the past 24 months learning what I could. Heck I could access my own port if I had to at this point. 

I also made a promise to myself that I would always be honest about my breast cancer and what living while dying is like. I also promised that I would educate people about breast cancer to the best of my ability and to do that I needed to make sure I had the right information. 

So when I give information it is true and factual. It is derived from actual medical resources and resources provided to me by my medical teams, it is from well known cancer societies and based on science and facts. 

I know I sound like a know it all in my responses but it is important that people understand what metastatic and stage 4 means. It is reckless for people to claim they are cancer free when infact no one can actually tell them that. 

By the way, when someone is stage 4 all treatment is of a palliative nature. Surgeries are only performed if their is dire need or it will greatly improve the patients quality of life.  Stage 4 treatment is about gaining more time not curing the cancer. It is hard for people to accept that but that is the reality of it. At some point the treatments no longer work and you run out of options at which point you are prepared for end of life. I could live the next 5-7 years with this disease maybe longer. There are lots of outliers who have stage 4 BC and are in their 20th year. But there are so many more who never make it past the 26th month. 22% live to see their 5th cancerversary.

My son has Stage IV rectal cancer and the pain was so bad that his Fentanyl patches were 300mcg (YES - he had 3 100mcg patches on at the same time) PLUS Oxy for breakthrough. And even that wasn't helping. Thankfully one of the new docs on his palliative care team at his old hospital discussed implanting this kind of pump into his abdomen. Here's how it works:

Medtronic pump is implanted into your abdomen with a catheter fed into your spinal column. The pump is filled with meds (his is Morphine and Bupivicaine). It delivers a steady dose 24/7 - and he has a remote that he puts against the pump for a bolus dose. This pump has saved his life. He's had it for 2 years - and they tweak the dosage at times. The concentration is a fraction of the other meds because they're delivered directly into the spinal column. He occasionally takes an oxy for breakthrough, but NO other oral opiates.  No addiction.  When he would go to the ER for pain before the pump was installed, he'd be up to 8mg IV dilaudid and it STILL wasn't helping. 

I hope the hospital can help you. Ask your pain management doctor about the Medtronic pump. If you don't have a Pain Management doctor, get one. Your regular oncologist's specialty is not pain management.

My suggestion is to put together advanced medical directives stating what kind of end of life care you desire. 

Speak with palliative care AND hospice they are not the same thing.  Palliative care will help with pain management and comfort care. Hospice will help you make your end of life decisions while also being able to provide 1st hand accounts of what dying with advanced cancer looks like. 

Speak with not just your medical oncologist but also your GP and the radiation oncologist. 

Also you can pick and choose the amount of treatment you want. For example I am stage 4 breast cancer I choose to do 6 rounds of chemo, a unilateral mastectomy and opted Not to have radiation. 

So you could opt to have surgery to ease pain or radiation to bothersome mets to help ease pain and opt not to have chemo. 

I don't regret having chemo and if I was told tomorrow that I needed it again i would do it. It sucked but the worst of the side effects for me were days 1 to 10 then days 10 to 21 I felt good.  

I also do not regret not having radiation. 

The difference between chemo and radiation is that chemo is systemic, it goes through the entire body destroying cancer cells but it can not tell the difference between cancer cells and healthy rapidly growing cells and this is why we tend to lose our hair and experience things like GI issues and mouth sores.  It is basically a carpet bomb for cancer. 

Radiation is a focused targeted treatment that has limitations. It does not treat systemically and once an area has been radiated that area can never be radiated again so it is a one shot type of deal. I just couldn't justify losing 5-10 weeks for a, at the time, preventative measure that wasn't 100% guaranteed.  But I know of people who had really great experiences in pain management when they had bothersome mets radiated. 

Whatever you decision, make sure you are 100% true to you. Also treatment will be an option for only a period of time. You can always start and if it is too much stop. 

If you live in Canada you can look into medical assistance in dying. There are some states in the USA that offers it as well and I do believe some European countries do as well.

Granted, hospice is usually almost completely covered by Medicare, but it is for when you are considered terminal with a life expectancy of 6 months or less.  Palliative care, which is a close relative of hospice, is used in conjunction with traditional medical therapies for serious illness, such as cancer.  A palliative team works with your doctors in oncology and radiology to provide supportive treatment, such as pain management, help at home,  and emotional support to patient and caregiver.  Also, palliative care can be utilized for weeks, months, or years.  If you have traditional medicare it's the 80/20 ratio.  If qualified for Medicaid it should be covered mostly.  Either way, one of the first things you should ask for is a social worker at the hospital.  They know more about what is available, how to qualify, etc.

I've been caregiver to 2 people with cancer.  It can be hell to get them what they need, when they need it.  It can be that way for any serious medical condition.

It happened so fast I didn't have time to process it that much.  My nurses made me feel loved and special.

When I was upstaged I got 2nd opinions, and really clicked with another oncologist so I switched to her.

Eventually she left, my new one is quite empathetic but it was really good to have the other one when I was adjusting to my new reality.

I had a talk with the clinic's head of palliative care about how I could expect to die, and the way she explained it was so much better than I expected (along with seeing how much empathy she brought to her job) had me walk out in a pretty jaunty mood.

throwawayakam,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_fmukd8r,3,fmxr4kr,"Her doctors did not expect much at the beginning. We went to four different oncologists and while none of them said: she will not make it beyond a year, I would hear the words “palliative”, “life-limiting” and the like all the time. All of them, however, did encourage us to go aggressive with treatment because her overall health permitted that. One of them (her current treating physician) mentioned that with oligometastatic lung cancer, they may achieve a long-lasting remission but IF and only if she responds to systemic therapy incredibly well. 

Looking back at her case, I could not but realize that we truly lucked out in the context of the horrible card mom was dealt. Her PDL1- status did not bode well at all. The likelihood of her responding to immunotherapy was in the single digits. The likelihood of her achieving a complete response after just eight infusions was as close to nil as humanely possible. Her doctors did not hide their surprise by the results at all - they flat-out told us that they need to reconvene and reconsider strategy because they very rarely see such a response to systemic therapy. 

So to answer your second question...in retrospect, I do believe that she has now exceeded most doctors’ expectations. The evolution of her case is rare, but with the current ascent of immunotherapy to the frontline of NSCLC treatment, it has become a lot more attainable.

Wyntersun,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_fyac5z,7,fn0d0nh,"First of all I want to say that you’re not being selfish. Cancer just really sucks. It disrupts your life in a major way, and it’s hard for everyone to deal with. It’s normal to feel angry, scared, sad, anxious, or even bitter. It’s NOT fair to be saddled with this awful disease, especially when it hits you so early in life.

Our stories have some similarities, so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps even a little bit. 

I was 29 when I got my diagnosis, too (stage IV lung cancer). By that time, it had spread to my liver, spine/right hip, and brain. The oncologist apologetically told me that I was too far gone to be cured, and that the best they could offer me was palliative treatment. 

I agreed to it because I had a lot of things left on my bucket list and I wanted to live long enough to see my favorite hockey team win the Stanley Cup. I got radiation therapy on my lung, lumbar spine, and brain (the side effects were horrible but it was worth it to be able to walk on my own again). I’m on my third line of treatment because the first two drugs we tried didn’t keep the remaining tumors from growing. My cancer’s not gone (yet!), but at least it’s not spreading. 

When I was diagnosed, they told me that patients with brain mets live, on average, six months. I’ve been alive for six years (and counting!). My advice to you: stay positive and try to find the silver lining as much as possible. Give yourself things to look forward to. Think often about all the people who support you and are in your corner, rooting for you, and bask in that wonderful feeling of knowing you’re loved. Hope for the best and you might just get it.

Hormone therapy is always the first line for metastatic prostate cancer and inside the last ten years the Taxotere chemo which is likely what was delayed is the next step in aggressive therapy to kill the ""castrate resistant"" cancer. Aggressive treatment often continues after the Taxotere with Zytiga (Abiraterone), an oral chemo to further suppress testosterone and shut down adrenal glands to somehow magically keep cancer cells from producing their own food. Other drugs like Xtandi and Jevtana you might hear about as well. If the mets can be counted then radiation can be effective. The new treatment showing some promise in trials involves some freaky seek &amp; destroy immunology--it's Lutetium 177--already a therapeutic option in Germany and Australia. Maybe UK, soon.

In fact, data shows that it can possibly even increase time left because of symptom mgmt and all that is included. If options change and active treatment is available he could pursue the active treatment and forgo hospice care. The patient always has that right. 

Does anyone provide palliative care where you are located? That might be an option for him. Or maybe another meeting (via phone or video conference even) with oncologist to firmly lay it out in black/white what his options are/are not. Or a second opinion? 

There is a process and acceptance the patient has to go through as they go through the end of the disease process and only time and the disease exacerbation can help them understand that.

BoomerKeith,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_gcabg0,4,fpaj0tx,"Looks like there's a lot of good answers already here.  Uncontrolled growth is probably the simplest term.  When my mom was diagnosed with CNS Lymphoma, she had 2 tumors in her brain.  As the tumors grew they began to shut off essential functions of the brain that eventually caused organ failure/death.  


Chemo/Radio therapy essentially targets that growth and attempts to reduce the size.  Some people/types of cancer respond very well to therapy while others don't.  My mom was 74 but in excellent health otherwise.  Since she was older, and the type of cancer she had rapidly reproducing, there was no real treatment option.  At that point it was about palliative care.  


The fact that you've gone two years without reappearance is AWESOME.  It really sucks that the treatment caused other issues, but you did kick cancer's ass!",t3_gcabg0,,2020-05-02 19:52:57,/r/cancer/comments/gcabg0/how_does_cancer_actually_kill/fpaj0tx/,r/cancer,How does cancer actually kill?,"I'm in remission from stage 3 uterine cancer.

The tumor never physically bothered me, I almost regret getting diagnosed because a hysterectomy wasn't enough. I HAD to get chemo or the ""cancer will come back"". Really?

Oncology doctors are still working from home and can provide prescriptions. Many late stage patients have aches and pains that may seem unexplainable but the cancer is usually the root cause. Mention it to the team.

Most good teams will explain how palliative care strategies can improve the quality of your mother’s life. I definitely know that good pain management is treated as priority for patients who are late stage, so please look into it. 

There is often resistance to palliative care, even for patients who are not at late stage- sadly it doesn’t mean you have any more time with her, but the time she has will be spent comfortably. At stage IV, the priority isn’t to make her do challenging chemo her body might not be able to handle but instead to allow her quality of life. Hopefully she handles her chemo alright - it’s important to keep taking anti sickness pills around the clock- some patients have more than one type of anti nausea pill to provide extra cover.",t3_gcftcc,,2020-05-03 00:20:32,/r/cancer/comments/gcftcc/choice_in_treatment/fpb9vcy/,r/cancer,Choice in treatment,"Hey all. 2 brief questions.

The last few weeks he has been eating alot less and 2 weeks of jaundice which has now worsened further. He's spending alot more time sleeping but up until today has been getting up on his own. He has also been getting confused and l his memory. And also been getting weaker. 

Now I ask - he seems to now have swelling in his ankles and hands? This has made him unsteady also which doesn't help when he is now feeling weaker.

His urine has also gone nearly black? 

Does anyone have any experiences with this? From what I've read online it just says about it being an advanced cancer symptom etc "
Oran0s,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_gdodas,2,fpj58l8,"First and foremost everything you're experiencing is normal. The mix of emotions that come in waves, assaulting your train of thought with each ebb and flow, is heart wrenching and aggravating. But is an experience everyone goes through.

1.) It sounds like your dad's disease is progressing, but maybe not depending on what treatment he has had recently. Radiation necrosis/inflammation can cause some similar symptoms to disease progression, but timing and imaging can sort that out. I'm sure you've already maximized treatment options, but be sure to speak with your dad's oncologist about his symptoms and if any adjustment to his supportive medications like steroids or inclusion of avastin may help. And speak to them as to whether there are any trials he might still be eligible for (this window might be narrowing as his functional status wanes, unfortunately). I'd particularly focus your efforts on any new oncolytic viruses or CAR-T cell trials in the area.

2.) The steroids he has likely been on will make any prior conditions like diabetes flourish and his weight gain. While it sounds like he had some prior conditions, realize both the cancer absorbing a bulk of his body's nutrients and his treatments have taken their toll. Encourage him to do what he can, but realize it may not be as much as you want or hope. Try things like foot pedals and the like he could do while sitting.

3.) Caregiver fatigue is real and unrecognized. When you chat with your dad's oncologist let them know what your experiencing. If they're worth their weight they have had many family members come to them feeling the same. Many academic programs offer comprehensive cancer support programs with social workers and case managers to help families cope. Our hospital has dedicated therapists and psychiatrists trained on working with adolescents or children. There's a wealth of resources out there. If the oncologist isn't helpful go online to GBM support groups or philanthropic foundations and they likely have some dedicated information for caregivers in need of help or support.

4.) Enjoy your time with your Dad now. If he liked to barbecue, fire up the grill and wheel him out. If he enjoyed telling stories, maybe have an evening where you guys reminisce over prior trips or vacations. You might have to do most of the talking but I'm sure he'll chime in when he can. Try to be in the moment with him as much as possible and I'd encourage you when you have the strength to have the hard conversations with him. Let him know how you're feeling and how much you care. You can find some online tools for legacy planning which can be helpful here for you and him. Social workers and therapists should be able to help here. 


5.) Most important** please make sure your dad is plugged into a palliative care specialist. Usually they can work alongside your oncologist, having them aboard doesn't mean you're giving up. They are the trained nexus with whom you need right now.**",t3_gdodas,,2020-05-05 05:36:11,/r/cancer/comments/gdodas/trying_to_cope_with_my_dads_brain_cancer/fpj58l8/,r/cancer,"Trying to cope with my dad’s brain cancer diagnosis I feel has made me a worse person, and I don’t know what to do",[deleted]

* much older cancer patients - have lived their life but not ready to die yet
* cancer patients with kids - the guilt of wrecking their lives
* stage 1 patients - who have really good odds
* stage 2/3 patients - dealing with so much fear and uncertainty
* stage 4 patients - incurable but treatment is working
* palliative care patients - all about comfort rather than cure.

Let me start by saying that this post is in no way a reflection on this community. I've just recently discovered it, and I love the shared positivity and support that I've seen on various posts and comments.

I'm 23 years old, and was diagnosed with a grade 2 astrocytoma back in December. I've had a shunt put in, and spent six weeks on radiotherapy and chemo in pill form. I'm now on a treatment where I'll be on chemo for a week for six months, with MRIs every few months to assess how the tumour is (hopefully) shrinking. I'm currently on dexamethasone, a steroid which has caused weight gain and sleep disruption. I've also developed a tremor in my right hand, and the right side of my jaw seems to have stiffened up, almost like local anesthesia has been permanently injected. My eyesight has also been affected, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing what physical impediments the future may hold.

I come onto this sub and I've seen a huge outpour of love and support. It's fantastic, and I've been poring over posts old and new. The ""problem"", that is so insignificant that I hesitate to even call it that, is that everything for me is so long term. My doctors can't tell me whether I have 20 years or 60 ahead of me. So when I see people posting about their diagnosis of a few months, or the sudden decline of their loved ones from healthy to dying in a short time span, I can't help but feel... inadequate? I don't mean to make it a competition, but my issues seem so removed from what I see on this sub. I mean, how can I complain when people are being faced with their own very real mortalities? When they're making memorial posts about their loved ones, while I'll be here for decades? I feel like I have a disconnect from most of the content here, especially when my current symptoms are so minor compared to what I see on here.

Anyways, this has become more of a rant than I meant it to be, and I apologize for that. If anyone has a similar experience, I would love to hear about it, and for anyone else, thanks for taking the time to read it. Shout out again to this great community."

I recently lost my dad to stage IV NSCLC (he was diagnosed after taking him to the ER for severe back pain). The cancer had not metastasized to any organs based on his first scans, but there was a spine met that was causing the majority of his pain. A combination of opioids quickly got the pain under control for him, thanks to the palliative care team. Your mom should definitely be discussing the abdominal spasms with her care team to find out why that's happening. Once you know more, please get your mom a consultation with palliative care even if it can only be done via a video meeting.

If your mom does have bone metastases, it could be a source of great pain as bone pain is notoriously difficult to treat. However, I will tell you that once they got my father's pain under control, it remained that way until he passed away (of course, adjustments were made as the cancer progressed). Tell her not to be afraid to let them know if the pain meds aren't working, as they're processed by individuals differently (for example, my father didn't get much relief from the fentanyl patch in increasingly larger doses so they switched him to MS Contin).

Those spams usually occur later in the day or at night, and she can't do anything but walk around in pain and cry. It's so painful to watch, and I keep worrying that she won't lose to cancer, but to the pain. Meds don't really work anymore. She has almost tried them all.

Could the cause of the pain be her metastases? Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is there a chance the pain will get more bearable as her metastases are affected by her therapy? Or is chemo and immunotherapy going to lead to even more pain?"

**Background**

My mum has an incurable form of cancer. We are on the last chemo drug with a low response rate. The oncologists has said that other options are unlikely to be effective. It is VERY obvious that the current one isn't working (visible tumors still growing). I heard my mum expressing to her friends that this is like issuing a death sentence to her and she is just waiting for death. She has some glimmer of hope that maybe if we see another oncologist for a second opinion, there could be a solution. I browsed the medical literature online - there is simply no cure for this so even if somehow another drug can be used, it will merely prolong her live (and not cure the cancer).

We discussed stem cell transplant with the oncologist who said that it would not work on my mum because the cancer is not even under control + the high mortality risk associated with such a procedure.

**Question**

At some point, whatever hope my mother has would disappear. Was wondering if you all have thoughts on how I can soften the blow?

I have read threads on this subreddit where upon being told that chemo no longer works, a patient just loses all hope and deteriorates rapidly (can't find that post but it will always stay at the back of my mind).

I have tried introducing the possibility that nothing will work by saying the following:

* ""even if there are no treatment options, that will not be the end, they will continue to treat your symptoms to make sure you are well taken care of""
* I have also began introducing the term ""palliative doctors"" and encouraging her to think about what she wants ""more chemo + poor quality of life or no further treatment + managing symptoms"".

So far she seems to have taken them well but what just unsettles me is when she said ""at least I am still undergoing chemo"" which indicates to me that she is still clinging on to some hope that it may work.

Thank you for reading my post."

 - Needle aspiration
 - Biopsy 
 - MRI scan
 - PET scan
 - Wisdom tooth removed(optional)
 - One failed PEG tube placement

Lots of misc medical appointments.  
Dont let all the procedures scare your FIL.  Most weren't bad. Biopsy wasn't fun but tolerable.  I resumed work too soon after procedures as I didn't ask enough questions about recovery expectations.

Stopped working because the appointments were interfering.  

Every person is different in appointments and reactions.   

The mental progression is real. I went through disbelief, slow acceptance, wondering where I went wrong, not doing treatments(eg dying/palliative care),  finally acceptance.  All while moving forward not knowing what I really wanted.  Yesterday while doing chemo I finally flipped to wanting to live.

I have been in post-secondary education &amp; training for almost twenty years, and have four total degrees.

Radiation oncologists treat a huge number of different types of cancers, usually in a multi-disciplinary setting with both surgeons and medical oncologists on our teams. 

Some radiation treatments are pretty easy to get through, some are VERY hard. Radiation can also be used to treat/prevent non-cancerous conditions too, including pain, inflammation, organ-rejection, movement disorders, keloids, dupuytren's contractures, etc.

The radiation oncologist's job is to know when radiation is or is not appropriate for a patient, how much to give, how to break it up so that it's given safely but still effectively on the tumor, whether it's safe to give with chemo, where to target, how to deliver it, and how to manage the side effects of radiation, both short &amp; long term.

We have to understand the physics of radiation, the biology of how radiation interacts with human tissue, the math of probability of controlling a population of tumor cells with given treatments, how to administer radiation safely without causing risk to our staff members, as well as how to design, interpret, and apply clinical trials to best help our patients fight their cancers.

We could not do what we do without a diverse staff, including nurses (like u/mariodejaniero), medical physicists, dosimetrists, radiation therapists, and the technicians who keep our multi-million dollar machines running.

Ask me (almost) anything.

In brief, we generally need someone to be healthy enough to walk into clinic for us to treat them with chemo. Not a rule but a good yardstick for how functional you are. 

What's making her have these symptoms? Probably a combination of rapidly progressing disease gobbling up any energy she has and causing more discomfort, increased painkillers to help with pain which can result in even more fatigue, blunted appetite, and confusion. Cancer is an energy sink, in order to divide as quickly and as unabashedly as it does, it requires huge amounts of nutrition that would be going to the rest of her body. As she's not eating, it's only making this worse.

Some of this might get better with treatment, particularly if she is treatment naive (hasn't had any yet). But it sounds like the window to treat her at all is closing quick. If this were any other country than America, she'd be having a conversation about quality of life and likely transitioning to hospice. We tend to be more aggressive, both patients and physicians. Which could be argued leads to more prolonged suffering. 

Having said all that, you should call her oncologist and update with your concerns. That should prompt them to expedite seeing her and managing not only her symptoms (pain, fatigue, appetite) but developing/re-evaluating treatment plan. She should be plugged into a palliative care physician as well.

I came out to see her with my kids before chemo starts so they could get some final good memories in with her.
In the week since I’ve been here she’s declined rapidly. 

- She doesn’t want to eat. She’s also diabetic and her sugar crashed earlier this week which resulted in a fall.
- She’s having a really difficult time remembering. I.e. I’ll give her meds and two minutes later she’ll tell me she needs her medication. All medications including pain killers are kept from her to prevent missing/doubling doses.
- Her mood swings are getting worse. She’s usually mild mannered and polite and now she’s snapping if you ask her to clarifying what she asks...even though her questions/requests don’t make sense. 
- She’s exhausted. All she wants to do is sleep. I’ve been waking her to monitor blood sugar and feed her. 
- Her pain has increased and her pain killers are no longer helping. She has an appointment for pain therapy but it’s two weeks away. 
- Her mobility has decreased. At the beginning of the week she could walk with her cane. Then a few days later the walker. Now it’s a marathon to get her from bed to wheelchair. Problems moving began happening before she fell.

With regards to her imaging, PET scans use tagged glucose to highlight areas of the body which are metabolically active. This is often cancer, but any sites which heavily use glucose will light up. This includes the brain and as such PET scans don't give you very much information on what's happening up there. A dedicated MRI or CT scan (if she can't get an MRI) is appropriate if she is having new neurologic symptoms in the context of metastatic lung cancer. Should she have cancer that spread there, targeted or whole brain radiation may be options. Not suggesting she does, but it's an appropriate tool depending on her symptoms and her oncologist would be the best one to assess her and make that call.

I would also encourage you not to wait if you're really worried about her or if you have a question.

Give yourself some slack. your worth it. Talk to an oncologist. If you choose no treatment, the doc can tell you what is most likely to happen. Many cancers are curable. It may be curable now, waiting may make that impossible.

in my bladder.
I'll admit to being scared.
But the thing is I have no friends,
no family.

No one that cares about me, no one to love or that loves me. I've accepted the road I'm on and I dont care.

I'm planning on letting it run its course
So I guess what I'm asking is
how bad is it going to get ?

I'm sure it's going to hurt. 
But is there anything I can do to ease some of the pain ?  And will it be fast or will I linger?

Any help will be appreciated
Thank you"
EverydayiEW,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_h04ily,3,ftksgmy,Sending you big hugs. I’m so sorry your best friend has been through all of this and that you have to watch it all happen. There are pros and cons to home versus hospital palliative care; in 2018-19 I dealt with both when my 14 year old daughter had the dreaded cancer. She wanted to be home and was in the end but in the middle had hospital care which was respite for me. Home was best cuz of our animals and there were less interruptions to our day. Hospital was good cuz  I didn’t have to deal with meals but I stayed with her and I don’t know that that’s an option for you. In both situations we slept in the same room which gave us both comfort. I wish I could help you more. Take care of you too honey!,t3_h04ily,,2020-06-10 12:01:17,/r/cancer/comments/h04ily/why_cant_moms_live_forever/ftksgmy/,r/cancer,Why can’t moms live forever?,"I’m struggling really bad and I don’t know where else to turn to so I’m just going to ramble here. 
It’s just my mom and I. All of her sisters and brothers are back in our country and I have no siblings either. My mom has been through so much in her life. She experienced life in a war torn country while pregnant and having to escape. She came to Canada with a child on her own and worked so fucking hard as a single parent to do everything to make my life amazing. She put me through university and gave me so much love and wonderful memories. She bought me my first car with no credit and anything at all that I wished for she made happen. She’s so gentle and sweet and so patient and kind. She made the most delicious food. She would listen and care about anything I had to say. I could complain about something for hours and she would just make me feel better and never get annoyed. She would cut up fruit and make me plate of snacks and bring to my room while I was studying. It breaks my heart that I spent so much time cooped up studying instead of more time hanging out with my mom while she’s healthy and well. I hate this feeling. 

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last May. She was doing so well and had so much energy. She was getting chemotherapy and would come home after and make food or we would go for a walk. It was so amazing to see her thriving. However, they found out that as the cancer was shrinking everywhere else it was getting larger on her ovaries. They then had to stop chemotherapy for a month and do a surgery to remove her ovaries. While at the hospital she developed pneumonia and that made healing difficult. She then got discharged after but still felt so much pain in her abdomen. She spent a whole month in bed thinking it’s the healing process but she literally couldn’t sit without feeling pain. Even after telling her oncologist she’s feeling so much pain and isn’t ready for chemotherapy they did nothing and said to keep resting. At her next appointment she continued to tell her she’s not feeling good so they do CT scan and find out she has an abscess so they had to do drainage this continued to make it so she could not receive chemo for so long and that was not good. Her fingers and feet also developed neuropathy and so they had to switch the chemo. 

She began to feel nauseous and puked a few times after eating so I brought her to the hospital and had to be admitted again for them to find out she has an obstruction. She was able to recover from the obstruction on her own and was sent home feeling good. Unfortunately that lasted 5 days and the symptoms returned and she had to go back again and has been there for over a month. They had to do one surgery to get around the obstruction but that surgery failed and ended up causing an infection due to leakage. Her blood pressure decreased drastically and heart rate increased. It was so scary. They had to redo the surgery and she spent days in the ICU. The worst and most heartbreaking thing is having a doctor FaceTime you to talk about the “next steps” saying if the ostomy doesn’t start working on its own there is nothing left they can do. Thankfully it began to work, however her feet and legs up to her knees have swelled up so much after the surgery that she is literally not able to lift her feet get up on her own without the help of two other people. 

She’s very upset because she is so used to being independent and doing everything on her own. She’s bed ridden and it’s so hard to watch. She has lost a lot of weight and I’m devastated seeing her this way. They are now talking about palliative care and moving her to a hospital that offers that or to bring her home and have home care constantly coming. I don’t know what’s worse. I’m just so torn and feel like my life is completely falling apart and everyone else is moving along. I don’t want to live a life where my mom isn’t here. She won’t be able to meet her grandchildren or see me get my career started. She’s my best friend and I truly don’t feel like I can go on without her."

balkanista,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_hbmv8h,2,fv9xu87,"I can really relate to your post. My father also was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-small cell adenocarcinoma of the lung. He also had to get a second biopsy after they didn't collect enough tissue in the first attempt. And he had a pleural effusion that was drained. 

He started on Opdivo (immunotherapy drug) first while regaining his strength after experiencing an ileus (lack of movement in the intestines due to all the painkillers for the bone met in his spine). Once he regained strength 2 weeks later, chemo was added to his treatment plan (CarboTaxol). He also had 10 palliative sessions of radiation. Unfortunately, nothing helped stop the progression and he went on hospice to pass peacefully just 9 weeks after diagnosis.

The chemo was very hard on him even though the oncologist said once weekly CarboTaxol is generally well-tolerated. He was actually relieved to stop the chemo. Now, everyone tolerates chemo differently but it just wasn't for my dad – he slept nonstop and lost 10 pounds in just 3 days. The immunotherapy drug made him pretty tired and achy, but he did tolerate the Opdivo better than the chemo.

We learned a lot during my father's journey, and one thing I recommend to anyone dealing with NSCLC is to really dig into the molecular profile of the tumor. For instance, I wished we knew earlier that my dad's tumor had a very unfavorable co-mutation (KRAS and STK-11) which is considered virtually undruggable with its extremely low response to treatment. We didn't find out about the tumor co-mutation until he had the liquid biopsy (Guardant 360 test) after we learned the first biopsy was inadequate. It seems oncologists focus on favorable or targetable mutations, but are reticent to divulge details about unfavorable mutations (I get it; relentless optimism is part of the job). That was our experience, anyway.

Everyone feels differently about treatment no matter the prognosis. If your dad is intent on fighting, I think the best thing is to support him 100% no matter his decision. And he may have a remarkable response to Keytruda! In my dad's case, the oncologist recommended he stop treatment to preserve quality of life and my father and all of us were on board. It was still an extremely somber and sad moment for us to hear that the cancer was behaving so aggressively and we had limited time, but hospice (and all of us) made sure he was comfortable those last few weeks.

I hope that your dad's treatments are well tolerated, that the cancer is arrested in its progression, and that you get much more precious time with your father! Btw, CBD and medical marijuana greatly helped my father with his appetite. Fathers are so special and it's so hard to watch an extremely fit and youthful person decline rapidly (my dad was a quite fit and youthful 75-year-old when he passed in late-April).",t3_hbmv8h,,2020-06-18 21:55:59,/r/cancer/comments/hbmv8h/dad_diagnosed_with_stage_4_adenocarcinoma_of_the/fv9xu87/,r/cancer,Dad diagnosed with Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma of the lung. I could use a little support and have a few questions.,"My father is 83 years old and was diagnosed in April with Stage 4 non small cell adenocarcinoma of the lung.  He is (was) an extremely fit and youthful 83 year old.  He is an avid golfer who has competed and won the gold medal in the US Senior Games.  It’s crazy how much a few months can change things!

He received his first round of chemo on 21 May 20.  On 5 June 20 he had a second biopsy (did not get enough cells the first time to do all of the testing) and a plueradesis (he has a malignant pleural effusion).  All of this has really taken a toll on him and it is crazy how much he’s declined in just three weeks when I saw him last.  He is visibly thinner and very pale.  He is incredibly fatigued and has very little appetite. (Blood levels were ok ... I was hoping he was just anemic)

His PDL1 level came back at 3% and they are planning on adding Keytruda to his next chemo on 25 June 20 (Carboplatin + Alimta).  I am so worried that he won’t be able to tolerate this.  The oncologist is already delaying his chemo by a week to allow him to eat more and up his activity.   She told him if he doesn’t, he cannot get chemo.  This scared the crap out of him and he is forcing himself to eat, do his exercises and go for short walks.  It takes everything he has to do those things and I can tell that it is very difficult for him.  He is a retired military pilot so he has that Type A personality and he guts it out.

I’m just not sure he should be going through with more chemo.  Now they are adding Keytruda and it has a lot of immune side effects.  It seems like his immune system is already in overdrive fighting the cancer ... he’s been having horrible sweats and intermittent fevers/chills since this all began.  

They oncologist briefly spoke about hospice and he shot her down in seconds flat.  He is 100% determined to get the chemo and he is completely competent so there is nothing I can do.  I am very scared for his future.  

So, my long winded post is to see if there is anyone out there who has gone through a similar experience.  Were you or your loved one not looking great but then the chemo “kicked in” and you/they started to improve?  Or, conversely, did you/ your loved one get more chemo after not looking great and declined further?

I am a medical professional who has worked oncology and hospice so I feel like maybe I am feeding my dad to the wolves.  It’s really hard.  Any advice/thoughts/reassurance anyone could give would be really appreciated :-)"
Hotdog_jingle,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_hbxkwr,3,fvc4t1m,"Hello,

I’m sorry you’re going through this and your mother is having such extreme pain and discomfort. I’m stage IV renal cell with lung mets, completed the 4 induction cycles of Opdivo/Yervoy (ipi/nivo) and now take Opdivo once a month. It has worked wonders for me, has caused some colitis, but that’s manageable. It’s a potent drug combo, especially in tandem with possibly Cabozantinib. Cabo is usually heralded as the best drug for bone mets, but it sounds like her system is rightfully overwhelmed. The fact that she had the radiation to fire things up then the immunotherapy could create an abscopal effect, which is a good thing...basically alerting the immunotherapy where to attack. request a palliative care consult, not hospice. Palliative specializes in symptom management, particularly pain and nausea and would be a fantastic asset going forward-especially to find a workaround on the opioid sensitivity and get back in control. I’m in touch with several people utilizing palliative care online with RCC who are living past expectations, so it doesn’t mean throwing in the towel. You never want to take steroids lightly with ipi/nivo as it can decrease efficacy, but sometimes that’s the cure to all of this. The eye drooping and decrease in mobility is a concern, but hopefully scans are negative. Also ipi/nivo can be put on hold for a bit and restarted or she could start nivo alone as ipi tends to be the much harsher of the two. These are just my thoughts, I hope she gets a thorough work up, feels better and stable and gets back on a treatment regimen whatever that might be. Also, there are many people who are absolutely ravaged by immunotherapy after one or two treatments, go off it, then go on to see the benefits down the line some even having durable responses, the immune system is a hell of a fighter. First and foremost try palliative care consult, I’m really feeling for you guys, it’s scary and miserable, but you’ve got people that care. Please keep me updated friend. Best of luck.

Also I plug this every time. Join Smart Partients kidney cancer forum. I’ve learned so much there and have found specialists, support and downright lifesaving info and there are experienced people far exceeding what I can offer you. Good luck friend!",t3_hbxkwr,,2020-06-19 13:43:12,/r/cancer/comments/hbxkwr/for_those_that_have_had_immunotherapy_treatment/fvc4t1m/,r/cancer,For those that have had immunotherapy treatment,"Please tell me things get better. Mum has stage IV RCC with mets to her pubic bone / hip joint. She had radiation to the pubic bone (which was symptomatic and the reason she got diagnosed), as well as radiation to the hip joint (where the upper leg meets the hip). This had zero symptoms, until after radiation. There’s bony destruction now and that tumour has grown, causing agonising pain.

Her pain is challenging to address because she doesn’t tolerate opioids well at all. She’s tried a range of different types and most make her sick. She also still has pain, but now feels sick on top of that. She was admitted to the cancer hospital for 10 days while they played around with meds, and came out on a range of meds, from zyprexa, to Jurnista, abstral as needed prior to movement, maxolon, ondansetron. 

She is also having opdivo/yervoy every 3 weeks - has done 2 of 4 cycles. She has started itching terribly all over. She is having orange bowel movements. Also taking Cabozantinib (or placebo).

Pain management nurse said that the nausea might be because she’s in pain, so triple the Abstral dose. She did as instructed today, then ended up in the emergency department because she felt like she was going to faint and felt very sick. She has a droopy left eye and they’ve sent her for scans of her hip, chest and head. The hip lesion looks worse but we understand that is likely pseudoprogession. She’s still at hospital now and will be admitted. She still feels sick and they gave her fluids and dissolvable ondansetron (despite the hospital being made aware by Dad that the IV ondansetron works better for her).

Looking at all of the medications she is taking, they have major interactions with each other! Just feeling like nobody has a damn clue what is going on. They tell you all the symptoms to watch out for, then when they appear, the doctors seem baffled as to what’s causing it. She has a very poor quality of life right now when the oncologist said that her cancer is manageable because the Mets are only in the bone and not other organs. 3 months ago she walked into radiation treatments, now she is in a wheelchair for outside of the house because walking hurts that joint too much.

Just looking for a glimmer of hope that the immunotherapy may just knock her around, but she will eventually feel good again and have more good days than bad. I know this wasn’t meant to be easy, but did not expect her to suffer so terribly. Please share your experiences."
Carliebeans,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_fvc4t1m,1,fvdkaqw,"Thank you so much for your response and support! It really means a lot.

The palliative care team have been involved since Mum’s first stay in hospital. It was they who worked out the cocktail of meds, and we went to a consult with the palliative care physician last week. He was lovely and had all the time in the world. But, given that every other pain medicine has already been tried, the options are limited. He also showed us the scan in the area where it hurts so much; the bone lining in the hip joint is non-existent. 

After 12 hours in the emergency ward last night, she was *finally* transferred to the cancer ward. And then they were needing her Cabo, so I got to take it there and visit with her late last night. Didn’t want to leave her :(

The onc registrar thinks her nausea is definitely due to the pain medication and said they need to get on top of it. They were talking about doing a lumbar puncture, but instead will keep an eye on the drooping. I did some research and found that an overactive immune system can cause demyelination. I pray that is not what is happening. When I saw her last night, her eyes looked okay to me, there wasn’t anything obvious, but she was lying down. Still feeling sick, still no IV nausea meds given, just tablets.

cancerkidette,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_hfu3yi,9,fw088t5,"First of all- trust your doctor. If they have said she has x time to live, it means that she has reached a stage where the cancer is no longer curable, and eventually (not necessarily in 6 months) it will kill her. I’m sorry this happened, but it’s a fact that needs to be accepted. Blind optimism that means that she does not have access to medical care, or the pursuit of further treatment (which would not cure her) will only hurt her far more.

Secondly- DO NOT put her on a vegetable only diet or do anything that your doctors do not tell you to. That is (and I am sorry to be harsh) a terrible and ignorant idea - following “juicing diets” eating this or that will never help her medically and will only quicken her decline. She needs nutrition and she should eat whatever she wants. What she eats or drinks will have no impact on her prognosis. Do not be tempted by scams or by “natural cures”.

Before you read please understand I am not the best with medical terminology. I'm 25 years old.

**(Her Story)** My mom is 62 Years old and has had colon cancer since early 2014. The first cancer had spread to her abdominal cavity and in the limonoids and was considered at stage three. Before they could even remove the tumor she had to do the radiation and the chemo., she was so sick during all of this.

In march or April 2015 the radiation had shrunk the tumor and removed the cancer from her belly.

For the second cancer one we thought it was a UTI and for women its very painful. The cancer had came back, but initially was causing her pain there was a abscess in her perineum. When they did a colonoscopy they didn’t even see it! At the end of the CT scan they missed it, and for the abscess they saw the cancer had returned.

They first had to get the sist cleared up and this is in June 2017. When she has the surgery they noticed the sist had spread to her pelvic area and tried to clean it all up and flush it out.  Thankfully this time the cancer was a stage two B and it had not spread into the lymph nodes.

She now has a permanent colostomy bag, this had to be done because there wasn’t enough healthy tissue attached in her body. Because it had occurred the doctor had got rid of her lower half of her colon , and after the food passes through the intestine it then goes in the bag.

Then she was recommended to something called ""Cyber Knife"" in 2019 which is something in Austin, Texas. It didn't work out to well and unfortunately she was diagnosed with Stage Four ovarian cancer and it has spread to her liver and lungs. The last couple of treatments with Chemo have really impacted her weight and caused her to throw up quite a bit after eating.

The latest test that came back last week (June 17th, 2020) one of her doctors mentioned her cancer percentage went down from 21 percent to 15 percent. I'm not really to sure what that is but it sounds amazing! One of her doctors today (June 25th, 2020) in Temple, Texas mentioned she has six months to live and it completely made her crumble, so I mentioned to her to just hold her head high and tell her how much of a great son she raised. Just to uplift her spirit and I told her how strong she has been during all this ...

**(My Questions)** When a doctor tells someone that statement, is it typically something ideal and there's nothing that can be done? She's lost a lot of weight and stopped throwing up which is great. But I just want to see if there's something I can do. By maybe putting her on a vegetable only diet to help or something natural to help? I've heard of holistic treatment I don't know if that's even a thing either. (I'm very optimistic and hate to see my mom cry).

**(Me Just Typing)** All in all I grew up without a dad and my mom was the type to give me so much when I was young and she sacrificed everything to give me what I have today. She worked overtime every week as a dental assistant from the age I was born and stopped working when she first was diagnosed with Cancer. I was awarded one pair of new shoes every year for school when I was in grade school and they lasted me all year. She taught me about hard work and not to take things for granted. To always give more than take and to be grateful in what you have in life. I'm sorry if I'm rambling she just was great and doesn't deserve Cancer, she's not the type to be diagnosed with it and really no one is, Cancer just really does suck. Honestly I don't even know if I should tell other people about her having a life expectancy of six months. Because I don't want people to look at my mom like she's not a fighter and can't prove the doctor wrong.

If you read this far or reading this sentence, thank you. Thank you for showing interest in reading my mom's story.

Honestly what hurt the most out of this situation. Is during this Covid-19 outbreak hospitals in my area aren't allowing immediate family or anyone that doesn't have an appointment inside. So I'm sitting in the parking lot and I have her tell me. She heard this bad news and she was alone when she heard it. I honestly am just lost for words ..."

My poor best friend of 18 years is only 30 and was told last year she had one year to live, stage 4 cancer. She was very fit, healthy, did a heck of a lot more diet and exercise than me. Diagnosis came very suddenly after the birth of her baby. She barely had symptoms. She has two babies and her husband. 

She felt and looked fine. Then tried platinum chemo and none of it worked, around the 5th cycle she started to become very weak. Her doctor then told her to continue to cycle 7. She did this and she really went down hill and became poorly. Since this didn't work she would have no other options and now was palliative. She could not accept this and neither could we.

We did crowdfunding and the nhs hospital agreed to try immunotherapy on a private basis based on research and the therapy working in her type of cancer. She had her second cycle of immunotherapy a few weeks ago and it's honestly like it's destroying her :(. 

She is in absolute agony, screaming pain. She can't get out of bed, can't look after the kids and is only awake maybe 3 hours per day. Thankfully her family have her, the kids and husband staying with them for care and support  She is barely eating as she has no appetite, wasting away. She has tried everything from opiates, tramadol, ketamine, gabapentin to the traditional aspirin, ibuprofen and tramadol! Nothing is working :(. She can barely move it is just so hard to watch. I have a gut feeling that this is all really bad signs and that we are losing her. Her family are still saying the therapy will work etc but i'm just not sure anymore. 

Does anyone have any positive, hopeful stories? I know everyone's journey is unique but even just some words of wisdom."

pokey_reddirtgirl,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ho6yu2,2,fxi2e9a,"Hospice nurse here. Unfortunately, most lung cancer is diagnosed after it's well advanced. The drugs are getting better so people can live longer, but that's no help when she's too ill to take them. The sooner we can get to you, the better. As far as choosing a company, ask around, the doctor or hospital is not supposed to just set you up with the one they are medical director at or own. You can choose any company as long as they accept your payor source and there are companies that will provide charitable care for those without insurance. In my experience, there doesn't seem to be a difference in care between for-profit and not-for-profit. You will have a team to help you with an experienced RN available 24/7/365 to deal with problems. The goal is comfort, and sometimes once people get their pain controlled and start preparing to die, they actually end up living longer because of the decreased stress. She could possibly improve enough that maybe chemo or radiation could be considered, and then we'd just discharge her from hospice and bw available if she needs us again in the future. The hospice pays for all the medications that are for palliative symptoms (pain, anxiety, difficulty breathing, etc) and for medications that are related to the hospice diagnosis. So if she's taking inhalers or singular or on oxygen, they'll provide those and any durable medical equipment (hospital bed, wheelchair, shower bench, etc,) all with no out of pocket for the patient. I'm so sorry you're facing this.

My mother has brain cancer, that one that new tumors appears quickly, so now she are half blinded, can't see for the sides of her vision, ( panoramic vision ), and have a constant ""headache"" without pain but a feeling like she is drunk.

Now, with a new tumor detected in November and intervened in January with radiosurgery, she presented now new symptoms which are that her left side, the one she has worst ( she can see more with her right side but totally blinded on her left side),is totally without strength, weak, she can't move very well her left hand and her left leg, she can't walk too much for her own.

With all the covid situation, we didn't know yet what is happening in her head, sanity has been collapsed so resonance it's not be done ( they called us to do the resonance the 22th of this month), but until 3 or 4 from August we won't know anything.

So, why I need help? Well, it's for the weakness in his leg and her hand, my brother and I work almost the whole day, and she is alone until we back home at 18pm, so we are afraid that she fell off and hurt her self fataly. My question is.. We are searching for something wearable like a band, with a simple button or very simple function, that in the case she fell off and no one of us is with her, she can call us just by pressing that button, because she don't always have her phone with her.

I am on very strong painkillers i'm under palliative care but its the break through pain thats problematic. I have 13 tumours throughout my liver and they rub and push on my ribs and diaphragm. I've also had 90% of my stomach removed and eating is v.painful. Its just a balancing act of being ill so long my painkillers have gone up and up as your body gets used to them and of not wanting to sleep all the time or have a fuzzy head i hate that. 

I didnt mean anything bad by second hand chemo I'm incredibly grateful for them. 

I have been on 3 drugs over the 18 years. When I was first diagnosed there was only 1 drug that had just come out and I got it on compassionate use that I had for 3 years before it stopped working. By then another drug was found to work and was in a trial which I went on but that made me super sick and I only tolerated it for a year and half. Because there were no other options I then went back to the first one which worked again for two years and its kind of been like that hopping between 3 different drugs until they stop working but I'm so lucky they have got me this far.

I'm sorry if I sound ungrateful I'm honestly just tired at this point its been a long time and because my health has been so bad and maybe because of the trials other things are starting to go wrong too so I guess I'm just down about it all at the moment.",t3_hqx80w,,2020-07-14 09:36:14,/r/cancer/comments/hqx80w/cancer_sucks_drug_companies_suck_too/fy0rvtw/,r/cancer,,

linebreaker-bot,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_hs528i,-1,fy8b7si,"&gt; My outstanding 61 year old father had stage 4 colon cancer for two and a half years. It spread to his peritoneal lining which doctors kept telling us is harder to treat than if it were on a vital organ. We all kept positive throughout that time. My dad especially. He’s a tough as nails USMC vet who never complained, never gave up and always gave us so much love. Endless love. It doesn’t feel real. Me and my mom were lucky enough to be there with him and hold his hands, telling him how much we love him and that we’ll be okay without him. I kept crying on and off. He originally went to the ER yesterday for a bowel obstruction, uncontrollably committing the entire night and day.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Then the palliative care doctor called me around 3 PM. It happened so fast. He had an oxygen mask on and wasn’t receiving fluids since it was filling up his lungs and his heart wasn’t responding well to it. I knew he hated the mask. I asked him to confirm if he wanted hospice care, he nodded his head. He knew it was the end. I did too. My mom was more in shock, in denial of it. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask and put an oxygen tube through his nose (cannula I think,) his breathing immediately shortened and shallowed. He couldn’t breathe on his own. They gave him morphine, so he wasn’t in any pain.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The sweet nurse offered him a Coke, but he was too weak. The palliative care doctor was very kind to my family and my dad as well, which I’m so appreciative of. My mom held his hand the entire time while praying with him. Then my dad suddenly stopped breathing. I know people always say “it happened so fast,” but it’s taken me enduring this to realize it’s true. Time wasn’t real in the hospital. They were supposed to move him to an upper floor, but we stayed with him in the dark ER room. When I realized how quickly he stopped breathing, I panicked and ran outside to the nurse station just shouting that my dad stopped breathing. Three of them came inside and immediacy began doing CPR, and my mom started bawling.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I’ve never ever seen my mom cry like that before. My sadness turned into shock, and I wrapped my arms around my mom to comfort her while she sobbed. She was staring the whole time as they were trying to revive him. I told her to look away if it was too hard. I was crying a little bit, but knew I needed to comfort her. I’m still shocked. I went through his cellphone and found old videos and pictures of me and him. They made me breakdown. It dawned on me that I’ll never get a text from him again. Never go to the grocery store with him again. Never get advice from him again.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Never hear his dark, yet endearing marine humor again. It feels like I’m not living my own life. I’m going through the motions. I’m scared of the future. I’m 20 years old, barely about to begin college this fall. My brother is only 15. My boyfriend is also in the Marine Corp, and only got to meet my dad once last year. It’s all so confusing and I feel lost and broken. I know with time me and my family will be okay again. But a part of me has died with my dad. The only thing that gives me peace is knowing he wasn’t in pain when he went, and that he’s no longer suffering but whole again in the kingdom of heaven.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If anyone out there is going through something similar, or if you’re blessed enough to have your loved one still alive and breathing, please be with them. Take pictures of them and with them. Take videos. Record their voice. Tell them you love them. Life can be cruel and short for some. I never thought I wouldn’t have my dad around at 20 years old. I’m his girl. He taught me so much and loved me so much and I’ll strive everyday to be the kind of person he’d be proud of. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. My brain is hazy right now. Sending my love out there to everyone being affected by this ugly, unfair disease.

I just need to vent. 

My dad was diagnosed with brain tumor (or, cancer, in his frontal lobe) in the end on June. The symptoms were so little so no one of us in my family thought it would be cancer. Never... He talked funny, a bit weird stuff and was a little out of this reality what we thought was caused by the heat wave or perhaps some memory disorder. It was only two or three days that he seemed out of ordinary himself. But we got worried. He thought he was fine.

So, into the hospital we went. They took blood work and CT-scan revealed a tumor. He was taken into the neurology ward and doctors said he's unlikely to survive. My dad is 67. We got him back home.

They began cortisone treatment to reduce the swelling and pressure in the brain. Some doctor decided that the cortisone level was too high so the dosage was reduced and immediately my dad got more ill so he spent a week in the neurology ward. We insisted to give him more cortisone and he went back to ""normal"" and we got him home again.

Two weeks ago they took a biopsy and said they can't surgically operate the tumor so only radiotherapy and medication was left for treatment. Until this day the pathologist hasn't told us yet what kind of tumor it is but my suspect is that it's some sort of glioma.

A week after the biopsy he got a terrible headache and it turned out to be meningitis. He had got a hospital related bacterial infection, we think it's from the biopsy. He was in intensive care for three days and then transferred into the infection ward where he currently remains. He recovered the infection and was supposed to begin the radiotherapy on August 14th. We were supposed to take him home this weekend.

Last night we were told after the new CT-scan that the tumor has grown. Do don't resuscitate and no intubation was forced. He's sleepy all the time. Only a few days ago he was smiling and laughing with us.

He has maybe a several days left, maybe a week or so. But it's unlikely he'll make it to the radiotherapy.

It's too much, too soon. I'm not ready. Myself, I work in the hospital where he's currently inpatient so I can visit him anytime I want but it's not easy seeing him kind of gone already. 

I'm praying so hard he makes it to the radiotherapy. It would be so unfair if he died now before we could even try out that option."

The only things I really pushed on were making sure he was actually taking his medications, drinking water, etc. and also talking to other people. I can understand that when you feel like death and feel like maybe it would just be easier to give up, you probably don't want to or shouldn't be talking to your loved ones about it. That's extremely hard for them to hear. So when he did mention those feelings to me I told him he needed to talk to people. So we got him connected with palliative care and they provided a therapist and support groups for both him and me/his mom. He did reach out to them and that actually led to better symptom management. 

So these days I ask him what he needs, I listen to him and follow that and in the meantime I take care of MYSELF. I cannot help or be supportive to anyone if I am not okay. That's been huge for me. When he doesn't ask for help, I won't push it. I go see friends, I go to meetings (or for you, support groups), I exercise, etc. He appreciates that just as much as he appreciates knowing I *am* there and I *will* be there as long as he asks. 

At the end of the day, I know how much he loves and appreciates me. When he feels better he shows it and says it. But even if he were not feeling well enough to show that, I'm doing it because I love him and want to be there for him however I can be. Not to try to get him to have fun, or be his sole support, or feel appreciated.

I can tell you from personal experience that you should talk to hospice earlier rather than later. My dad did not have it, but my mother-in-law did, and it was the difference between night and day. Talk with your dad's doctor about this, because his eligibility will depend on his prognosis. (Most health insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, cover hospice care in full, and hospice can also arrange spiritual/emotional support.)

Many families push their loved ones to continue treatment even when it's no longer effective and the patient doesn't want it.

I don't know what I can do to help.","About two weeks ago dad (M69) was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer. Doctors gave us a 20-22 month prognosis with treatment. Following diagnosis he almost immediately started chemo and it was really hard on his body and mind but it seemed like he could get through it. Then about a week ago he had a pulmonary embolism that was fortunately detected early but put him on the ICU where he's been since. My mom was able to see him briefly a week ago but due to covid they have stopped allowing visitors.

My dads mental health has taken a horrible turn. He doesn't want to talk to anybody, not even me or my mom. He doesn't want to move or eat or anything. He is just in pain and wants to sleep all day. He says he feels like they're just torturing in the hospital and that they should just let him die.

They have started him on an antidepressant but he still refuses all other help. He's kicked doctors out of the room and spit out the food the nurses give him.

They have finally allowed me to go visit him tomorrow for a couple of hours and I am not sure what to do or if I am psicologically ready for it. Do I just lovingly nurture him and let him complain/vent? Do I talk to his doctors about hospice care in the future? Do I tell him that he can still fight and has plenty of time left that we want to spend with him? That he has to keep a positive outlook?

I don't know what my role is and what I can do to help. I want him to be comfortable and to not be in pain but I also don't know if he should ""give up"" so soon? Especially since my mom (66F) wants him to fight and expects him unrealistically to beat the odds and live for 5 more years.

What does one do in this situation? I'm (28F) his daughter who he has always loved unconditionally. I feel like I owe it to him to respect his wishes, even if my mom or I want him with us for longer.

Honestly, I think you've already hit the nail on the head, spending time together.   
Food/Treats/Bucketlists can be tough sometimes with pancreatic cancer depending on the stage etc... but spending time together, even if its just chatting is what will give your mom some quality of life, and in the end those memories are sometimes all your left with. Its worth openly talking with your mom about what she would like...sometimes we as caregivers want to give them the whole world (re: bucket list activities, treats, etc), but in hindsight, where and what you're doing doesnt really matter, its the time spent together.   


I'm by no means an expert, just speaking from my own experience...my dad recently passed away from pancreatic cancer, he had a short (82 days) but tough battle, we didnt have a chance for treatment, just palliative care and he was on a feeding tube for most of that time (so we couldnt spoil him with his fav foods). I was ready for us to fly wherever he wanted and do whatever he wanted to do, and he was just like I dont want to waste the time/energy I have left, I just want to have some quality time with family/friends...so we had a lot of backyard/hospital family time.

He had brain surgery last year in December, and the doctors were surprised with how fast he recovered. Things were looking up for a bit. He had hopw. Then he was put on immunotherapy, which didn't work.

 From July of this year, he's gotten progressively worse. Yesterday was the first time  visiting palliative care dr. The thing is, he doesn't understand that its the end of the road treatment. I think that both him and my mum know that the cancer is incurable, but they still hold onto the hope. They think that palliative care is just another treatment to help decrease the size of cancer. When they asked me, I said it was just a doctor who prescribed medicine. I can't bring myself to tell them.

My dad's still undergoing chemo as a last ditch effort to decrease the rate the tumours are growing. How do I tell him that the doctors are nearly giving up? I tried to suggest him get his affairs in order. Write a will maybe. He just said that he wants to wait until he gets better. I'm not sure if he'll get better than this.

I got an email from my mother today. She “lost my number” and needed me to call her immediately. Not out of the ordinary for her. She refuses to own a cell phone and keeps everyone’s number on pieces of paper. No biggie...I’m used to this. 

I call and can immediately tell something is “off”. She’s a bit more subdued than her usual self. About sixty seconds in she starts crying and tells me she has to tell me something. 

Bit of a backstory : a few months ago she said she had a constant headaches and had been losing weight. She’s always been TINY. 5’ tops and maybe 110 max. Her entire life she barely ate. Half a meal here, half a meal there. Just her thing I guess. So I suggested she go to her doctor. Make sure she didn’t have Covid, etc etc. 

Turns out the headaches were metastasized tumors that spread from her lungs to her brain. She couldn’t even remember her oncologists name. Waiting on a call from her sister to get actual details. (Side note : she has the worst memory imaginable so this isn’t necessarily odd. She’s called me her brothers name since I was a small child. I’m 35 now so...haha it’s just my moms memory I think?)

I watched my mother in law pass away from stage IV colon cancer three years ago. She passed away September 11th 2017. September 4th I find out my own mother has what amounts to terminal cancer. September is clearly not a good month. 

2020 can eat it. I guess outside of my wife and a few close friends who I haven’t told yet I can yell into the Reddit ether tonight. 

Anyone have any experience with this type of cancer? I’m an only child who lives half a country away and outside of the logical “have to get power of attorney and medical decision making paperwork in order”...how in the ever loving hell does one deal with this?

schoobydoo42,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ivby0k,2,g5qec1u,"I am so very sorry that your mother, you, and your family are going through this. From what I know and in my experience as an ER doctor,  the more reliable indicators that someone doesn't have long to live are related to how they are managing in life compared to normal. That she is confused, not wanting to eat, can't function well on her own, and sleeps so much, all tend to be signs that someone doesn't have much longer to live, especially without treatment. Chemo will often slow the growth of the cancer (even if it isn't curable) and certainly can make some improvements, but remember it comes with a lot of side effects that can make her fatigue, nausea, appetite, and weakness all worse. And there's no guarantee it will help.

Has the palliative care doctor given any opinion on how he thinks your mom is doing? They tend to have a lot of experience with sick people, and maybe they could give you a better understanding of just what to expect from here. I think you are right to try to be realistic. Sometimes, oncologists can be pretty aggressive about wanting to treat people with cancer, because they want to give their patients the best chance at living. But that isn't always what every patient needs or wants. Have you been able to talk to your mother about what she thinks about her diagnosis and the treatment options?",t3_ivby0k,,2020-09-18 19:23:12,/r/cancer/comments/ivby0k/metastatic_breast_cancer/g5qec1u/,r/cancer,Metastatic Breast Cancer,"Hi! Cassidy here.

I am a 26-year-old originally from Ontario, Canada, recently moved to Quebec with my boyfriend and mother in tow.

March 16th, 2020, my mom was diagnosed in the ER with Metastatic breast cancer, spread to her lungs, spine, pelvis, ribs, neck, and the lining of her brain. It was a shock diagnosis, but not really at the same time.

I have spent years caring for her in different ways with her PTSD and depression issues. She tends to refuse help from most doctors, or at least, the preventative care required to avoid problems from getting worse. The reason I bring this up is that I almost felt caring for her in this sense would be my inevitable future, and I feel as though I grieved the women my mother once was, many years ago.

My mother raised me and my brother as a mostly single parent. My absentee father spent the majority of his time working hours away, and only coming home on weekends to clean the pool and see his friends. She did a wonderful job given the circumstances, and when my parents inevitably divorced, I chose to stay with her full time. She has been my rock growing up, always proud, always boastful. She is kind and caring, and incredibly selfless with her children. I always imagined my adult life littered with phone calls for advice on my marriage and how to raise my own children right, and then I was hit with this diagnosis.

The last five months have been nothing short of life-changing. I have limited support from my brother, as he is busy co-parenting with his ex-wife and working full-time as a Police Officer during a global pandemic. I try not to blame him for his lack of availability and willingness to help, but I can openly admit that I feel frustrated at him for not doing more.

Upon diagnosis, we had a rough initial week. My mom has lived alone for years, about 15 minutes away from me. I took her home from the hospital that night with a pharmacy of her own to get her pain under control, some food for a few days, and a long list of phone numbers to get started making appointments. I quickly realized this would continue on for what she has left of her life, for me to handle.

That week was littered with scans, new doctors, and hours of driving to Newmarket to begin talking treatment plan. I think the stress got to her, and a few days were spent hopping in an ambulance to the hospital as she was in so much pain she could not wait for me to drive her.

She was diagnosed with stage 4, with limited options for treatment aside from pain control a hormone-blocking drug to slow the growth of the cancer cells. She was given access to a palliative care doctor to help manage her pain, which to say the least, I have not been impressed with. Although the doctor puts on a polite facade, she seems to ignore the things that to me, are signs of the end of life and I am left feeling like I have no resources and no options.

As I am her legal caregiver, my only option was to have her move with me to QC as she has no one else to assist, and I had already signed my mortgage prior to her diagnosis. I held the move off as long as possible, to ensure she could benefit from as much treatment in ON as possible before we got here.

None of her doctors will give us a time frame, but my research shows that that cancer in the lining of her brain is an end-stage progression, and we most likely will not see more than a year. Her doctors, on the other hand, seem to believe that if she just stays in a positive mindset, she could see 2-10 years. Which to me is unrealistic given her condition.

I feel lost. I am 26, a first time home buyer, hoping to continue on with life as expected for someone my age, and I am struggling to do so given what I feel is science vs spirit. In recent days, she is very forgetful and confused, she has lost over 60 pounds, she sleeps 12-18 hours a day, gets sick after most meals or snacks, and is so weak she can barely make it up the stairs.

Trying to cope with the diagnoses, and the harsh reality of losing my mom before she gets to see me get married or have children is crushing, but the unknown of what to look for, when to put her in hospice, and who to talk to makes it much worse. I find myself battling emotions of anger and frustration vs. happiness and joy to spend these last moments with her. The unknown is killing me."
VTMech,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ivxx3s,5,g5unihi,"In the Middle East, as you mentioned, the doctor typically discusses prognosis or diagnosis with family if they are available. In my mothers case, it was communicated to me. My family’s values are not traditional Arab so i was open and honest with her and the family. It wasn’t good news and the reaction was very hard to manage, however, i felt and still feel it was the right thing to do. 

At the hospital palliative care ward, there are a few families experiencing the same thing. Quite a few of them have hidden the hard news from the patient.... in a couple of cases in particular, children (adults) to a mother and a husband to a wife. Their values were more traditional Arab and they felt strongly about their approach. 

My advice is for you to look within your own family, your own values, and your own knowledge of how your father likes to be treated, and handle it the best that you can. 

My family values individuality and to be the master’s of their own destiny.... we are a family of very independent people, proudly so, so the choice was obvious to me. 

Good luck, and i hope your father recovers, and i hope you find the ability to stand strongly by his side to help him through the fight. 

DM me if you want to talk

Edit: one important note, it is important for the family to stand together. It’s going to be a rough ride, you need to support each other through this all.... my experience is that everybody will have their moments of weakness and strength, and that is ok, but it is important to have a support structure to help them get back on their feet. These things are hard on the patient as well as the family.... so whatever you decide, its might be best to discuss with the family first.

My father is just diagnosed with lung cancer (it is either stage 3 or 4. doctors still discussing). They live in the middle east and for some reasons the doctors are not obligated to tell the patients that they have the disease. Their argument is that he (my father) is not emotionally capable of handling it. We will take care of him and once the cancer is gone we will tell him.

To me it seems the right/ethical way is to tell him the painful truth and allow him to make a decision for the remainder of his life.

In terms of treatment options, the oncologists are not being aggressive really. They treated her pain with radiation, and they treated the cancer in the lining of her brain with radiation as well. Otherwise she is on an oral hormone, and oral hydromorph twice a day. No surgery, no chemo other than the oral hormone that is slowing the cell growth.

The palliative care doctor doesn't speak much to me, and I wish she would as I need the support. My mom is very good a hiding her symptoms/how she is really feeling/acting when the doctor calls. Aside from losing too much weight, the doctor doesn't seem concerned. She has only met my mom twice in person since her diagnoses which is difficult too.

I made a post a while ago about my dads elevated prostate levelsPSA at 6.2. Back in October 2019. Before that in 2018 his PSA was at like a 5.something

My dad is 70 years old. We just got new bloodwork done and it came back at 5.6 PSA. The doctor refers every patient to an mri with a PSA over 4 so that’s what he’s doing with my dad.

I'm assuming you have tried a steady, well rounded diet full of fiber, fresh produce and little added sugars. I can't say enough about fiber. Find great products and easy dishes that you like to have. Simple snacks are great too. Staying extremely hydrated can help our bowels. If you have a hard time staying hydrated bc of nausea or other side effects, ask your docs if hydration therapy would be appropriate and helpful to you. See if your healthcare provider has dietician consultations or can refer you to GI or even palliative care.

Making your poop palace a pleasant place can help relax you, as well. Ask your friends to get you or buy youself some new towels, fancy organic soaps and candles, GoodWipes (seriously, they're life changing), maybe even of bidet attachment for the toilet.

Unfortunately, the cancer was very aggressive and the combination of chemo, radiation and immunotherapy (Opdivo) did not work. He passed peacefully 9 weeks after diagnosis.

The fentanyl patch — as his long-acting painkiller — along with oxycodone was not very effective at controlling my dad’s pain.

My dad, early 70s, up till now in excellent health other than taking high blood pressure pills, started having back pain a few months ago; we thought it was sciatica from taking long drives to be with my mom. Despite PT and stretching and some medication, the pain wasn't improving so at the end of August, the spine doctor did an MRI....and the results came back that Dad had tumors all up and down his spine.

So began a journey of tests and doctors; I and my mother are RNs, and that almost makes it worse because we know too much :) Dad had a very early decline: early CT and MRI scans showed all his bones had extensive cancer lesions, a CT of the neck saw tumors on his neck going up into his brain, and the pain was terrible. When they finally met with an oncologist, he put Dad on more aggressive pain management (Fentanyl patch, Dilaudid and Oxycontin) but so far he's still miserable.

Nausea and vomiting are terrible. He has lost nearly 45 lbs in the last 4 months. His calcium levels were very high (not surprising because bone cancer). He's had to get IV fluids a couple times.

He had a PET scan on Monday and the contrast made him sick as a dog and he's been vomiting bile since then. 

Today he and Mom (well, he met with the doc; Mom was in the waiting room virtually watching the visit) met with the oncologist, who told them the diagnosis, that the cancer is aggressive, is in all his bones, and is terminal. He stated we could try some palliative chemo to try and relieve his symptoms and make him feel better, but he has made a referral to hospice.

Dad is a Vietnam veteran, Green Beret, barely ever been sick a day in his life, and this diagnosis hit us like a ton of bricks. I'm numb. I honestly don't know how much time he has left; he's receiving some anti calcium drugs in the MD office now to try and bring his calcium levels down and stop the nausea/vomiting/confusion, then Mom will have to explain to him what's going on.

They live in another state, and my sister lives there too. She's driving a few hours to Mom to be with her. I'm going to talk to my HR department about what types of leave are available for me.

I did a search on this forum for ""cancer of unknown primary"" and the threads were several years old, so if anyone has any more recent experience, I'd appreciate hearing it. Or you could send me virtual chocolate. That's always good."

Apart from that she wasn’t in much pain at least. 

We did her care at home (the nurses are happy to teach you basic stuff you need to know) and arranged it so she could die at home, which was the only “good” part that came out of it. She died at home surrounded by family with no tubes sticking out of her or anything.

Oran0s,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_g7x70x1,1,g7xwkjv,"As someone who has his own grandmother go through exactly what you're going through my heart goes out to you. Part of the issues with liver metastasis or metastasis to the abdominal cavity is the cancer cells can disrupt normal liver function and plug up the normal lymphatic channels (think drainage network for debris in your body). The combination of these can lead to ascites (fluid shifts from liver that I can simplify as liver sweat) in the abdomen. Eventually this fluid builds up and can put pressure on the bowels (slowing them down, nausea), the kidneys (impairing function, and the diaphragm (muscle that helps you take a breath). We can drain this periodically by sticking a needle in and draining out liters (up to 10+ liters sometimes), or in patients who have transitioned to a palliative approach a drain that is fixed to the abdomen you can drain at home yourself (this comes with infection risks).

Keep talking with her doctors about any trials she may be a candidate for or to seek a second opinion if she's still functional enough to remain independently active (which is usually a consideration for clinical trials and is defined as the following: Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours).

However, if things continue to progress do not shy from transitioning to a palliative approach managing her symptoms and maximizing the quality of the time she has left. Find out what things or activities she likes to do and do them now while she still has the energy. That may fade in the coming weeks. Another point is appetite, while you want to encourage nutrition and activity now, if down the road she transitions to hospice or a purely palliative approach and her hunger fades, that's a different story. As people go through the dying process their desire to eat wanes. Eventually they stop eating completely, that is normal. Eating is habitual, and sometimes we have difficulty letting this go with a loved one, so let her guide you. If she's not hungry, it's okay for her not to eat. If she tells you she is hungry let her have what she wants/can tolerate.

Sometimes we get joy from flavors alone, and for those at the end of life you could take a sponge and soak up say ice cream or soda, or other things she may enjoy and dab her tongue or let her suck on the sponge. Similarly, using candies that she may like and can suck on could be helpful here.",t3_j5v2za,,2020-10-06 21:48:40,/r/cancer/comments/j5v2za/my_mum_has_terminal_stage_4_liver_mets_and_weve/g7xwkjv/,r/cancer,,

She's on morphine, has lost 25 kg in three months, is basically skin and bones and her legs are extremely swollen and she can't stand well. Mostly is sedated all day because she has panic attacks when awake. I know she is probably going to go soon but I don't want to see her in such distress. She's on antidepressants but they help little. She's also having tremors and has difficulty breathing despite having good oxygen saturation (98%).

Stage 4, not doing much treatment.","In sept 2018 my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. At the time of diagnosis he already had 13 bone mets. So we knew it was terminal from the get-go. However, he has two types of prostate cancer and we don't know how many of the mets are each type of cancer, the typical  adenocarcinoma prostate cancer, as well as small cell or neuroendocrine prostate cancer. They don't know which cancer is dominant or if they're about equal or what. The only way to know would be to biopsy his bone mets which he has no interest in doing. He doesn't really want to know how long he has to live anyway, and knowing which cancer is primary wouldn't impact his treatment choices so it just seemed pointless to do a bone biopsy. 

He took Casodex, a hormone medication for about 8 months before his cancer learned how to continue to grow despite it. He then switched to zytiga, but at first they weren't sure if it was working, and then decided it wasn't working so they took him off that. 

From the beginning, they recommended regular chemotherapy for the small cell prostate cancer, but he has no interest in doing chemo so he has rejected that offer many times. He has done the hormone pills, he gets a hormone shot every 6 months (eligard or lupron), he is on a bone-strengthening shot, and he has done palliative radiation just to reduce pain in the most problematic spots. He also did iv radiation or internal radiation, once monthly infusions for six months, to reduce bone pain from the bone mets, but it's just for pain it doesn't do much to extend life. 

It's been 11 months now since he quit zytiga and about 4 months since his last IV radiation treatment. So the only actual cancer treatment he's doing is the shot which lowers his testosterone to try to slow the spread. If he were to have more pain he might consider doing traditional radiation in a particularly problematic spot. He's just trying to keep his quality of life as good as possible for whatever time he has left.

Next month is his six month check in with his main oncologist. He hasn't had bone scans or CT scans to check his cancer growth since least December. We assume at this appointment next month they might request scans. My dad has told me that he doesn't really want to do scans. He won't choose to do chemo or other treatments regardless of what the results are, he thinks knowing has potential to make him feel worse, or more anxious about the future, and has no chance of helping. 

So anyway..my question is, can we just refuse the scans? I'm no expert of course, but I feel strongly that my dad isn't in denial about the fact that he is dying. But he has always been an anxious person, and as far as knowing what mets he has or what is growing/spreading, etc, he finds 'ignorance is bliss' easier to cope with. Personally I am okay with him coping in that way. I just don't know if doctors would argue that he needs to know about growth/spread or if he can make that decision for himself."

Being diagnosed DURING the pandemic is rough and must be incredibly frustrating. I was in the hospital this summer for a surgery and I remember how my dad had to simply drop me off and that was it. They couldnt come in at all through the entire time I stayed at the hospital. So not having that support when initially diagnosed and going through the early stages of things, whether tests or surgeries or consultations, has got to suck. I am so sorry you had to deal with starting the journey at such a time.

And yea friends and dating become complicated. I didn't lose many friends but the drift away is present as they progress though life while I am stuck in a schedule of tests, surgeries, treatments, and waiting. My cancer is not curable unfortunately, so maintainence or palliative care has been the name of the game and it just makes you feel stuck. And dating... well... who wants to date a ""stuck in time"" cancer patient to start with and for those that are willing, what are the chances we mesh. It is rough.

The key is certainly finding an outlet or a distraction.

I was on a video call with him trying to calm him down until the paramedics arrived. He couldn’t breathe, It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen in my life. He made a joke as he was leaving and I said “I love you”. I had a panic attack as soon as he was taken by the paramedics. July 16th I landed in Brazil to support my mom(71yo) and wait for my Dad(68) to come out of the hospital. 

While he was at the hospital I took my mother to a Pulmonologist to investigate her breathing, her family doctor suspected she had COPD. 
July 31st my Dad passed away from sepsis after a failed attempt to drain a large abscess in his liver that wasn’t discovered in time, because the doctors thought it was something viral.

3 days after my dad’s death we had an appointment to check my mom’s results. Turns out she had a large tumor in her lung that had already metastasized and also Lymphangitis. Her diagnosis is stage IV squamous lung carcinoma. I’m watching my mom suffer everyday. 

I couldn’t allow myself to mourn my Dad so my mom wouldn’t worry about me. She is the kind of mom that worries more about my afflictions than her own. Now I need to be even stronger not to fall apart because I am her only caregiver.

I am so numb, I cry sometimes but I just feel this dark pit inside of me.People try to talk to me. Ask how I’m doing... I don’t know.. I just lost my dad, he was the best person ever, I couldn’t hug him or say goodbye in person, now I am here watching my mom struggle to breathe, asking God to kill her soon so she doesn’t suffer. I feel powerless, horrible, depressed.

My mom always said that dying without being able to breathe was the most terrifying thing for her, probably the worst way to go after being burned alive. 
And that is exactly what is happening to her. She is terrified. 

She did her first chemotherapy treatment this week and she came out worse than she was going in. 
She doesn’t know what to do. If she should continue the treatment and feel this way with a slim hope of the tumor shrinking or just medicate the pain and wait for her to go.

I don’t know what to say...
I wish the treatment would work, but I don’t know if it will. So I’m afraid of saying she should do it.
But at the same time I’m afraid of telling her not to and missing out a chance to feel a little better.

Are you in touch with the staff at your mom's oncology office? If so, I would start by talking to them, probably they have a nurse care coordinator or similar who would be a good person to start with. Ask them if they have additional info/resources about hospice and palliative care and also ask them if they have a social worker that they refer patients and families too. They should know who and how to contact people to start the process. Also, it may not be a bad idea to find yourself a therapist or counselor to talk to, what you are going through is very difficult and having someone to talk to about it might be helpful.

Did they accept it eventually, or did they avoid confronting it?","The reason I'm asking is because my mom avoided the prospect of death even til her last breath.Towards the last few months, there was maybe two or three rare occurrences in which she would say ""Is it okay if I let go? Maybe I should let go."" But those thoughts were short lived, she would quickly go back to the mentality of trying to stay alive at all costs. She was scared, and non accepting of death the whole way through. Honestly, it was quite traumatic watching her last 10 breathes, her eyes suddenly opened and she looked around the room terrified, we all thought she was unconscious. I think she suffered pretty bad. She saw everyone one last time, except for me, I was the only one not at her bedside. I was in the corner of the room covering my eyes, peering between my fingers in horror. 

It got me thinking, I honestly feel like my mom's mentality, and non acceptance of death all the way through is in the minority of adult cancer deaths. She always said she didn't want to die. She even made sure her name was **off** the do not resuscitate list even though she was at her worst point, cancer had ravaged her body for the past six years and she could barely breathe. Her body looked/was completely crippled and she had cancer fucking everywhere, she survived abnormally long for someone in such a condition. 

But maybe this type of experience is more common than I think, and people with similar experiences tend to avoid sharing the details to the public due to the traumatic nature.

I've read a lot about people who experience a family member die of cancer, it seems most adults with cancer eventually reach a point where they accept their fate to a degree. It even seems pretty common that the cancer victim even comforts family around them, and encourages them to be at peace with the reality of the situation aswell.

**TLDR** I really want to hear all of your experiences. If your family member was stoic, and accepting of it, I'd love to hear all about it. And if they weren't accepting of the situation, or handled it similar to how my mom handled  it, I'd like to hear about it aswell. At what point did their mentality change?"

That_Boysenberry,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_jefvmb,2,g9in5u2,"You are a wonderful daughter. Please don't be too hard on yourself. Being a caregiver is very very hard and any difficulties you are having do not reflect on you as a person at all. This is sort of a case of needing to put on your own oxygen mask, before helping those around you.

One resource that has helped my family is the American Cancer Society, they have resources for family members and caregivers, not just for patients. Here is a link to their caregiver resource page -[https://www.cancer.org/treatment/caregivers.html](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/caregivers.html) . 

Also if possible talk to your mom's oncologists office, someone there will have resources for you as well. Usually there is someone who is some variation of a nurse care coordinator, they will have info about social workers, palliative care and hospice care, financial advisors, etc... I find that patients and families are often hesitant to get a social worker involved because they feel like it means they are doing something wrong, that is not at all the case, our social workers are there to help. They have experience with exactly what you are going through and are a wealth of information, if they don't have an answer for something they will at the very least get you connected with someone who does.

 You didn't mention where you are located, but at least in my state there are also state and county elderly services offices that you can call and their reps will have additional resources including, but not limited to legal assistance, family caregiver support, Medicare and Medicaid support, respite care, transportation assistance, financial assistance, etc...

You sound like a wonderful and caring daughter. Please don't think you need to do this all alone. There are professionals who do this stuff for a living and want to help you. Let them help so you can free up some time and energy for yourself and for creating some more happy memories with your mother while you can.",t3_jefvmb,,2020-10-21 06:27:16,/r/cancer/comments/jefvmb/my_mom_has_declined_cognitively_and_i_am_losing/g9in5u2/,r/cancer,My mom has declined cognitively and I am losing my patience,"I’m a horrible person.

My mom is 77 and has advanced lung cancer. She quit curative care and only wants to be kept comfortable. 

It was diagnosed this July and it was incredibly difficult to get her diagnosed because no one wanted a person, who’s main symptoms were coughing, anywhere near them.

But that’s a different, miserable story.

She has deteriorated dramatically in the past 6 months. She went from being the most well spoken, smartest person in the family to basically a child with a dirty mouth and horrible attitude.

She has been in the hospital for about 3 weeks. I have been woken up every morning to phone calls from her yelling and crying saying the same things over and over again-
“I don’t know what’s going on. Just don’t know. Not gonna make it. I’m done. I don’t know what’s going on..”

I tell her over and over again where she is, where she’s going after the hospital. Everything, every time and it’s the same thing every time my phone rings.

I work 10 hours a day, 5 days a week and she calls me when I’m at work and I always answer my phone even though I know it’s going to be an unpleasant phone call.

I can’t remember the last nice phone call or conversation I’ve had with her. She doesn’t even end the calls with I love yous anymore.


I have been working endlessly to collect all the documents that Medicaid wants in order to approve her. 

Nothing in her life was organized- she doesn’t even have the title to her car which she paid off. It was a miracle I found her birth certificate, her SS card was hidden and miraculously found, waiting from a county clerk from another state to mail divorce paperwork from almost 20 years ago... it’s like a scavenger hunt from hell.

(I’m still struggling with the DMV to get that title- My husband actually stood in line for half a day starting at 6AM with all the paperwork signed by Mom and by the time he got to the person, they said he needed a different document from where the car was bought and it needs to be faxed over from the car company. PS- the car company still hasn’t done it! And no one gives a damn that it’s for a terminally ill person’s Medicaid application.)

So on top of this, I’m desperate to get my mom into a good physical therapy/nursing home. Being Medicaid pending that’s a challenge as well.

I have no money to private pay one of these facilities and I’m terrified I’m going to be surprised with a bill that will financially destroy me.

So after all that garbage I mentioned, now here is the worst part- 
I’m losing my beautiful mother to cancer.
She is my best friend and I adore my mom.

But she’s not the same.

She’s mean. She says gross things. She has no tolerance for anything and she doesn’t remember anything that has happened short term.

I’ve never heard her cry ever, until about a month ago and now all she does is cry while acting like a child, but an angry, mean child.

She’s suffering and I am not capable of knowing what to say to her anymore. I’m sick of repeating myself to her. I’m grossed out by a lot of the medical unpleasantness of someone dying.

I’m a horrible person for feeling frustrated and angry.

She’s just not the same person and she disappeared overnight.

To give you an example. I worked really hard to get her into a five star physical therapy nursing home and they approved her. I was so happy she was going to be going to a good place.

I said, “Mom you got approved for the place I’ve been trying to get you into!”
She looked at me like she was angry and confused then goes- “I have to shit.”

I pretty much just grabbed my purse and said I had to go and I’ll call you later.

I have such funny, beautiful and amazing memories of my mom. I’m afraid this last lap of our time together being filled with crude, grumpy, crass meanness is going to be what I remember.

I read all the posts here and everyone is so strong and brave and filled with love and when I reflect on my own situation with my mother getting sick with cancer I just feel like a terrible daughter who was not emotionally prepared for how ugly this is.

Palliative care called my Mum the other day and were surprised she was going to try another treatment.

Noexit007,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_jhvcwv,2,ga3xpst,"The waiting is always terrible, but let me assure you that being ""stuck"" without progress one way or the other is by far worse. Let me explain...

When I was first diagnosed and told how serious my situation was, I felt like I was on 1 of 2 paths. Either it was terminal and I would just have to enjoy what life I had left, or I could be treated and cured (or become stable enough) to move on with my life, even if one day it would be back.

It was extremely frustraiting to wait for treatment to start. It took basically 6 weeks from the initial diagnosis to the first surgery for me (and this was after being told I would have died within 3-6 months had I not sought treatment). I had to be refered to another treatment center that could handle my case and then had to go through a whole host of tests. It felt to me like things were not moving fast enough considering my condition and situation. And it felt like ages before things starting moving. I just wanted to get through the initial treatments and move on with my life or be told I had only a certain amount of time left. I just wanted to know what the situation was.

But looking back on it now, that wait was nothing. That feeling was nothing.

My cancer turned out to not be curable and severe enough to where palliative care was the only option, but not severe enough to where I was given an ""expiration date"" as it were. In my head, I expected to either be terminal or be cured or at least get to a point where I was in remission. I was mentally prepared for either. But I was not mentally prepared to face a path firmly seated somewhere in the middle.

Needing consistent palliative care with treatments every month and surgeries several times a year and constant complications from side effects. I hit a wall early on in treatment where not much else could be done. I was told I would be recieving continous palliative care and treatments to limit growth, keep me stable, and try and make the side effects less debilitating. 

I was stuck. I had not mentally prepared myself for that reality, and at times I feel guilty for those who would prefer being stuck to only having a short time left. And I came to realize feeling stuck was far worse than waiting to be treated in the first place or even waiting for additional treatments and surgeries.

I write this both as a cathartic excercise of self expression, and as a tool to help you understand that waiting really isnt all that terrible in the grand scheme of things. The doctors and teams will do all they can for you, and sometimes things cant be rushed. Focus on loved ones, hobbies, and other distractions.

What to do?,"My 81-year-old father-in-law has been declining from Alzheimer's disease for several years; at this point he has little idea of when or where he is, and doesn't recognize any of his children. However, besides the Alzheimer's he has been more or less physically healthy (ie, able to walk, etc) up until pretty recently.

Late last week he was admitted to the hospital for rectal bleeding. He had a colonoscopy today (his first in several years) and we were just told that it appears he has colon cancer.

He's had a DNR order in place for years, but we don't really know how that applies to cancer treatment. It would seem almost cruel to subject him to surgery, radiation and chemo given his age and health, but what would the alternative be? Most of all we would want him to avoid suffering.

vbwrg,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_jlasbh,8,gao0kl6,"Of course.  Palliative chemo is a legit treatment.  

Sometimes chemo (or radiation) isn't expected to provide any survival benefit, but it will make the patient more comfortable.  If someone is in a lot of pain and other uncomfortable symptoms from a tumor, then shrinking it with chemo or radiation can help alleviate their pain even if it doesn't make them live any longer.  

With comfort being the main goal, they aren't going to do palliative chemo if the side effects are making someone's life miserable.

-my gf was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in mid september
-got cancer tissue removed from her lung, per thoraxskopy, but metastases in pleura and diaphragm
-she got a walnut-sized lump on one of the scars from the thoraxskopy, doctors dismiss it
-condition due to chronic pain might be too bad for chemo at that point, try stabalize her for it
-wanted to start chemo this week (in hospital), they made check up x-ray and CT last week
-CT shows she has approx 2 l of pleura liquid , puncture it a little
-they plan doing another thoraxskopy tomorrow and a a pleuraodese 
-surgeon first said the lump on her scar is most likely cancer tissue, then said it is not?

We don´t really find the doctors trustworthy or helpful because they don´t answer questions, don´t  take symptomes seriously and contradict themselves.
I am still reading up on it, but from what I see, the pleuraodese seems to be something that can cause an array of complications and according to my gf, has a 20% death rate (might be long term). The doctors say the puncturing of the lung has possible complications as well...
kinda at a loss, anyone with similar experiences they can share? Would be very grateful.

UPDATE: She actually refused the pleurodese and just did the procedure to have most of the fluid removed. Chemo starts next Tuesday, wish us luck!"

Oran0s,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_jpib7n,3,gbfd1r1,"So, an answer here depends on the stage of your cancer, if you're responding, and if the goal of treatment is cure or palliative. If it is the latter, if significant neuropathy develops during treatment, sometimes you can be switched to a non-oxaliplatin-containing ""maintenance"" chemotherapy regimen to permit as much recovery as possible before reintroducing oxaliplatin if/when the cancer progresses on the non-oxaliplatin therapy. 

With regard to the neuropathy there is acute neuropathy that occurs usually when you're getting treatment or shortly thereafter (within 96hrs post treatment, symptoms include cold sensitivity, throat discomfort, and muscle cramps, perioral numbness). There is also chronic neuropathy that can develop as you mentioned which is dose dependent and has a natural history of gradual improvement over time after chemotherapy is stopped, although it may continue to worsen over a few months before it starts to improve.

To help with the acute neuropathy, we often recommend avoiding cold exposure (drinking cold liquids, inhaling cold air, placing hands in the freezer). Avoidance of cold during the 96hrs post-infusion should mitigate this toxicity to some extent, but not all symptoms (eg, perioral numbness, hand cramping) are related to cold. For the chronic treatment, some individuals may benefit from SNRIs (e.g. some mixed data for Venlafaxine).

theRacistEuphemism,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_jrf0qw,3,gbtt3j3,"She definitely needs to discuss with her oncologist about an effective care plan. My family was all into traditional Chinese medicine and herbs and all that shit, born and raised on it, lots of anecdotes to spout. If you can be part of her appointment with the oncologist, ask them about alternative treatments so she can hear for herself, from a professional. 

What it took for my family to back off on the TCM front was hearing the oncologist, who was thankfully very empathetic, acknowledge their information and inform them that as there is a known and proven effective scientific treatment for this type of cancer, that's the best option there is. Alternative medicine, while it may be comforting for those in palliative care, is not the best line of defense, nor is it tested for interactions with modern medical treatment. She needs to be honest with her care team about her concerns.

Anything different that she takes or does in preparation for or during treatment should be discussed with one of her nurses at the very least.

Had a massive ongoing rollercoaster with dads pancreatic cancer. Went through various stages of being told it was operable but because of covid we aren’t doing any ops so take 12 weeks of chemo.

He went in today for the Whipple procedure and tbh I was nervous as hell about it all! I got the phone call after finishing work today from my stepmum to say that after opening him up and removing his gall bladder they then aborted the Whipple procedure due to finding 5 white dots on his liver! One of these was removed and sent away for biopsy and confirmed to be cancerous so a total of 5 2-3mm tumours found spread to his liver.

Oran0s,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_jxq4aj,2,gcyc4ww,"Sounds like the acute deterioration occurred in the past week, around the same time as starting the hydromorphone? If he was opioid naive, hydromorphone is a good choice in patients with chronic liver disease/cirrhosis, but some concern the first-pass metabolism is blunted in that population so it can hang around longer than anticipated. Generally we consider giving half the dose or half the frequency initially. Having said that, the 0.5mg twice a day is pretty light (each dose equivalent to \~2mg morphine). So the change may not be entirely related to his new opioids, is he on any other sedating medication like a benzodiazepine (xanax/valium/etc)?

We also worry that a metabolic byproduct, ammonia, can build up in patients with advanced liver disease which can lead to encephalopathy (confusion). Lactulose helps by indirectly lowering these levels (although it will provoke diarrhea), it is possible his change is related to this and it may be worth trying the lactulose.

Does he have ascites (fluid in the belly)? Or has that been a problem before? Another cause of an acute change in mental status could be an infection of this fluid. Patients may or may not have fevers, but they usually progress and get very sick very quickly so unlikely if it has been a week or so.

Those are some thoughts of what we would rule out medically as we assess if his decreased 'performance status' is related to his cancer directly or not. In general I would update his doctor to his change in condition today or monday and develop a plan on what you want to do should he get worse.

If you do not have a palliative doctor you are working with you could see if looping one in would help.

I knew he had a drinking problem (3-4 drinks a night over 20+ years) and he wasn't exactly healthy, but a few months ago he was functioning perfectly normal; never would I have thought it would be cancer. He has never liked doctor visits so he hasn't been for a check-up in 20 years. 

We checked him into the hospital a month ago and he stayed for 9 days, wanting to get out more and more each day. His prognosis was initially 6-18 months but that has dwindled down to ~3 months since his follow-up a week and a half ago. His bilirubin levels have doubled to 110H. He's on pantoprazole, nadolol, and a week ago we started giving him 0.5mg of hydromorphone twice a day to ease the pain. Since taking the hydromorphone, he seems to have changed drastically. Sleeps literally all day, has no appetite; he drank one bottle of Ensure all of yesterday.

He has been quickly deteriorating at home going from being able to use a walker, to falling for the first time today. I helped him up and got him back to bed where he laid, but he thinks he's still on the floor and asks to help him up. He's no longer the same person from a week ago, he will barely talk to us now and only communicates by nodding and asking for meds when in pain. The doctor also prescribed lactulose preemptively for confusion/constipation since the last visit, might be the time now to use it.

We just started giving him lactulose in hopes it'll help, he's been reluctant to eat/drink anything lately so it's hard to even get him to take it. His symptoms do sound a lot like hepatic encephalopathy.

On her worst days she probably can’t make it on 15 minute walk without support. She barely eats and she sleeps around 3:00am, wakes up at 8am to take her meds, goes back to bed and then wakes up at about 1:30pm. This may contribute to her fatigue but she doesn’t have the energy to wake up. She takes at least 1 nap a day for about half an hour. Lays down in a bed we keep downstairs most of the time. Before October, she was feeling so good about herself that she even believed she could go back to work by the end of the year. Her doctors don’t see that happening since leptomeningeal is considered terminal. As of right now she’s able to make small meals for herself and still go on short grocery store runs but that’s about it. Nothing really helps her with fatigue. The doctors are always pushing her to eat more but she has no interest in eating a whole lot. Nothing tastes good. I’m going to give her some melatonin tonight to see if that’ll help her sleep. Palliative care try their best. But it’s hard for her to take their advice bc we’re Buddhist. As Buddhists, we don’t “plan” for death. Life is suffering. So I think she just rolls with the punches and doesn’t try to complain too much now.",t3_k0aec3,,2020-11-25 01:08:56,/r/cancer/comments/k0aec3/cancer_patients_tell_me_about_your_fatigue/gdi83m2/,r/cancer,Cancer patients: Tell me about your fatigue,"I’m the grumpy breast cancer patient, Stage IV with brain and liver mets, on Xeloda. Diagnosed 2009, mets discovered 2015.

I’ve had fatigue since the start of this journey. I haven’t woken up feeling refreshed in 11 years. I think my perception of fatigue is probably tied up with my brain involvement since when I find it difficult to think properly, I just want to sleep. My ex husband used to get very frustrated at me for being too tired to do things, so I’m trying to figure out if my fatigue is normal or if I’m just lazy. Please help!

What I’m wondering:

Age, diagnosis and stage

Are you able to work or study full time? Part time? If you suffer from fatigue, how do you manage it?

How much time do you spend in bed each day? How much of that time is sleeping vs. just resting?

If you live on your own, are you able to take good care of yourself and your environment?

Besides good quality and quantity of sleep, is there anything that you find helpful for reducing fatigue?"

I know that. But I feel so horribly selfish when I see posts about other people beating cancer through chemo and I can’t help but feel so sullen. 

Everyone should be celebrating them, I know, but I hate seeing these posts so much. 

My grandpa was never even the type of person to get sick often. He was a typical “strong man” and he always helped us even to the point where I found it annoying. I regret feeling that way but I can’t go back and change it. He refused to do chemo because in our culture we’ve seen a lot of people die from chemo before the cancer kills them and he didn’t want to go through that so we abided by his wishes. 

He wanted to use natural remedies instead, because we’ve seen people overcome cancer with these remedies, my family agreed. This was a month ago. 

Now he’s wearing diapers and is bedridden. He can barely talk or eat and all he wants to do is sleep. We’re basically counting down the days right now. His doctor says he’s only got a month left but we’re just hoping he makes it to his birthday, which is a day after Christmas.

It’s all just so painful to see him laying there when was so strong not too long ago. It’s like the old him is dead already."

This subreddit has been suggested to me multiple times by now.

In February my mom had to go to the hospital because she bad strong pain in her stomach area. The doctors suspected gall bladder stones but it turned out to be aggressive pancreatic cancer.

My mother has been in chemo for almost half a year now. CT scans once a month. The tumor has been shrinking and shrinking and she started feeling a bit better. Her general condition is rather bad due to her not being able to eat very well. Everything tastes bitter or disgusting to her, no matter what we try.

Today my mother called me in tears.
Last week they took another CT scan.
Its growing again. Rapidly and aggressively.
They are now switching to hyper aggressive chemo and she gets a port.

I am not sure what to expect from this post.
I guess I am just venting.

My family is traumatized and overwhelmed and so far I have been the pillar that everyone relies on. But I feel myself cracking.

I am so scared that she won't make it until Christmas.
None of us are ready to say goodbye and watching my mother suffer like this is just hell on earth.

She went from mid 70 kgs to 40ish kgs. She is so thin, the hair is gone and she has trouble walking or sitting upright for longer amounts of time.

Any advise is very much appreciated.

Lots of love to all you people out there.
Please stay healthy."

Oran0s,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_k1rrnq,1,gdslmfa,"Sounds like the surgeon dropped the ball and didn't follow up with your dad on how he was doing, as well as results from the original surgery. Typically in that situation they refer the patient to a GI oncologist to discuss the need of chemo or further monitoring. Other possibility is the oncology group who got the referral dropped the ball and didn't reach out. Third possibility is they did reach out but your dad's post surgical haze led to him missing their calls to set up an appointment. 

Either way that's water under the bridge and frankly he wouldn't have started chemo right away irregardless as he needed time to heal post surgery.

What can help here is to have you or another friend/family member on his calls or appointments with his docs to help take notes. Also for him to complain to his home health agency and his physician about the home health agency. They are typically told the patient needs and should send RNs skilled for those needs. 

He should also be scheduled to see a nutritionist and probably some palliative care physicians (not for end of life management but for actual palliation and to have an outlet to talk to)",t3_k1rrnq,,2020-11-27 19:31:35,/r/cancer/comments/k1rrnq/found_out_my_dads_cancer_has_spread_to_his_lymph/gdslmfa/,r/cancer,Found out my dads cancer has spread to his lymph nodes.

Last week we had to admit her to the ER because as we now know, a series of small brain tumors are taking away her ability to walk right, tell time, sleep, think, see etc. The steroids and radiation is helping some but she still needs 24/7 care and is a huge fall risk. She already had to get stitches for one fall. 

I’ve watched the cancer turn her into the worst version of herself, and she barely looks like herself anymore. The doctors say the prognosis isn’t good, and assuming radiation doesn’t cure her, she will die in six months to a year, all the while getting worse.

DO NOT WAIT to start those options. That's my biggest regret is I didn't start them sooner for her. But just like you I hoped that it would be over for her soon.

Is that normal? Or does it imply things are really really bad

Things are bad though anyway, it’s at least stage 3 (spread to local lymph nodes) and the cancer cells are grade 3. They aren’t sure how much the surgeon removed - apparently he saw some cells on the outside of the uterus but they don’t know if he saw anything else and if she’ll have to have surgery again. (I guess I’m concerned why they don’t know everything but they are having a proper meeting in the next few days to discuss her case so we’ll see)

But they mentioned that things had changed since she was first examined, as in tumours had grown visually by the time of the surgery and I guess I just never knew weeks could be so important and that everything moves so fast.. (And of course her surgery got delayed by a week due to COVID etc -.-) But she’s also worried that having to wait another (almost) three weeks is for the chemo is going to dramatically decrease her chances.. ?

I haven’t seen her since she was first diagnosed and trying to give support over long distance is horrible. I’m not even sure how to give support. We both talk about the science of it - she’s a pharmacist and I’m (29) studying biochem adjacent at uni so we can get quite analytical as opposed to comforting?? But it’s chinese whispers on top of not knowing things, not being able to have a conversation without internet lag and i can’t just lean over and give her a hug to make up for my inability to communicate emotion.. I just feel like I’m failing. And she would have been the person I could express that fear to before but now I don’t want to burden her.

You can't cure them (yet) but you can still live on and get treatment to keep the damage low as long as possible.

Any experience with it?,"My nan has been diagnosed with primary peritoneal cancer. A lot of her fear at the moment is of the unknown, she's really scared about what the chemo is going to be like so if anyone has any information about what the chemotherapy is normally like (how much it affects you/timescales) it would be hugely appreciated. 

Whilst there is some information online, her cancer is quite uncommon and I havent been able to really find that much from people that have experienced it. 

We already know the prognosis isn't good, they'll try chemotherapy (if her kidneys can handle it) but they've already told her it's uncurable.  

Thank you in advance for any help anyone can give!"
MissHSS,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_k7fyw9,4,ger8pxv,"Palliative care docters seem to be a bit more negative then oncologists, neither is right or wrong as noone can really tell. 
( atleast in my husbands &amp; i experiance) . The oncologist is probably comparing everything to his known stats &amp; patients, and the palliative care team bases it on their experiance with that type of cancer. 

Our palliative care doc was quite negative when she came to see us a few week back, but we actually had a not to bad of a chat with our oncologist y’day and he sounds slightly more ‘positive’ ( ie his liver isn’t failing just yet, and the palliative care doc isn’t very formiliar with my husbands past surgeries &amp; our oncologist is ) .

Noone truly knows. My mums oncologist gave her 4 to 8 weeks, but she held on for 4 months.

Mets to bones which have left her essentially immobile (can transfer from her scooter to her chair/bed with help, and is still able to get to the toilet on her own). Also small growths on lungs that no one is worried about. Immunotherapy and radiation have failed her. She’s on a last ditch attempt TKI to halt the growth (which her onc says has a very slim chance of doing anything, but he is hopeful). She has had blood in her urine on and off, and her onc referred her for a cystoscopy. Orthopaedic surgeons have spoken to her onc to see whether it is appropriate for them to inject bone cement into one of her hips so she can at least weight her on it. I am guessing he gave them the go-ahead as they’ve been in contact and asked her to go for a scan. Her blood work was good.

She spent a week in palliative care while they try to sort out her pain management. While there, she had a second opinion Telehealth consult with an onc who is involved with kidney cancer trials. He said there is nothing more than can be done, her cancer is very aggressive. That day, she was badly affected by pain relief and felt really sick (she later vomited all night, they later found she had a UTI - she has a catheter so it was not obvious to her that there was a problem). He estimates she has months left based on how she appeared and said this is *only* a guess. Mum asked the question, which is the only reason why he gave her a guess. It’s not something he likes to do because he can’t be accurate.

The palliative care doctor at the hospital estimated weeks, and said she *should* make it to Christmas. She also recommended Mum stop the TKI because she doesn’t think it’s doing anything and she may get side effects (she’s had none so far). Mum wants to take it because she desperately wants more time, and it’s important to her to know she is doing all she can to fight this. She has 100% of our support no matter what she decides. She is home now, but is very depressed because she believes she only has weeks left. 

How can the palliative care doctor say this?! What is this timeline based on? They’ve not done any bloodwork or any scans while she’s been in the palliative care hospital. If her treating onc wants her to have a cystoscopy and gave the green light for the orthopaedic surgeons to see what they can do to improve her QOL, then he expects her to be around long enough to see some benefits from these interventions, right?

Honestly, it’s all a guess. My dad was diagnosed with stage IV b hepatocellular carcinoma that metastasized to his spine and lungs. Diagnosis in June, paralyzed in August, 10 rounds of radiation and on a chemo pill (he wasn’t eligible for immunotherapy because he got a transplant last year) since July, no good. He got an MRI this past Monday that showed the tumors on his spine are taking over his body and it was time for hospice. They told us 0-2 months, at best - when he was diagnosed, they told us a year to two years.

They don’t know. They give guesses, and that’s the hardest part because it would maybe feel nice to have some kind of answer.

He has a rare gene mutation called CDH1.  I met him 3 years ago, 6 months after I had tried to kill myself. I was in the hospital healing for a couple months. I have been battling depression all my life and I had finally given up. Once released I was a mess, drinking, partying, and doing stupid things people do when they are in pain. 

I met him a couple months after that and despite my protests we entered a relationship. He taught me how to live again, introduced me to books like ""The Power Of Now"" and showed me a better way of life. Connecting to nature, and living every moment to its fullest. We got married in August of 2018 and been together happy together since. 

This year when we went for his yearly endoscopy, I was sitting next to him as he was waking up from his procedure. Still in a state of being high, the first words out of his mouth was ""I want to live forever"". I knew it scared him everytime he got the procedure done, but I wasn't worried. He is 28 years old (I'm 32) he can't get cancer! 

On Oct 4th my world turned upside down when he called me and told me they found cancer in his biopsy. I stayed strong that night as he cried in my lap. However he doesn't know to this day I spent many nights sneaking out to my car and crying myself. 

They did several scans in the weeks that followed and after all that they said ""we aren't sure what stage he is in, but it doesn't look like it has spread to his lymphnodes. However they won't know for sure how bad it is until they get in there. They had to have a special meeting (we live in Utah) and Intermountain HC (our doctors) wanted to consult with Huntsman about how they want to proceed. Operation 1st or Chemo 1st. It was decided to do an operation first. I was surprised they wanted to take out his entire stomach right away I figured they wouldn't since they didn't seem to know how much Cancer he had. Now I wish we would have waited to get a 2nd opinion. Or I wish I knew about this group. 

On Oct 28th he had his 1st operation and they removed his stomach. He has two other operations after that both for internal bleeding. After 20 days in the hospital we are finally home. It has been a week, and my depression is coming back hard. I'm doing my best to take care of him, as his jpouch heals. He has tubes in his stomach one for drainage and the other for feeding and meds. 

The reason why I'm posting this because there is so much I don't know, I have to start work in a week and I'm not sure how I'm going to with how much of a mess he is in still. He still has a lot of pain when his pain killers wear off I thought after 25 days his pain would subside but it doesn't seem to have. The most frustrating part is his gagging and nausea. Is it natural for him to continue to be gagging and throwing up so much after surgery? 

Phenergan and Oxy are his life line and for someone who was in suboxine up until his surgery, I am terrified he is going to get reliant on these drugs, but at the same time I don't want to judge how much pain he really is in because I haven't been through this myself which is mainly why I'm here asking those of you who have been through this. 

When the Phenergan and Oxy wear off he begins to panic, have anxiety, and freak out until we give him his meds and he calms down. He then pukes up what looks like water for hours before he falls asleep. Then it's rinse and repeat. He regrets having the surgery because the surgeon told us during his surgery consult that he should be eating by now and drinking water. But he hasn't, he is still on ice chips. He is frustrated and I'm frustrated and the hospice nurses aren't much help either. Not to mention I hate how bad the pharmacy treats us. We get enough Oxy to last us two days before going back, and the pharmacy then tells us by law they can't dispense more (even when the doctor approves a new prescription) so guess how we spent our Thanksgiving? Watching him in pain until I finally was able to buy some Oxy off a friend. I mean it is ridiculous how much money we have spent even with high end insurance. 

Any advice on how to move forward, ways I can help him with his nausea and pain, and anything, ANY information would be appreciated. We are good people, he is a federal employee and I'm a student going to University trying to get my life back on track. This has been the hardest thing I have ever been through, I can't imagine how bad it is for him and it breaks my heart. All I want to do is take care of him and make him feel comfortable.

finneganishome,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_k83i9m,7,gewp20v,"OP, I understand fully why your depression is coming back, it's fully understandable. If you need to cry, cry it out. Honestly, I'd suggest to see someone if it gets hard. If it starts to affect your normal daily routine. PM me if you want to talk, I'm a very young woman but I have been through a lot. 

I'm sorry I have never had stomach surgery, but I have dealt with nausea and vomiting from chemo. I can't offer any medical advice about your husband's situation. I think like everyone says, maybe put him in palliative care since they know the best thing to do. 

About pain meds, please do not get worried about him relying on the pain killers. I, myself have been prescribed morphine and tramadol on and off during chemo. Assure your husband that taking it is okay and normal, as long as the doctor is prescribing it. Don't worry about him being independent of it. He is right now, and he needs it. I can definitely relate of having anxiety when the pain goes off, so please let him take it long before the pain comes back again. He is scared, and needs support. 

I hope I helped! You can't be like this forever, I am sure you will find relief and peace soon.

carola19,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_k83i9m,4,gex32st,"my mother had stomach cancer and suffered pretty much all the symptoms you describe. she also never fully got back to eating and drinking, and was constantly vomiting. for her, she was having side effects from the chemo and radiation-the area where the radiation was administered, kinda the lower esophagus, began to close off. she would have stent after stent placed in an attempt to keep it open, in hopes that she could eat and drink again, but it never happened.

with regards to her meds, her palliative team really worked hard to keep her comfortable. we also ran into the issue of never having enough of her Hycet (otherwise known as hydrocodone/acetaminophen, vicodin) since we were also prescribed a few days worth of medicine at a time. her palliative doctor called the pharmacy and arranged for them to increase the amount they could dispense, which really helped! we also would give mom tylenol or ibuprofen at times when she wasn't due for her stronger narcotics, just consult the doctor managing his pain meds before doing anything like that

meisen99,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_kby31h,1,gfmknpc,"Hi, not a doctor here but I have extrahepatic distal cholangiocarcinoma and I’ve tried to inform myself a lot on this stuff.

The really good news is that they have caught this this early: it is is really common for cholangiocarcinoma to
Be caught in very advanced stages because until it starts causing issues/blockages of the bile duct there are very few signs.  Once it advanced and blocks the biliary tract, you get jaundice, intense all over body itching, fatigue, and clay colored stools.  These symptoms are what usually bring people in (so often stage 3 or 4).

I’m not as familiar with hilar CCA but I think with all of them resection is the standard treatment.  It is a fairly intense surgery called the “Whipple’s procedure” and the surgery is usually 4-8 hours.  It has some risk but it is much better these days than decades ago.  If they go this route it’s important that the surgeon is very experienced with this specific treatment; the relative rarity of CCA means that there aren’t that many of these surgeries done (it’s all relative of course) so you’ll want a referral to some one quite experienced.  Recovery from the surgery is usually in months (for me I’d say 6 weeks but I was relatively young for this particular cancer).

After surgery, they would probably do a form of “adjuvant chemo”: that is, chemo that is intended to “mop up” remaining cancer at the cellular level (since the really big stuff will have all be excised during the surgery).

If for various reasons they don’t go the surgery
route, it is typical to do a stronger chemo and/ radiation to try to reduce the tumours.

If you want to really inform yourself, I highly recommend you Google “Up To Date” which is a service most doctors get subscriptions to through their institution.  As a layperson, you can get a one week or one month subscription and then just read/download as much as you can: you can print or save the articles as PDF.  After my diagnosis I went to town and have a binder of information (which focused on primary treatment).  When my cancer recurred again this fall, I subscribed for another week to get more information on the next stages of treatment (palliative) to keep informed.

This is a shitty cancer there is no doubt.  The fact that it was caught early and your dad is getting into surgery quickly bodes well.  His first step will just be to heal from the surgery: it is a very significant surgery, so he needs to rest and recuperate but also as much as possible participate in the rehab: getting his lung capacity back, short brief supported walks, etc.  You don’t really understand the term “core strength” until you’ve had a 12 inch incision across your whole abdomen.

On that note, it may be a few weeks before you see the oncologist, since the chemo this time will really be “supplemental” to the surgical removal. They will also take detailed biopsies from the parts of his digestive system that they remove so they will have more information to go on once that is done.

You should also talk to the oncologist about “genomic profiling”.  In this case the pathologists that examine the tumour would share some of the material with a company (FoundationOne is the most well known).  They would actually try to identify the specific mutations in the DNA of the cancer.  They also provide you with information on “targeted therapies” that are known to be more effective on cancers with those specific abnormalities.  I’ll be honest, there are not a lot of targeted therapies for cholangiocarcinomas yet, simply because it
Is a relatively uncommon cancer. But, having this information could be useful at some point in the process.  There is no need to rush this though, the biopsies they prepare are preserved in a way they can be looked at months or years later.

Anyways, this was sort of a rough brain dump, I’m happy to answer any other questions I can (but again, just to be clear, I’m an informed patient and not a medical professional at all).

I hope your Dads surgery goes well and soon his main concern is renewed boredom keeping busy while recuperating, especially in this stupid pandemic.

Even in the hands of some of the world’s top academics, you may find yourself at points where nobody really knows what can be done. The person with the most vested in your care is you. So crack some textbooks, open up some PubMed, and start learning everything about the underlying biology of your case that you can. It may be years of study, but with diligence, you can start speaking the doctors’ language. Learn enough, and you’ll be able to participate in strategizing for your case to a much greater degree. 

Decide what “success” really looks like, for you. What do you want out of living? Then, step by step, figure out how you’re going to get there. In my case, I needed to reframe “success” as simply dying functional, and without much fear. 

Also decide where the line where you give up will fall, if your case is likely to erode your function. That’s not an easy decision, and it’s unique to each patient. Decide what happens if you give up. Is it medical aid in dying? Palliative sedation? Get a DNR and other local legal documentation, so that your choices will be enforced.

Here’s the advice I wish someone had told me,"Hi, I’m a longtime lurker who has learned so much from all your posts - thank you. I wanted to share some reflections from my family’s journey. A year ago, my brother was diagnosed with a head and neck cancer. He’s in his early 30s and not a smoker so we were in complete shock. If I could go back to that first week after his diagnosis, during all my rage and sadness and helplessness, here’s what I wish someone had told me.

&amp;#x200B;

Framing: Cancer is awful. There is some end result out there that is the best possible outcome you can achieve. Today, you don’t know exactly what it is, but it is your goal to get as close to it as you can. With any cancer diagnosis, there are a ton of things out of your control and a few things you actually can influence. My advice is to try and accept what you cannot influence and fight like hell where you can.

Things you cannot control:

* How much is understood about your disease
* How your tumor responds to treatment
* How your body handles the side effects

Things you CAN influence:

* **Your choice of hospital and doctor**. There is [lots](https://www.newsweek.com/why-top-cancer-center-could-save-your-life-81425) [of](https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article/19/suppl_6/vi108/4591212) [evidence](https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-08641833117-4/fulltext) that being treated in a top academic setting (vs. community hospital) leads to better patient outcomes. Please do everything you can to get to a [Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers)
* **Your enrollment in clinical trials**. Only [\~3% of adult patients are on a clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50895/), but this is where cutting edge treatments are available and evaluated.
   * Search for all clinical trials [here](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials)
   * At first we were worried about being a clinical trial guinea pig or getting a useless placebo treatment. But we were wrong. [Typically](https://youtu.be/Rd4lCc4Nhqo?t=245), the control group of a clinical trial receives standard of care, and the experimental group receives standard of care + a new therapy.
* **How quickly you are seen**. The cancer may be spreading, so you want to get in for appointments and scans as soon as possible. Work every connection you have
   * Search your college’s alumni directory for doctors working at top cancer centers and email them. Or ask for help from your friends who went to the best schools. 
   * Maybe your neighbor’s cousin is a nurse. Or your boss has an in with someone on the board of a hospital. Call in these favors -- trust me, even being seen a week or two earlier might matter in the end
* **Diet and hydration**. My brother’s oncologist told us that for some types of tumors she sees, increasing Vitamin C intake improves outcomes, and for others, it is correlated with tumor growth. Yikes. Do your research and ask your doctor about nutrition and hydration. 

Other misc things we learned:

* Some people want you to be upbeat. Don’t pressure yourself to have a positive attitude during this ordeal. [Studies have not shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858800/) that positive psychology is correlated with better outcomes
* At the start, ask your doctor about [biomarker testing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4511498/). These signals tell you more about your disease and what treatments it’ll respond best to. We learned we should do this early in the journey because it influences the recommended treatment
* Also at the start, ask your doctor about immunotherapy clinical trials. The [3 pillars of cancer care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666595/) \-- surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation -- are unfortunately unsuccessful for many patients. Immunotherapy (harnessing the body’s immune system to fight cancer) has [flipped the survival curve on advanced melanoma](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01038-9) and it’s being tested for dozens of types of cancer. My brother also found the side effects more tolerable than chemo and radiation 
   * Search for immunotherapy clinical trials [here](https://www.cancerresearch.org/patients/clinical-trials)
* If possible, avoid the temptation to doctor hop. You want to see a consistent team of oncologists as much as possible because they become most familiar with your tumor 
   * For example, if your oncologist operates on your tumor, they will know which parts might form scar tissue later. If you switch doctors, your new doctor might feel that tissue and think it’s tumor or metastasis not knowing it’s scar tissue
* That said, your treatment options take precedent. An asshole doctor with a cutting edge immunotherapy drug trial is better than a nurturing doctor without one
* One more thing from the comments below - ask your doctor about fertility preservation if you are young and hoping to have kids in the future

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a more dangerous type of lung cancer characterized by quick growth, high mutation rate as well as early and widespread metastases favoring the brain, liver and bones. It's almost exclusive to smokers and former smokers.

This makes it highly vulnerable to chemotherapy often resulting in partial or even full remission before reoccuring at a later point. It's usually more difficult to treat by then. Platinum-based chemo is hard on the body, especially the kidneys, bloodstream, nerves and ears.

Radiation is commonly done at the primary tumor site, to treat metastases and at the brain to prevent them from occuring in the first place (PCI).

Immunotherapy is very recent in SCLC. It's been approved in metastatic patients in a couple countries but may be used off-label previous to that given certain conditions, i.e. resistance to other treatments or contraindicated chemo.

Surgery is uncommon but feasible in early-stage patients.

Prognosis is bad especially in smokers, the old and men. Anything involving metastasis or lymph nodes on both sides of the body is considered extensive stage (=palliative treatment), which means it won't ever go away but can be slowed down. About two-thirds of all patients are extensive at diagnosis.

The tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) system is sometimes used as well, especially if surgery is done.

I was diagnosed and underwent surgery in July removing half my lungs and almost all cancerous tissue, received chemo and radiation September to November. Restaging put me at no evidence of disease (NED, doesn't equal cured) and I receive prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) starting thursday. I'm a 22yo neversmoker, an extremely odd case.

I'm honestly *very* confused by their attitude, and the lack of transparency. Neither of us want/need sugarcoating or false hope.

Seratio,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_gfwufof,1,gfwvimj,"Palliative means they believe there's no reasonable way to permanently get rid of it so they focus on upholding quality of life and slowing progression. It doesn't mean hospice or end of life treatment. They may elect not to go with risky or radical treatment options for that reason. 

For example you'd avoid removing half a 95-yo guy's lungs due to risk, age and numerous other health issues even if it could better his cancer odds. Going with more gentle treatment will keep him at full lung capacity and uphold quality of life even if it'll be managing symptoms rather than a slim chance of curing him. Think of palliative treatment as treating a chronic condition.

Median survival time depends on stage
 and is about a year. Five-year survival is about 15% assuming she's stage 3. Keep in mind these are older numbers  back when immunotherapy wasn't a thing for SCLC. 

Also be aware they're not accurate for individual patient evaluation, it's like calculating the day you die using life expectancy and date of birth. Just like you could get in a car crash or live to be 105 instead the docs can't tell how long she'll live either. There's a ton of uncertainty with responding to treatment, side effects, infections and so on.

In fact, patients feel disheartened both if they die earlier (you told me I had more time! I didn't do X yet!) and later (If I knew I'd live this long I'd have kept saving for retirement!) and commonly misinterpret statistics which makes communication really difficult.

Even so, that attitude feels off. Does your hospital offer psychooncologic services? They help patients and caregivers / family deal with the situation mentally and often have some medical expertise as well.

One more thing: You can opt for a second opinion from a different doctor at a different hospital if you want to.

Palliative care actually said to my Mum ‘oh, you’re going to go ahead with the treatment?’, and Mum said ‘well, I’m not ready to give up’ and they said ‘sometimes it is braver to do nothing’.

Absolutely, yes. She's not experiencing any crucial side effects for now, apart from mild to moderate joint pain.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Does your hospital offer psychooncologic services? 

To my knowledge, no. Even if they did, my mother's not the type of a person to go for it. She is on psychiatric medication and has been going to therapy for decades with no success ( she has a personality disorder, and a severe eating disorder that nearly killed her faster than the cancer this year ). I'm the one doing the ""counselling"" and monitoring her every meal. At first I actually thought that this was the reason doctors are being so ""secretive"" about her treatment and the outcome ( her diagnosis makes her very prone to severe emotional/violent  outbursts ), but I have spoken to our GP, and she told me they don't have access to her psychiatric file. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can opt for a second opinion from a different doctor at a different hospital if you want to. 

 That's good advice, for anyone. In our case, this is the second opinion. All of this started somewhere in the middle of July. It was all extremely sudden. One day she was fine, the next she had a very high temperature that wouldn't subside, coupled with extreme night sweats. She got admitted to hospital #1, where they did a biopsy, and found cancerous cells in the tissue near the lung lesion ( I hope 'lesion' is the correct term, English isn't my first language ). However, in their opinion, the lesion was much too small to be causing such severe issues, and they were convinced that the primary source of cancer has to be somewhere else.

They put her through several tests ( colonoscopy, gastroscopy, etc ) - all of it was very time consuming and stressful. More importantly, it brought no useful  information to the table. By that point two months have already passed, and she neither had a conclusive diagnosis or was receiving any kind of treatment. Enough was enough, so I contacted hospital #2, where they said they're 99 % sure it's SCLC - but that it's essentially ""irrelevant"", in the sense that the important thing is to start treatment straight away because enough time has been wasted.

Which they did, and I'm grateful for that. I just find the lack of communication/information very aggravating.    

Therefore, I'm truly thankful for the info you provided - you sure did a way better job than they did.",t3_kdflbl,,2020-12-15 22:37:17,/r/cancer/comments/kdflbl/does_anyone_have_experience_with_small_cell_lung/gfyyo4s/,r/cancer,,
vbwrg,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ke3fx0,1,gg34pbv,"I'm sorry about your mom's diagnosis.  That's really tough.

I'm not sure who's managing her pain, but I'd suggest getting a palliative medicine consult ASAP if she hasn't already done so. 

For most cancer patients, pain management isn't *too* tough.  Their oncologist or even their PCP can prescribe some pain meds and most of the time, that's enough.  

But there's a portion of cancer patients whose pain is severe and resistant to initial opioid treatments.  Your mom has tried three different opioids.  She tried oxycodone at a moderate dose, fentanyl at a moderate dose, and high doses of Dilaudid.  They tripled her opioid doses in going from oxycodone to fentanyl + Dilaudid, and it hasn't helped *at all*.   

Sometimes cancer pain just doesn't respond well to standard opioids.  This is called ""opioid resistant cancer pain"" or ""opioid non-responsive/poorly-responsive cancer pain.""  There are many different strategies for dealing with it - and it's usually still possible to find an effective pain regimen.  

The good thing about pain management strategies is that you can tell quite quickly if they're working.   So with a good palliative consultant and team, the patient does not have to suffer on ineffective medications for long periods.  They try something - if it doesn't work, they'll immediately try something else.  The toughest cases may require a number of trials, but they can often try a dozen different things in just a few days until they find one that works.

If your mom already has a palliative specialist, then you should be on the phone with them (or their nurse) every single day that she's in agony to ask what they're going to do about it *today*.  Not all palliative services are great, but the good ones will not leave a patient in that type of pain for very long.  They will be *on it*.",t3_ke3fx0,,2020-12-16 23:57:34,/r/cancer/comments/ke3fx0/what_does_you_or_your_loved_ones_pain_management/gg34pbv/,r/cancer,What does you or your loved ones pain management look like?,"Over the span of 5 days my mom went from 10 mgs of oxycodone every 4 hours to 6 mgs of dilaudid every three hours and 37.5 mgs of Fentynal every three days.

Bluedyeblues,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_kf9bt8,8,gg7ozop,"First, congratulations on the birth of your baby.

Second,, I'm so sorry about your diagnosis. 

How old are your older children? I just listened to a really good [podcast](https://thebloodline.org/TBL/e82/) about how to handle cancer &amp; children, specifically how to talk about it with them. The guest was from [The Feather Foundation](https://www.thefeatherfoundation.org/) which is a support organization specifically for parents with cancer. You may find some stuff on their site that's useful.

I only have one child who was 4.5 weeks when I was diagnosed (she's now 8 weeks). My advice is, to the extent that you're able, throw money at the care of your baby. This is the rainy day. We have two doulahs coming to the house to relieve my husband, who is working. Even when I'm not inpatient, I'm an unreliable caregiver. We also have a cleaning service coming every 2 weeks to do the heavy stuff and to disinfect everything. It sounds posh, but it's how we're keeping our heads above water.

Make sure your doctors are aware you have children and how important it is for you to remain functional. You cannot just take to bed when you have a baby. The palliative care/supportive care team really helped me manage my symptoms and side effects, so ask if your hospital has that. Get in touch with the social worker as soon as possible, they can help with childcare, home health worker, transportation, finances, support groups, etc. Mine is helping me with caregiver resources so that my husband doesn't get crushed under the weight of all this. 

I cannot recommend getting a therapist highly enough. What is happening to you is an absolute catastrophe. And it's not a one-and-done, it just goes on and on. It's so terrible it's hard to even begin to wrap your head around it, and meanwhile potentially life-altering treatment is happening at breakneck speed. Overwhelming doesn't even begin to capture it. Taking an hour a week to wade into that has really helped me.

Feel free to DM me if you want to chat. I have lymphoma so a different treatment plan, but still living as a parent under the shadow of the big C.",t3_kf9bt8,,2020-12-18 03:18:11,/r/cancer/comments/kf9bt8/i_29m_got_diagnosed_with_t3_colon_cancer/gg7ozop/,r/cancer,I (29M) got diagnosed with T3 Colon Cancer,"I'm really healthy (besides the cancer obviously) but got diagnosed 11-11-2020. 2 kids and now a newborn as of 12-16-2020.

I say might with emphasis as it's somewhat dependent on how advanced his disease is, he has to be strong enough for treatment, have labs appropriate to tolerate treatment, be willing to go through treatment and potential side effects, etc. Lots of ifs.

They can try to get him in home hospice so he isn't stuck in the hospital. I don't know the details but some go on hospice and pass quickly others use it more for palliative care. 

The Hospital is not the place to be if you can help it. You can't have visitors in many hospitals or for limited hours. Er doesn't allow people in and some won't do elective surgeries. If he is in the hospital hopefully it has an oncology wing. Oncological nurses in the hospital are the way to go. Also see if the hospital assigned a care coordinator to him. You can call them to go over his options and services available to him and set them up. 

Also make sure he has an advanced directive in the hospital. All cancer patients should imo.  It will help him with how he wants his care. Such as putting palliative treatment over life saving treatment.  Also so they know who to contact if he's unable to make treatment decisions on his own. 

I haven't been on hospice but I'm in and out of hospitals for cancer related stuff and I'm on palliative care. My grandma has been in hospice for nearly a year. Will still see a nurse regularly afterwards.

meisen99,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_khx9p8,10,ggo40tr,"There's already a couple of excellent responses here.  I did want to add a couple thoughts that you might want to talk through with your dad.  i'm sorry you are in this position; cancer sure sucks.

Make sure you understand what the various COVID restrictions are in your area. Your dad is much more likely to be able to see people if he gets hospice care.  Is home hospice an option?

As i'm now in the palliative stage, I've thought a lot about ""goals of care"" and now more than ever my primary goal is to stay out of the hospital.  I don't want to end my days waving at my wife and kids through a 5th floor window.  We've made a couple small adjustments at home (adding a couple new outlets in the bedroom) so that if we need to bring in a hospital bed or special equipment there
won't be any issues.

at the recommendation of someone here a couple weeks ago i've been reading the book ""The Art of Dying Well"" which I highly recommend.  At this point the goal is probably to keep Dad comfortable; the medical
interventions that a hospital stay gives you immediate access to aren't necessarily ones that you automatically want done.

I'm sure you've had conversations already, but a lot of this depends on what your Dad wants. I would strongly consider hospice/home hospice.

My best wishes for you as you deal with this difficult time.

EDIT: I hate to overstress the COVID angle, but we are in unprecedented times. keep in mind that the situation is constantly evolving and we see huge shifts in lockdowns.  I had a one night stay in hospital in the summer, and it is very strange to not have a single visitor. So even if you can visit the hospital today, you might not be able to next week.  So just keep in mind this huge downside to extended hospital stays when you are making your decisions.",t3_khx9p8,,2020-12-22 06:31:20,/r/cancer/comments/khx9p8/hospice_consult/ggo40tr/,r/cancer,Hospice Consult,"A year after his liver resection, my dad was admitted to the hospital today.

meisen99,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_kiaxdb,3,ggqslxl,"I'm going through this on the other side: 51 Year old dad with palliative stage cancer (hasn't been officially called terminal yet but it's just a matter of months) with wife and two teenaged kids.  

Don't ever let people make you feel guilty for your rage or frustration. On one hand I realize I'm the one who has the cancer, who won't experience those memories, who feels terribly guilty about not being there for those important future moments. On the other hand, I have come to the realization that I won't be there to feel these emotions in the moment: my time in the sun will be over.  The people left behind have a whole lot of experiences that are still to come where they wish I was there to share an experience, or help, or encourage. And I won't be. But it won't matter to me anymore.

I sometimes feel pissed when others make it about them: but it is, it's about all of us and we are all affected.  And sometimes you will be there to comfort your dad, and other times he for you.  And then there will hopefully be lots more times where you are both at peace with it at the same time; that's what I'm kind of trying focus on the most.  There is of course the fourth state where both of you are sad at the same time... try to minimize those moments but you don't do that authentically by just burying the emotion, you just have to push through for the next positive memory.

Anyways, maybe I'm still too optimistic, I haven't yet reached the point you and your dad are at (and with my form of cancer it will likely have less cognitive/emotional disruptions: pin and the effect of pain relieving drugs are likely to be our main challenges).

Keep going the best you can. Make sure you look for help where you can find it: the same agencies helping your Dad fight cancer usually have really good resources to help caregivers manage the challenges of being in that role.  

I mentioned in a thread a week or so back that I have a colleague who had cancer himself (and the managed to put it into remission) while his wife had her own cancer but treatment was unsuccessful and she died. From his point of view it is actually harder on the caregiver/survivors than the patient. He made the point not so much in the tone of ""who has it worst"" but his counsel to me was to recognize how tough it is on those that we love ne that love us back.

He has recently taken a turn for the worst, with his brain tumor growing and his cognitive abilities diminishing faster than before. I thought I had gone through my grief the past year and a half but having to face the fact my dad will die is really fucking with my head (apologies for the harsh phrasing). 

My dad is only 58. I know it sounds silly to say “only” because I’m sure others would have killed for their loved ones to live to 58, but I’m struggling with the concept of him not being here anymore and his acknowledgement of his death likely coming up. 

I just feel so bad - my dad may not see his youngest child graduate college, he most likely won’t make it to my wedding or see my sisters + brother get married, he’ll never meet his grandchildren... the thought of my dad missing out on these important milestones is crushing me inside. 

At the same time I know his quality of life is shit. This cancer has taken everything from him - his job, his hobbies, and his independence. He can’t even fucking read anymore. And I feel horrible for being sad because my dad is the one going through this and he is the one that has to reconcile with all these realties. 

Does it ever get easier? For people who have lost a parent or loved one, do you ever get to a point where you feel at peace? I just feel so angry and depressed that my dad was “cheated” out of more years, but I don’t want to bring that negative energy into interactions with him. 


I apologize for the rambling. I know people have it far, far worse than I do and I am so thankful for the time I have had and currently have with my dad. It’s just one of those days where my thoughts are too much for me to handle.

Yesterday was a nightmare, she was gasping for breath and couldnt talk anymore. She let our her last breath after 15 hours of pellative sedation. We stayed with her all those hours. I did not sleep. I hold her hands and I kept saying that i love her and that she is my EVERYTHING. Forever. I named everything that I am thankful for that she did in my life, everything that she gave me, everything that she taught me. I thanked her for being so supportive in everything that I do and for who I am. She is my biggest inspiration in life.

In fact sometimes it's good to do a treatment break in older folks who have advanced cancer every so often when they've been on really long-term treatment (like for a year). It gives their bodies a break from the stress of treatment so their heart and other organs aren't taxed too much and can flush out the medicine.

As far as the pain, you'll have to talk to her doctor. If it's very bad during the night when sleeping she'll probably need a prescription pain medicine, if she does not yet have one. There's just no way around it. My mom also finds motrin helpful, but you have to make she yours is clear to use it. And there's a topical prescription pain cream called voltarin that's helpful, especially if the pain can be pinpointed to a specific spot like if you know where her mets are.

Growing up i knew that meant eventual surgery to have my large intestine removed, and the expectation was my life could basically move forward with periodic monitoring throughout my life. Now I'm 29 y.o., and around 20 we found out I have Gardener's Syndrome (my body grows benign, but rapid growing fibroid). I did chemo at 24 until I was 26 for my large abdominal tumor. And up until recently the tumor was stable. But 7/2020 we found out it was growing, and fast. 

Up until 2018 ish, I've felt pretty okay about life. I never had realized I had a ""terminal"" illness and kinda lived my life. I had hopes, and dreams, and goals about the direction of my life. But then, after trying to have kids and having to terminate, the docs told me how bad things really were for me and that I could never have kids. They called me a ""ticking time bomb"" with limited treatment options. 

I've been in therapy for the past ten years, so I'm really not looking for that kind of advice. I've just noticed lately its very hard to feel positive about life, or think about the future beyond dying. And during the holidays I especially get really down. Its hard to not feel like a waste of space. So for those of you out there like me, does anyone else deal with this sort of sense of hopelessness or whatever this is? How do you deal? And where are you at with things?

Thanks."
Carliebeans,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_kjky9l,1,gh7nmg5,"When Mum was diagnosed with cancer (stage IV kidney) in Feb, she had radiation to bone mets, kidney removal, then didn’t start any systemic treatment until May. I believe that was too long to wait but her onc thought she’d have radiation, have her kidney removed and be NED. When it was clear she wasn’t, he wanted her to take part in a clinical trial so we had to wait for testing and approval to do it.

Is your wife on any kind of pain relief for the bone pain? It is something to mention to her onc. Radiation treatment can help with painful bone mets, and the palliative (pain relief) course is much shorter than a curative course.

Something to be mindful of is that some bone mets eat away at the bone and can cause fractures. My Mum has multiple hip/pelvic/pubic bone fractures because her bone mets have been extremely aggressive and it’s robbed her of her ability to walk, all within the space of 10 months. In the US, bone strengthening agents are standard with kidney cancer. In Australia (where we are), they aren’t. It’s hard to understand why when these agents have stopped people with bone mets from kidney cancer from getting fractures.

So definitely talk to the onc about pain relief, possibility of radiation treatment and also bone strengthening agents.

It sounds like you are actually pretty clear on holding back on the news until you have a clearer picture of the diagnosis and what is ahead.  I’d say that seems like a fair plan - your body, your rules.  It’s up to you where you go from there but if the diagnosis is positive, my opinion (again, random guy on the internet) would be to tell the family - yes, they’ve been through a lot by your side, but why stop now?  Clearly they love you and they are here for you - that’s what a healthy family is about, so you should be proud to have helped raised a family that’s on your side.

On the pain side, make sure you get access as soon as possible to a palliative doctor (palliative does NOT mean end of life, but more about comfort from symptoms).  There are stronger drugs than morphine out there and you may be the exact kind of person those are meant for.

It is totally your decision to not do any therapy - you’ve been through a lot and I think that many of us recognize there is a time to say “enough”.",t3_kkhlld,,2020-12-28 04:05:16,/r/cancer/comments/kkhlld/breaking_the_news/gh99yax/,r/cancer,Breaking the news...,[deleted]

I guess how he came to terms with it was that after his family pushed for another round of chemo and the oncologist gave it, his health deteriorated so much (coupled with continued spread of the disease) that he himself came to the conclusion that he had to stop.

meisen99,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_kmomd5,2,ghhijn7,"Sorry for a short answer as I've just lost a long draft and it's 1:30am in here.

Main [symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/bile-duct-obstruction#symptoms) will be from biliary tract blockage and I can tell you the intense itching is horrible.

Best solution is a [biliary bypass](https://www.healthline.com/health/bile-duct-obstruction#treatment) which allows the bile to go from your liver to your digestive system. This is the best solution as you don't get the buildup of bile in your system AND you get the advantage of the bile ending up where it is supposed to be (your intestines) and therefore contribute to proper digestion.

Should the stent not be an option, they can also insert a (biliary drain bag)[https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-education/about-your-biliary-drainage-catheter] (external). Relives the symptoms but the bile doesn't end up in the digestive system and you have a pint-sized bag of bile that you've got to drain all the time (every few hours). But it does relieve the symptoms and I'll take that any day over the itching!

Both of these procedures (I've had multiple) are simple, done under conscious sedation rather that general anaesthetic so you are usually in and out on the same day, no overnight stay.

On the drug side:
Get a referral to a palliative doc regarding her experiences with opioids. Be cautious with NSAIDS which have their problems too: don't trade a bleeding ulcer for avoiding opiates. I generally combine my hydromorphone with acetaminophen but carefull to watch both drugs for daily max and frequency of dose.

I'd highly recommend she have at least a handful of a stronger pain med: if she gets breakthrough pain it's just not  a great time with Covid to have to do a trip to the ER to get pain relief that you might have just had ready in the medicine cabinet.

Hope this helped, I focused more on what you might  try on the palliative care side that what you might see as the disease progresses.

I got an arm for my ipad so I can watch and / or use it without holding it. I put frames of my loved ones around to remind me what I’m fighting for.

I am still ambulatory and can do ""most"" of my part of a 4 person household (kids are 19 &amp; 17).  Depending on the high/lows of fatigue, I can do some grocery shopping, some of the cooking, some tidying and help with paperwork and household finances.

I am currently on chemo and still intend to fight as much as I can but also recognize that the day is coming where fighting is losing battle.  My overarching goal is to stay out of the hospital for as long as possible.

I know that a day is approaching in which fatigue and pain will put me into a somewhat bed-bound state. At that point in our system I will have access to a number of types of equipment to help out.

Are there things I should be doing, buying, planning in order to maximize a home hospice arrangement to be practical? As an example I know that the bedrooms in our house have limited electrical power, and in the hot weather we have to be careful which TVs and portable AC units are on at the same time. If, as part of hospice, we get a powered adjustable bed, I wanted to know that we could use the bed and not cause additional problems .

We do have a portable AC so are hopeful we can manage my temperature even if we hit a hot spell.

Are there other ways we could make the room more practical to be ""stuck"" in for weeks or months?

I've ordered a rolling drawer that we can use to organize any dressings or other medical supplies to make it easier for caregivers (either family member or RN).

Other than that, ideas?

What are the thresholds for what can and cannot be managed in a home setting?
I assume that pain management orally or via transdermal patches could be handled from home, but I guess that IV medications are unlikely in the home setting?

I don't really want to think too much about toiletting but I guess there would a phase where I would independent but might need assistance to/from the toilet (might need a walker).  From there we proceed to in-bed pans or bed-side commode which I imagine mean much more caregiver involvement to help, help with personal cleanup as well as emptying and cleaning the equipment.

My wife and I still sleep in the same bed ... do split adjustable beds help? Any advice on how to give both partners the best sleep posible even while dealing with all this stuff?

I'm trying to figure out what efforts we can make to GREATLY reduce the chances that I spend my final days in the hospital. And therefore maximize my time that I can visit with friends and family (with lots of appropriate cautions for Covid).

Any and all input welcomed! Stories of how you managed, or cases where ""best laid plans went awry"" are welcome too. Suggestions for helpful gear (for example I want to order a decent rolling desk to be able write documents while still being in bed).

His stage 4 esphosgus cancer has spread to the brain. We found this out after he was taken to hospital by ambulance and had a CT scan of his head. The CT scan initially showed a minimum of 4 tumours on his brain. A couple days later he had a MRI and the scan showed he actually had 11 tumours we could see.

The doctors started him on steriods (Dexamethasone) to reduce swelling and he just completed 5 days of radiation yesterday. 

Whole brain radiation therapy for brain metastasis is a form of palliative care treatment to help give some additional time. He may only have up to a few months to live. I'm devastated as is he. He's been crying alot and having anxiety. 

He is being discharged from hospital on Monday and he has asked to if he can come stay with me until he is feeling more confident to go home. He lives by himself. I said he is more than welcome to come stay with me.

I know in my heart he most likely not be able to go home because he is very weak and has lost 29.5kg. He now has a walking stick to help him.

I really want to try keep him away from the hospital system for as long as possible and do palliative care from my home. Am I a fool for thinking I can do this on my own? I'm 36 and have a 14 year old son. I just want my Dad to be cared for and not be lonely in his final months."

metastatic_mindy,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_kvko5w,36,gizg6v5,"I am a stage 4 breast cancer patient. I was diagnosed 3 yrs ago at 36yrs old. I am assuming your mom is older than I. You are probably going to be upset or even angry with what I have to say and I accept that. 

Your mom is most likely at that point where for her quality of life is more important than quantity. She is telling you what she wants and you are not hearing her. I know this is difficult for you as her child but Your mom has a terminal stage of breast cancer and from the sounds of it has been enduring years of treatments that have sucked the life out of her.  

You need to have an honest conversation with your mom on what SHE wants. This is her body and her life and her choice. If she chooses to stop this treatment that is her decision and any pressure from you for her to continue radiation is completely unfair. Yes you are her child and I know you feel you have the right to have a say in this decision but you don't. You are not the one who has to endure the treatments, the side effects and the long lasting quality of life impacts. Your mom is.  

My suggestion is for your mom to meet with the palliative care team. They are who specializes in the quality of life aspect of terminal illnesses. Yes they deal with end of life but that isn't all they do. They can help your mom with pain management, getting physical therapy to help rebuild her strength. They can help with planning her next months and access supports. Studies have shown that earlier in a terminal diagnosis that palliative care is accessed the better outcomes long term for the patient. They tend to have a greater quality of life and live a much more fulfilling and empowered life.

Your mom needs you to support her decisions. As a mom myself, I can almost guarantee that she is agreeing to radiation because it is what you want her to do. She doesn't want to upset you or disappoint you. You need to let her know that whatever she chooses to do going forward you love and support her.

She’s so weak normally, but these last few weeks was finally feeling good enough to get out of bed and even cook a meal here and there, took up her old hobby of sewing which she had left behind since diagnosis, she was smiling and laughing.

He was sick for about a year.. his decline was very fast, but we always held up hope that he was going to make it. I remember when the doctor told us that my dad had to be put into hospice. It wasn't our oncologist who had this discussion, but the ER doctor that saw us for the third time in the same week for complications related to my dad's cancer. I remember at first feeling like ""This is it, he's not going to make it. Hospice is the end all be all sign that this is the end."" I felt like it was a sign of failure, giving up hope...

We met with the hospice company the next day and they were absolutely wonderful. There were so many things I had no idea that they could have provided to us: music therapy, spiritual therapy, hospital beds, medicine deliveries, etc. I remember the lady framing hospice as just another part of my dad's medical care, a part that even some people graduate from (although I know she was not referring to our situation). My dad was only enrolled in hospice for a couple days before he passed.. I remember the next day getting all of his medications delivered to the house, only it was too late to reap the benefits of what hospice could have provided. 

I guess what I wish I realized sooner was that hospice is not a sign that you have failed or giving up hope. I wish I would have gotten out of denial sooner to realize how much hospice could have helped my family in the end with my dads passing.. As soon as treatment stopped working, even though my dad seemed to be physically doing well, we should have had the difficult discussion of hospice. Because ultimately we would have realized all the wonderful things they has to offer..."

1) how quickly can we get a full diagnosis (will there be a biopsy? I presume your wife hasn't had one yet?) this is of course the most important thing because everything will depend on that. 
2) what are the options depending on the diagnosis. Surgery / chemo? 
3) is there anything that we can do to prepare for the treatment (e.g. If there will be a surgery, pre-op exercise has been shown to improve recovery) or Losing / gaining weight in preparation
4) always ask for clinical trials. This is probably better for after having a full diagnosis as the prognosis might be very good and you won't need to worry but do bear it in mind just in case.
5) this nodule could be just something that was there before and now just got accidentally detected so I presume they will decide what it is after the next scan?
6) phone number / email that you could use to contact someone in case you have more questions 
7) be on top of it all. Make sure everything is done jn a timely manner.

First we got her a walking frame, 

then weeks later a wheelchair,

last week a commode chair because standing for more than a minute is getting more difficult for her.

Today, she can barely sit without feeling the pain on her left leg. She didn't wanna get up from her bed because of this.

It breaks my heart seeing her going through all these pain.

In the past two weeks we have seen some bruise-like purplish little spots on some parts of her body - her stomach, her calves, her chest. But she feels no discomfort from the spots. Anyone knows what are those?

My mom did not want to continue her treatment as it wasn't helping, so I don't know if I should still reach out to her oncologist to ask.

Anyway, I am writing this hoping if you all can tell me what might come next. And how do I know it is about time for my mom?

Carliebeans,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_gk6620g,3,gk8uext,"My Mum was seeing another doctor for 6 months before seeing another who finally diagnosed her. The doctor was on duty after Mum’s surgery, and he saw her name on the list and popped in to visit her. He asked how it all came about and she said ‘well, that pain in my bone was from cancer’. He was shattered that he hadn’t diagnosed her. She said ‘by the time it was hurting, it was already too late’. I know that this will change his whole perspective going forward and that can only help his patients.

Like your Mum, my Mum had a delay to treatment started as well. Diagnosed Feb, radiation to bones - she had mets in her hips but the radiation onc delivered radiation to the worst side and they would ‘keep an eye’ on the other. She later fractured her good hip. *Who was keeping an eye on it?* They were delivering a palliative dose and I just wonder if they had have done higher dose, could they have destroyed the cancer and she’d be able to walk? April, kidney removed. June, immunotherapy started. 

I feel a lot of anger too because I feel like a lot of things were missed or unnecessarily delayed. And I feel like we were given false hope. Her onc was confident this was manageable. He thought she’d have radiation, have her kidney out and then be NED. That wasn’t the case. He thought that immunotherapy would stop everything in its tracks but we later found out the success rate is 12%. She never had a chance. Maybe if we’d known that, we’d have been prepared for failure. Every appointment where we get bad news is like reliving the shock of diagnosis day all over again.

And there is so much anger this is happening to *her*. Why her? People often say ‘I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy’. I totally would. If I could take this from her and give it to the most evil person I know, **I would**.

I so feel for you. I know there will come a day where I will be in the same position that you are now and I just can’t wrap my head around it. You didn’t know what you didn’t know; you couldn’t have known time was so limited and a lot of the time, doctors don’t know either. Mum went into palliative care in early December so they could sort out her pain management. The doctor there said she *should* make it to Christmas. The thing is, every hospital admission sees her in worse shape than she was before she even went in. Why is it medical intervention makes her worse?

I have breast cancer and had a double mastectomy a month ago.  Since then, I have been sleeping in a recliner due to the pressure laying flat places on my incisions.  

I finished a course of TCHP in November and started a new course of Kadcyla last Friday.

About a week ago, I started having severe neuropathy in my right hip.  It feels just like the peripheral neuropathy I had in my hands and feet whilst on TCHP, except sharper and it burns more, coupled with numb skin down my thigh.  When dealing with my peripheral neuropathy, my oncologist put me on 300mg of gabapentin, which helped immensely in my hands and feet; even though I am still taking it, it does absolutely nothing for the hip pain.

I’m fairly certain that sleeping in the recliner has caused a femoral nerve impingement as there is no bone pain.  I took my last tramedol this evening after taking Advil all week.  I am icing it which surprisingly hurts even worse.  

My question is, who do I call?  I don’t THINK it’s due to bone mets since there is no bone pain to speak of.  I have a neurologist that I see for chronic migraines but I don’t think he treats trapped nerves.  That leaves my PCP.

It's important to read through her diagnosis, save all the documentation and be familar with the treatment plans in place. Speak with the hospital that admitted her, and ask to speak with the hospital's social worker to get general advice about who your family needs to talk with incase her condition suddenly worsens.

Think about things around the home that can be improved - such as palliative aid in the form of a reclining hospital bed in your home, shower stools and rails and a back-up wheelchair for when the need might arise.

Have emergency contacts placed into every family member's phone - and begin to draft and finalise a will and power of attorney if needed. It's important to be prepared for your worst case scenario.

For your discussions with her, make sure that someone can account for her daily exercise, exposure to sunlight and to ensure her meals have a greater uptake of plants, legumes, fruits, wholegrains and general nutrition.

Ask her about when she will get her next scans and test results, and document the schedule to ensure you can track her test results and outcomes - as this will give you a rough view of whether the treatments and at-home or in-hospital care is working or not.

I don’t know if she is sharing everything with me.,"My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer last year a month before her 60th birthday. 

She (and the rest of my family) lives in another country and I was not able to be there right away due to the pandemic and travel restrictions. I did go in June for a little over a month. But mostly it has been just phone/FaceTime conversations. 

The way she has explained to me is as follows:
- it’s stage 4. Spread to the bones. 
- she has relatively little pain. Very little energy though 
- not the genetic, hereditary kind. 
- it’s the hormones. 
- radiation did not reduce the tumor too much
- the doctor said no benefit in removing the tumor surgically 
- chemo drugs worked well and her numbers are down quite a bit
- and now it’s just taking the meds to manage it. She takes a walk every day to build stamina back, eats carefully, takes her meds, and prays. My dad and my sister live with her and keep close eyes on her. 

Every time I call her she says she is ok, doing well. But she doesn’t go into details. I want to pry but am also afraid. And my 2yo son jumps in and my mom just wants to see her only grandson dancing and have a laugh. 

I’m not sure what I’m trying to say or ask here. 
Is she .. ok? Is it really that she will just “manage” cancer this way? For how long? Am I missing something? 

Both my parents are the type who put on brave faces and “carry on”. In some way, she sees it as “her” business and she will let others know only if she thinks something will effect them. I’m the same way. And it actually makes me worry if she is not saying much because she believes if things are inevitable and keep quiet to “avoid the fuss”.  That’s how she is, that’s how I am, and that’s I worry.

I lost someone very close, a mother figure at work, few years back to an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. From diagnosis to funeral was about 6 months. So now I’m afraid. Just. Hate it."

Since this fall I've been on palliative chemo and although I have yet to get a really candid, blunt assessment of my prognosis from my health care team, it is clear that my life expectancy is, give or take, a year.

I'm middle-class, middle-aged so I have a decent retirement fund that I won't grow old enough to use. Between that and my life insurance, I have no major worries about my wife and two grown daughters being able to cope financially. We live in a country with socialized medicine so a huge financial burden from my disease is not a worry.  So we have money we could spend.

A big part of my wife and I's retirement plans was going to be travel: places we have been before; places where one or the other has been but we'd share with the one who hadn't; exotic places (or even kind of mundane places) that neither of us has ever visited.   We've talked for years over many candle-lit dinners the places we would like to go.  Wherever you live, there's a good chance it was on at least one of the many trip itineraries we came up with.

So, naturally, now that I am facing death in the relative short term, my ""bucket list"" consists mainly of travel, and lots of it: foreign and domestic, by land, air and sea.

But, increasingly, it looks like COVID and its accompanying travel restrictions will outlast me. With the current lockdowns in our area, I can't even vicariously live through trips to restaurants or museums, let alone hop a plane for a long weekend in New York City or a week in Tuscany.

Anyone else dealing with this?  I know this is a ""first world problem "" but I feel really pissed off that the year I develop a terminal disease ends up being the year that the world practically shuts down.

Re-reading this I feel know that this sounds really entitled, so I'll understand if some of y'all roast me.  I know I am fortunate in many ways, but sometimes that is easy to overlook when I know I've got a year or so left before shuffling off this mortal coil.

Anyone else dealing with this? Found creative ideas to alleviate the aggravation? I'm open to other perspectives and ideas."
meisen99,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_l9i1x9,4,glig9s6,"My experience (also in Canada) and others I have spoken to is similar: the process feels very slow between the initial detection (of a lump, or in my case, cell brushings taken during an endoscopy) and lining up treatment. For me the wait to get a PET scan (required to proceed with surgery which is the standard treatment for bile duct cancer) seemed like it took forever.

My sense has always been that many cancers are relatively slow-moving and so cancer treatment tends to move a bit slowly as they make the best decision they can, especially since the treatments (highly invasive surgery, poisoning your body with chemo, or blasting it with radiation) has a lot of potentially hard impacts on your body.  The medical team is trying to make sure the cure isn't worse than the disease.  My experience (and of others I've talked to) is that once they've decided on the plan, things accelerate a lot and next thing you know you've got all sorts of treatments, imaging, blood work, follow up appointments, palliative treatments to alleviate side effects of treatment or other side effects of advancing disease, etc.

Anyways, that's my 2c, it might be a bit ""apologist"" but my sense is that what you are experiencing is fairly typical. Whether it's normal, or logical, or fair, I'm less sure of.

On the second opinion front, I think it is always a good idea.  You may also want to look at ""Up To Date"", it's a paid service most medical facilities subscribe to but a consumer subscription is $20/week.  It is what it's title suggest, it is generally very up to date information on a vast number of medical topics.  I've subscribed twice, for one week only, printed/downloaded gobs of information.  You'd probably get a pretty good idea of what the most current treatments are for your particular cancer, if there are alternative or newer advanced treatments, etc.  I've tried to stay well informed about my disease so I can have a reasonably intelligent conversation with my oncologist and my surgeon, and I thought for $20 I was able to get an awful lot of current information very quickly and easily.

I am a 31F who just recently diagnosed with Soft Tissue sarcoma. It started with some pain in my upper thigh last october. One month later I got an ultrasound and immediately the ultrasound technician noticed the lump and mentioned possible sarcoma on there. Then I had an MRI, ultrasound, and PET Scan that took 1 month to get results on. Ultrasound came back benign but the doctor (a Sarcoma Specialist) wasn't convinced (the tumor is about the size of a peach). So more tests. And earlier this week, a second biopsy confirmed that the 8x6cm inch tumor in my thigh is soft tissue sarcoma.

They are still trying to figure out what type specifically, and what the best treatment plan is (they are talking about radiation, surgery and possibly removing some lymph nodes).

I'm just in a bit of a shock, and lost about what to do next, what questions to ask, how to best advocate for my care, etc. I'm a bit worried because with my current doctor things are moving quite slowly - they have been aware this is a tumor since mid november, but tests/appointments/results have been kind of slow, they just confirmed it's cancerous, and with all the other tests/meetings planned, it is possible actual treatment may not start till march. I've been reading and I know it's best to test thoroughly and be sure before any surgery but... I'm still unsure. Is it normal for things to be this slow?

They've mentioned that during surgery they may have to take out a couple of muscles in my thigh to make sure the cancer doesn't return, which may affect my mobility. They are also talking about taking all of my lymph nodes in my leg, which may lead to lymphedema, etc. I don't know what to think of all this.

Should I get a second opinion? What are the best Sarcoma treatment centers in Canada? Any support groups on this would also be greatly appreciated.

TIA! (And sorry for the wall of text)"

So, I wasn't there for his oncology appointments. Partly due to COVID, partly because I work full time so I just wasn't available much. He took extensive notes for me. I suggest doing that. It's a lot of information but over time you'll get familiar with all of the terminology and stuff. Also, find out about palliative care. They help with side effects including mental health and in our case they offered support for family members. I went to one meeting with them which was really nice, because I got to see the people who were at the head of it all. I don't believe his oncologist was there, but he's a very busy guy! My boyfriend's mom also spoke to them a few times, because of course it has been really hard on her. That would probably be your best avenue for support for yourself and to be informed on everything. 

You may want to ask what the diagnosis means in terms of likelihood of a cure, etc. That was a difficult choice. My boyfriend did not want to know but I did, so I asked and I kept it from him. The thing is, they told me it was terminal. And now almost a year later, he is most likely cured. So that's just something you have to decide whether you want to know, and also KNOW that they could be wrong! 

At the beginning I felt like I wanted to/needed to do whatever I could to save him or make him feel better physically, emotionally, etc. Over time I learned to trust his team and the people in our lives who could support us outside of each other. I realized there was only so much I could do to help. That mostly came down to being there for him, but also to let him learn how to be there for himself and use his resources. Friends who are *not* as close to the situation are really important. He has people he can talk to when he feels really down. We learned that I was not the best person to say something like, ""I've accepted death"" to haha. I mean, sure, I understood what he meant and that was a good thing for him.

[deleted],t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_lcdb81,3,gm0qjds,"Stage IV is considered non-curable, but it is treatable (that's what's called palliative care).

Don't put too much into the idea that protocol in the book will cure cancer (or even send it into remission). BUT the way she is eating is good for her (although you will likely come to the point where additional protein is needed in her diet). And I'm very glad her Dr. is on board with it. There are a LOT of nasty physical issues that accompany cancer (and more so, accompany it's treatment drugs). It's refreshing to hear of a Dr. that doesn't just want to throw more drugs at symptoms but instead is of the mindset to get the system working to the best of its ability to prevent the issues when possible.

Also, I'm sorry your young adult years are wrapped around this. I'm in a condition similar to your Mom (unable to do simple tasks, lots of time sitting, etc.) and it pains me to think of what I am doing to my son by being so sick. However, recently I've come to see the Stage IV as a gift. There are all sorts of little moments we are experiencing together - really getting to know each other as equal adults.

Is there really no hope for her to be cured?,"My mum (53) has stage 4 breast cancer. It has spread from her breast to her lymph nodes, spine and her liver. 

I’m 21 and I look after her everyday and the thought of her not being around in the future is really tough. She sometimes cries about the fact that she might not be able to meet my kids, be at my wedding, and to be around for me and my brother in the future. 

Her health has deteriorated quite a bit since she was diagnosed, with most of her issues being with her back and not being able to do simple tasks because it puts her in too much pain. Just 2 months ago she was healthy and we were on walks together laughing about stuff and now she’s spending most of her days on the sofa, unable to bend over to pick something up, crying everyday in sadness because she has an incurable illness. I can’t put into words how cruel this is for her. 

She is currently reading a book called, “how to starve cancer”. Reading this book has given my mum the hope that the doctors didn’t give her - that she can cure her illness. 

We are doing everything that we can. I make her loads of juices, from organic vegetables and fruits, organic plant based meals, no dairy, no meat (she does eat organic fish) and has various supplements (recommended by the author). Her diet is really good and is tapered to starve the cancer. 

All of this has been run by the doctor and he is happy with everything she is taking (no chemo interactions). 

I suppose my question is, with adjuvant treatments that we are trying alongside her conventional treatments and chemo, is it still unlikely that she will ever be cured from cancer? I see online how everyone says stage 4 is incurable and life expectancy is a few years. The oncologist said that it can be managed for a few years, but this book claims otherwise and there are testimonies of people overcoming cancer at this stage.

cancerkidette,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_leqx4z,5,gmhidgm,"I concur with the other commenter here- it’s hard to assess or to condemn the behaviour of a terminal patient because it’s very likely she is feeling a number of negative emotions and depends on your mother. Perhaps she feels anxious with anybody else or needs to have company to distract her from her situation. Try not to reproach her for her behaviour but reassure her you love and care for her and want to keep her comfortable. Perhaps it would make sense to keep a little fridge next to her bed so if she wants to, she can reach her own juice or water and doesn’t need to worry about someone else getting it “wrong”.

I think first of all the nature of her discomfort needs to be addressed - what do her doctors think of this? Does she have a palliative or pain team that is in contact with her regularly? If at all possible I would look into therapists who work with other end-stage patients to speak with her. Sometimes it’s helpful to speak with someone who isn’t around you all the time.

This post is about concerns I have about my family regarding home hospice care. If this post isn’t appropriate for this subreddit, please let me know. 

My sister (21) has been at home receiving hospice care since early July 2020. She unfortunately has terminal brain cancer, a malignant glioblastoma tumor. 

At first we were given til the end of the year, then we were told we had three weeks and now we just renewed our hospice license. It’s a blessing and a curse that she is around. It feels horrible saying that, but my sister is at a point at which she can hardly talk, see or hear. While I do not want her to pass, I can’t help but feel this suffering and pain is gratuitous. It’s a complex emotion. 

I am becoming extremely concerned about certain things happening around the house. We do not have an aide, so all of the work falls onto the family. In the beginning it was fine, but as the disease progressed things became more and more difficult. 
Lately, a majority of the work falls on my mother. She sleeps in my sister’s room each night and is the primary caretaker. However, it has gotten to the point that no one but my mother can do anything for her. Rather than asking me or my grandmother to give her juice/water, she will ask us to get my mother who is on a different floor of the house to come and give her water. When we say “Mom is busy”, my sister asks us why we fight her and why we are being difficult. 

Another example of this behavior is when I offered to let my mother sleep in her own bed for the first time in months. Although I was right next to my sister, I had to get up and wake up my mother to give her juice and adjust her position in bed at least three times that night.

I understand my mother may make her the most comfortable, but I’m becoming concerned. My mother really needs a break and will just never get it. Everyone notices this behavior and no one wants to talk about it in fear of upsetting my sister. My sister will also tell my mother things like “He spilt juice on me”, when I put my foot down and say mom is not able to right now because she’s busy. I did not spill juice. 

My sister also refuses to take painkillers although she’s only in “positional pain” (my family’s new favorite phrase). Although she’s not in “pain”, she’s constantly in discomfort asking us to adjust her body for her since she cannot move. During the day, this is no problem. But my mother is constantly woken up to move her at night. One time, the family counted 23 times in one night. 

I do not want my mother to be burnt out. I’m also concerned they may be too attached, but that’s another discussion.

I’ve mentioned to my sister that I am around to do smaller things and that mom may need a break during the day. But when I do that, my sister reacts poorly and I feel worse than ever.

Is it better to leave something like this as it is? Am I being rude for this concern? Is this normal behavior for a hospice patient? I don’t want to push things too far, but I will be leaving the house soon due to work re-opening and I am concerned for everyone."

Since this fall I've been on palliative chemo and although I have yet to get a really candid, blunt assessment of my prognosis from my health care team, it is clear that my life expectancy is, give or take, a year.

I'm middle-class, middle-aged so I have a decent retirement fund that I won't grow old enough to use. Between that and my life insurance, I have no major worries about my wife and two grown daughters being able to cope financially. We live in a country with socialized medicine so a huge financial burden from my disease is not a worry.  So we have money we could spend.

A big part of my wife and I's retirement plans was going to be travel: places we have been before; places where one or the other has been but we'd share with the one who hadn't; exotic places (or even kind of mundane places) that neither of us has ever visited.   We've talked for years over many candle-lit dinners the places we would like to go.  Wherever you live, there's a good chance it was on at least one of the many trip itineraries we came up with.

So, naturally, now that I am facing death in the relative short term, my ""bucket list"" consists mainly of travel, and lots of it: foreign and domestic, by land, air and sea.

But, increasingly, it looks like COVID and its accompanying travel restrictions will outlast me. With the current lockdowns in our area, I can't even vicariously live through trips to restaurants or museums, let alone hop a plane for a long weekend in New York City or a week in Tuscany.

Anyone else dealing with this?  I know this is a ""first world problem "" but I feel really pissed off that the year I develop a terminal disease ends up being the year that the world practically shuts down.

Re-reading this I feel know that this sounds really entitled, so I'll understand if some of y'all roast me.  I know I am fortunate in many ways, but sometimes that is easy to overlook when I know I've got a year or so left before shuffling off this mortal coil.

Anyone else dealing with this? Found creative ideas to alleviate the aggravation? I'm open to other perspectives and ideas."

Oh and daily radiation appointments (palliative) to keep the cancer from wrapping around his spine and paralyzing him. I, too, was so angry. I was angry when the cancer in his brain made him believe his solar power was fucked up and I walked in to him pulling fuses out of his fuse box and I couldn’t figure out how to fix it. I was angry at him when he yelled at me for an entire car ride for going the wrong way. I was angry at him for so many things.

My dad is diagnosed with stage IVb lung cancer 5 months ago. He went into the coma due to a lung infection 2 weeks ago and got out after antibiotics took effect. Also although he got on Keytruda early on, his aggressive cancer metastasized to his brain.  We are doing radiotherapy for that and we are hopeful. 

This last 5 months has taken a humongous toll from our family. I had to get an extended family leave to be with my dad in our home country and help my family (I left the US around a month ago). My toddler is also with us and the  change to her routine (and probably our emotions she is picking up) has made her erratic and nervous. She has had two long tantrums and we did not have the energy and peace of mind to soothe her.
Also the whole Covid situation is crazy here. No social distancing and not much concern about mask wearing even in hospitals and ambulances. My mom is also involved in the care and she is senior vulnerable to Covid. Our extended family had stopped helping us 2 weeks into the process (and my dad's family made a drama out of it that drained even more energy).

I feel so overwhelmed and need some words of encouragement. I am his older son paying for his treatment out of our little saving(~40k already).

The doctors have also already adjusted her treatment, lowered the dosage and spaced out her treatments more than usual, which could be part of why the results seem less effective.

Based on the way each treatment has made her feel worse than the previous one, she doesn't want to keep up treatment. She'd like to live what time she has left with less pain and misery. Throughout her illness, most of her pain and side effects have been caused by her treatment (recovery from HIPEC surgery and chemo) rather than her cancer.

Bluedyeblues,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_loqd24,6,go8phg6,"Here's my advice:

1. Palliative care. These people were amazing at hooking me up with solutions to my problems, and not just meds. I cried harder at my palliative care appt. than I did when I was diagnosed. 

2. Therapy. I wouldn't have made it this far without my therapist. This is something that your oncology or palliative care people can recommend for you. It would be good to find someone who has experience/specializes in treating those with life-threatening illness. Encourage your caregivers to get a therapist, too, as this is extremely hard on them. I imagine it's your parents? If they're anything like mine, they're terrified and exhausted and grieving and brimming with rage. 

3. Support groups. I visit these when I am feeling better. I've collected a group of peers going through something similar (I got cancer while I was pregnant) that I talk to from time to time. I've also taken some writing classes to help deal with my feelings. Everything is online now, so there's lots of courses and groups you can join about cancer. You may even find one for your rare type.

4. All the things. Heating pads, ice packs, compression socks, loose pajamas, stupid phone games, lots and lots of sweet drinks -- anything that gives me even momentary relief or distraction. If it sounds even mildly interesting or effective, do it. 

I ask myself a lot why this happened. Am I being punished? Am I being strengthened? Do I deserve this? The answer is no, and that's actually more frightening. There's no reason. Your number came up, that's all. It's completely senseless. You can try to create some meaning or lesson or benefit, or you can just focus on getting through it and move on.

I am still a kid what did I do to deserve this? I’ve been having a really tough time with chemo it fucking hurts so bad. They give me medicine but it is still torture. I sometimes really want to give up. I feel like I’m in hell. Is this some punishment from God? So far I’ve learned one lesson from this. I learned what the phrase “I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.” I would not want anyone to go through what I’m going through. I feel super alone because even though people are supporting me, I’m the only fucking one in pain. It’s really frustrating. I am very thankful that we caught this tumor in it’s early stages and very blessed that I’m able to get treatment. But still I know that some people have it worse than me. How do you guys deal with the chemo? I really just want all of this to end. Also I have a terrible fear that when I’m done with all of this that the cancer may reoccur. I can’t even handle this set of chemo, I don’t know what I would do if I had to do it again. Ik people just say chemo sucks and I have to tough it out, but it is so astronomically hard to do that. I can’t eat, drink, do anything for that matter. Please offer me some advice on how to cope with all this. I’m in desperate need of help. Thank you if you read this far and I really hope that all of you are doing well."

She has malignant ascites from the breast cancer that spread to her abdomen (apparently it is rare so any info is nice). Shes had her stomach drained multiple times and in june when she was first being hospitalized they had thought it was just a hernia- so they began to drain her and pulling like 8-10 liters of liquid from her like im not lying my mom had looked like she was pregnant and then very skinny for a couple months until her medicine kicked in shes been on ibinzo or something like that?? From what i gather is a chemo pill or she also has been taking that - sorry english major over here guys. But she had showed me an article a few months ago saying that the survival rate was low and she didnt have very much time to survive. I wanted to know any information regarding this, any information about if their is a cure and how serious this diagnosis is now in 2021.

If you want to privately chat I'm open to that any time

I'm by trade, a hospice/ palliative care nurse. It's my passion. And I've assisted many people with cases like yours. 

My 10yr prognosis is shit. I'm dealing with it. I'll be happy to share with u whatever I can.",t3_lr32nf,t1_gok1b6r,2021-02-24 06:18:31,/r/cancer/comments/lr32nf/messaging_overall_prognosislife_expectancy/gok1b6r/,,Messaging overall prognosis/life expectancy?,"
How up-front are people with their social network about a dismal prognosis?

I have a GI cancer that from day 1 I understood the 5 year survival rate to be less than 10%.  Since then, various signs (surgery went well but had positive margins; high level of lymphatic involvement; recurrence of cancer after surgery and adjuvant chemo within 13 months; developing ascites) have pointed to me NOT being part of that 10% cohort.  I'm still doing OK (main problems are really a function of chemo, not cancer) but it continually seems I'm not fated to be one of the extra lucky ones. It seems like now it is a waiting game to see how long chemo can fight off cancer before I turn that corner into end-stage disease.

I can't get a really exact timeframe from my oncology team (which I totally understand).  Best estimate I've gotten is likely months, maybe as long as 18-24 but more likely under 1 year).  I keep waiting for the next image, the next exam to bring that number into more focus but so far it is still pretty vague.

I feel like I ""should"" be communicating more to people that my time is limited. I do tend to stress that I am on palliative not curative treatment and explain to people that this means they emphasize quality of life over curing the disease.  But, that still doesn't have the gravity of saying ""I've got a year left"" and I feel like people are going to tend to layer this on top of their personal experience, which for many of us (fortunately) is limited to a number of more common but more curable cancers.  I don't want to come across as this negative guy but at the same time Let people know that a ""cure"" is not likely for me. On the other hand, I don't want to manage people's expectations to a short time period and then feel wierd about outliving various guesses about how long I have.  Does that sound messed up?

Anyone else experience this?  Any thoughts on how you've handled it, both within your more intimate personal network like close family, as well as among a broader social network with whom you are communicating more broadly like via a blog or social media?

Thanks in advance... and fuck cancer."

I've generally got three similar lists: immediate family and best of friends: they tend to get news almost immediately and directly, either by phone call or text (depending on the nature).  Then, I have an email which is slightly bigger, mainly family that I'd still like to hear news before the ""general public"". Finally, I have a Caring Bridge site to which I post content: sometimes not that materially different than the email I sent, but usually a bit later by a day or two... my Mom and Dad hear directly from me, Auntie Betsy gets an email but a work colleague that follows my journey might hear a couple days later.

It all happened after she went sleepless a few days after her diagnosis (appendix and ovarian cancer) and all the rushing thoughts that came with it. Before she knew it, her anxiety was starting to controll her to the point that her brain actively fought against sleep. She has routine heart palpitations while trying to drift off. The doctors at Kaiser don't want to prescribe her any more than a week's worth of Restoril, all the other stuff like antidepressants hardly work at all, we're getting kinda hopeless here. Does this happen to people who get diagnosed with cancer? And if so, what ways do you handle it better?

Asking on behalf of both my mother since she doesn'thave reddit, and myself

A little backstory to the question: The last year and a half have been absolute hell on earth. First my father (her husband) got diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and he can't do anything anymore (speak, walk properly, dress or take care of himself, etc.). She suddenly was alone and had to take care of me (17 at the time) and my brothers (13 and 16 at the time). 
Then, three months later, we got another bomb dropped on us.

Her mother (my grandmother) is the first known case of a cancer patient in my family. She was diagnosed in august of 2019. She has terminal pancreatic cancer, and she is taking care of her (she is a RN, but ofc it's very difficult taking care of a terminally ill mother). It's one of the worst experiences we have ever had. We have gotten phone calls from my grandma in during the middle of the night, screaming and crying in pain. 

We have also had countless hospital encounters where she has been throwing up everywhere, passed out, and she has even been denied more chemo because it can help anymore.


The problem is, we live in a small city, and there is no support group for family members of a cancer patient, so until further we are trying to get some tips from other who have had the same experience on what might help take our mind of it. 
Right now it is a lot to take in. Does anyone else have any kind of tips or things/activites that may help?"

She knew as soon as I was strong enough I would protect her and the time came when I was 19 I was old enough to help her be strong enough to leave the abuse. 

She divorced my father and after a few years met her real soul mate, and settled down again with an absolutely lovely guy who I’m proud to say has been more of a father to me than my biological dad. 

We don’t live particularly close (around 1.3hrs drive) so we spent a lot of the last years talking on the phone and txting every day and visits when possible. The visits of which had to stop because of Covid. 

When I found out she had rectal/bowel cancer I was naturally devastated but I was filled with hope that she was only 67yrs old and fairly fit and healthy. I was sure they could treat it and I was praying every day that the time would come and she could call to say she was in remission and on the mend. 

She had intense radio therapy and a round of chemo therapy and started to really pick up. Her appetite came back and she was putting on weight again. Then she went to a follow up scan a couple months after, where they found the cancer had spread to her bladder and near her spine. Sadly they decided there was nothing more they could do and handed her over to palliative care team. 

Obviously she has been in agony, pain wise over the last year and now watching her suffer out her last few days has me shot through to shit. 

She’s at the point where she has a syringe driver on, so she’s either in extreme pain, so they increase the morphine/oxycodone or comfortable but not really with it. 

I’m absolutely devastated, to the point where I cry so much my heart hurts and feels like it’s going to burst. My brain is like cotton wool, people talk to me and my eyes are open but no ones home. It feels like, I’m Just a shell shocked body walking round with so much going on in my thoughts they become loud and noisy and I can’t escape it. It almost feels like I’m screaming in silence!

Why does end of life have to be so fucking cruel? If you or anyone, on end of life get told there is nothing you or they can do and it’s end of life, you should be offered assisted suicide drugs so that you can choose when it ends. 

Watching my mother drift in and out of consciousness and the cruel way she went right through the treatment for it to end up terminal has me convinced more then ever that end of life care should very much include self assisted suicide. 

TL:DR 
Mother on final days before death and rather than suffer the NHS should be allowed to help  by prescribe medicine that will end life rather than someone having to suffer incurable pain."

As someone who used to work in hospice and palliative care, the very general guideline we’d tell families is that when you start seeing more changes with increasing frequency (less time between), it can be a sign that the person is getting closer to death. We’d offer a blue booklet called “Gone From my Sight” that did a good job of explaining the different changes you’d see within weeks of death, within days, and then within hours.

The only downside is that in my case pills were twice daily for two weeks, then one week off, versus one dose weekly for two weeks and then one week off, you don't have to do anything except for the two chemo days (so two days instead of 14).  However, contrasting a trip to the bathroom to swallow a couple pills versus driving all the way to the clinic (for me, 30' each way), 2 hour IV session, 30' drive home = 3h... the pill is MUCH more convenient.

One tip: find out the pharmacy's policy on people other than the patient picking up the chemo pills... in our case, rather than keeping that on file, as long as the person has a brief letter authorizing the pickup (we got a cancer agency ID number to clearly identify the patient), they can pick it up.  People will want to help, and honestly having folks be your drug courier is a great task to delegate to people, and people DO want to help you out.

One of the big struggles right now is him losing a lot of weight and I'm struggling to figure out how best to support him and at least minimize the rate that he loses it. There's of a factors in tension right now. My dad's stomach has always been sensitive and it's gotten worse as he has aged (He's over 60) and the issues have been amplified on chemo.

He's been dealing with hemorrhoids, I think are caused by hard stools, and diarrhea so we're doing a balancing act between what he feels like eating, getting him to eat, getting him to have enough calories, and him being demotivated to eat by the consequences he faces from what he's eating on his bowels, which can be on extreme ends of the spectrum.

I'm not the only caregiver, my mom is one too, and she's the one who has the bulk of the medical information so I do want to note that the reason I push this is because I'm being told that's what needs to happen.

Today my dad hasn't eaten anything and has been in bed all day and it's well past noon, at the time of writing this it's almost 3. Now I want to specify, I'm not upset that he hasn't gotten out of bed because I understand his body is dealing with a lot but I think it's pertinent detail. Here has been my process:

* Around 10:00am I checked on him
   * I ask him if I could bring up the rest of the can of ginger-ale and get him to drink what I brought earlier which he did
* Around 10:00am I checked on him
   * I asked if he had breakfast yet, he said no
   * I asked if I could make him anything, he said no
   * I asked if I could get him to drink a Boost (high calorie protein shake), he said no
   * I asked if I could get him something to drink, he said yes, a small glass of ginger-ale (About half a can) which I did
* Checked in around 1:00pm
   * Saw that he hadn't had the ginger-ale I gave him
   * Asked if I could get him to eat anything or was up for a Boost at this point, he said no
   * He tells me about the diarrhea he experienced last night and only wants something light to drink
   * I ask him if I could bring up the rest of the can of ginger-ale and get him to drink what I brought earlier which he did

Is my approach lacking? Do I need to do something different? Be more insistent? I'm really scared for him.

My mom has been more resistant to letting him eat whatever he wants and I'm mixed up on if that's a good approach or not?   
For instance, he'll say he wants fig newtons and she'll say he really needs to be eating something with more calories. And on one hand that's true but on the other I'm worried it's demotivating him to eat since he is very obviously feeling like he like lacks agency.   
I did suggest that maybe I could try making fig newtons myself and trying to add more calories to the recipe so he can have the foods he wants be more accessible; I haven't been well supported on that idea because mom thinks I lack the skills.

Right now, I'm trying to figure out if I can at least alleviate the problems he's experiencing with digesting by anticipating if he's likely to have diarrhea or tough stools. Does anyone have experience with this? Would that work?

The easiest way to advocate for yourself is to be prepared. 

1. What symptoms do you have that you want treated? Be as detailed as possible about location, duration, frequency, cause. They like when you describe the pain in one adjective (burning, stabbing, piercing, etc.) and on the 1-10 pain scale. Hint: anything over 6 is considered unmanaged.

2. How does the pain affect your life? Trouble washing? Dressing? Driving? Bending over? Reaching overhead? Sleeping? Does the pain limit your ability to do PT? 

3. What have you already tried? Tylenol? NSAIDs? PT? Massage? Ice? Heat? Wraps/braces? Opioids? List it all out, along with duration, effectiveness, and reason for stopping. Describe conversations you've had with other doctors about the pain and the outcome of those conversations.

4. What do you want? If you know already that opioids or medical marijuana do it for you, then don't be shy about it. It's okay to have some questions or reservations about them, but it saves everyone time to just ask for what you want. 

Pain is not a given, nor is it normal to just suffer. There's plenty of good drugs &amp; techniques on the market to treat pain and hopefully one of them works for you.",t3_m1cdim,t1_gqdj1hv,2021-03-09 21:26:18,/r/cancer/comments/m1cdim/seeing_pain_management_on_friday_anyone_have_any/gqdj1hv/,,"Seeing pain management on Friday, anyone have any tips on how I can advocate for myself?","Femalw 33, stage 3 breast cancer survivor, Her 2 pos, chemo, radiation and double mastectomy.

sparker420,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_m25tst,1,gqjti5r,"I am so sorry. Firstly I will admit I don’t have much advice but I want you to know you’re not alone. 

I’m in a very similar situation myself. I’m 21, jobless, highly anxious, and my mum has cancer in her liver which has spread to her surrounding organs. She has ascites also, and a tumour is obstructing her bowels meaning she’s unable to keep any food or drink down. A meeting with the palliative care team yesterday revealed she’s only got a few weeks left. She was moved to a palliative care facility today. 

I think your mum is probably aware she doesn’t have a whole lot of time left. I think she might be putting on a brave face to try and keep strong for you. Whether you’d like to tell her the news yourself or not is totally up to you, don’t feel like you’re obligated to do anything you’re not comfortable with. 

As for you, this is the most important time you need to be taking care of yourself. Losing your father and mother is definitely not an easy thing. I would encourage you to turn to your good friends and your brother for support, and maybe even speak with a counsellor. It is incredibly hard to deal with all this on your own. Also make sure you’re focusing on your health, eat 3 times a day and stay hydrated. Your physical health has a massive effect on your mental health. 

Keep your head up and make the most of the time you have left with your mum. Talk about anything you need to say, maybe write a letter if it’s easier. Try to forgive her for what she’s done for your own sake rather than hers. Holding onto that anger will only hurt you in the long run. Be kind to yourself &lt;3",t3_m25tst,t1_gqjti5r,2021-03-11 08:16:58,/r/cancer/comments/m25tst/doctor_told_me_my_mom_doesnt_have_much_longer/gqjti5r/,,Doctor told me my mom doesn't have much longer.,"Hello everyone, first time poster.

I would like to apologize because this post isn't gonna make a whole lot of chronological sense, and that's because i don't have the right information to make it so.

I am 23 years old, unemployed, just finished highschool, in a bad financial situation, and bad situation in general (house falling apart, gas got cut off for lack of payment, i have many untreated mental health issues).

Around 12 days ago i got the news that my mom has breast cancer. She's been sick for about a year now and due to very strained relationship with her, and her personality, she didn't tell me, nor did she tell anyone else, i had to find out because of my mom's friends desperately asking my mom's doctors for info.

She's had ascites, has been drained many times, and three days ago she got a CT scan done, she reacted badly to the contrast and spent all day throwing up what little she could eat and in immense stomach pain. She went to ER, they gave her morphine and now she's about to come back home.

Yesterday, when i went to visit her at the hospital, her doctor pulled me aside and told me that my mom's cancer has spread to other organs (she wasn't very specific and i was too nervous to even speak, so this is all i know for now) and that basically she could pass anytime.

I don't think my mom knows about this because this friday we (me, mom and brother) are going to have a meeting with the oncologist and psychologist, and she's going to be put into palliative care, so i assume the psychologist will tell her the news, but this is where i need help. I know it's only a few days away but my mom is an extremely cheerful, good spirited person, and that makes this situation more difficult, because seeing her so happy, having so much faith that she will recover, and me having to keep this horrible secret inside of me, is going to destroy me, it is destroying me already and i don't know what to do.

My mom might have done a lot of terrible things to me but i can say she's the only one of my parents i love (father passed away when i was a teenager) and since i suffered the death of my father so much, i can't imagine how i'm going to take my mother's death. I'm mostly afraid of suffering health issues because of it because i have such high anxiety and don't take the best care of my health, i don't know how i'm gonna make it, honestly.

Also, since i don't have a job and she gets little money, i'm afraid i won't be able to give her the best quality of life for her remaining days, i would like to give her so much more, but i can't at best assure she gets to eat everyday.

I'm so sorry about this post being a mess and my english not being the best,  hope you can forgive me but i just need to let this out.

Thank you for reading."
WesternTumbleweeds,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_m3fazp,2,gqpl08j,"I'm so sorry. What a terrible time for you and your brothers.So the question is... did you ever have end of life conversations with your mother?  Did she write a living will?  Did you ever talk about  [palliative care and hospice care?](https://www.healthline.com/health/palliative-care-vs-hospice#differences)  
What have the doctors said about her future treatment plan, and have you spoken to them yet?

There's probably a reason why you stayed in the first place --you were the closest to her. However, that doesn't mean that she wants you to fly back, or make any out-of-the-ordinary moves that would disrupt your studies (which are a point of hope and pride for her).  When my mother was dying, she made it VERY clear to me on her deathbed that I wasn't to do any such thing. I was to go back on that plane, and go take care of my small children. It was a tough tough trip home (I cried the whole way), but it was as she wanted and I had to accept she was in good hands with the rest of the family. I thought of her every minute, lit candles and prayers. And when she left, I knew she was free. It doesn't mean it was easy, but I knew I had fulfilled her wishes by taking care of my life.

I think your aunt could be her medical guardian, but only if she's up to it, and only once you've spoken to her about her end of life wishes. Then it's a matter of your aunt carrying those wishes out, and also letting the hospital and the doctors know what they are. You are might want to take a week off, fly back, and just to have this conversation.   And yes, you should make plans with your brothers and make sure they go back too. If the quality of care there is excellent, and she is comfortable with her doctors, and she has her sister there, then maybe that's where she needs to be.",t3_m3fazp,t1_gqpl08j,2021-03-12 17:24:40,/r/cancer/comments/m3fazp/mum_getting_sicker_while_shes_overseas_what_can/gqpl08j/,,Mum getting sicker while she's overseas. What can my siblings and I do?,"Tldr my mum is really unwell, just had a big surgery which we think she will recover from but never certain. She lives abroad and all our family live at home. What's the best action to take?

It's a long one but I need advice and a vent...

Context, my parents are divorced and I (26f) have two brothers 28 and 23. We live in our home country while my mum lives in Asia - has done for years as she worked there. She was planning to finish a contract there in June and return home this year.

Mum has had cancer for a bit over a year now. I lived with her in that country because of covid circumstances for most of 2020, so when she had pain or side effects, I would take care of her, stay with her at the hospital, take her to scans and chemo if she needed my help. Over there she was able to access reportedly quite innovative and effective medicine, the quality of care is great in our opinion, and I've met most of her doctors. 

After 10 months staying there (without a proper visa even) I decided to come back to our home country to pursue study, find somewhere to live, restart my life after the pandemic etc. My mother was pretty well at the time, was staying at home, still doing chemo monthly but generally feeling ok day-to-day. So at the time I thought it was fine to leave (in any case, she was planning to come home too after a few more months).

A couple weeks after I got home (I did a 14-day isolation in a facility too) we heard from our aunt that mum had gotten sicker with some chemo side effects and gone back to hospital to be observed. Since then she has stayed there pretty much. Her plans of travelling back home have been postponed and postponed indefinitely.

Yesterday she had a bigger complication and had to get two major surgeries. Again our aunt was the one who got in touch to tell my brothers and I. While the doctors said it was a successful procedure, things seem to be getting more serious. I think she needs someone there with her or to come back home where we are. I know she absolutely doesn't want to ask any of us to go there, but it's getting to the point of being necessary.

My brothers both work (older bro is a govt employee and younger bro and I are teachers). I've also just started my graduate programme and new job after getting back. Mum knows it would be hard for me to get on a plane and return to her, even so I still feel guilty to say I can't. I don't know if it's ok to expect one of my brothers to step up either. Or one of our aunts? (Her sisters, some of whom live here or in another country).

I'm so worried that something will happen and the doctors there won't know who to contact. At the same time I don't feel emotionally ready to be the first point of contact about her medical situation, that terrifies me if the hospital asked to make some kind of decision. Ultimately, I just want her to be here where we are, but even with the embassy in that country, we weren't able to get her an emergency medical pass before to travel back (she isn't really fit to travel now regardless).

What can I do in this scenario, or what can our family do?"

Living in a different country, I started to worry when the doctors ordered a CT scan and subsequently an MRI, without much communication about her condition. After days of waiting her oncologist finally broke the news that she had stage 4 cancer that had metastasized to the bone, causing innumerable lesions and six fractures along her spine. Two of her ribs had also suffered fractures, with a third one on its way. He immediately ordered a spinal biopsy to locate the primary. However, pathologists haven’t been able to do so (poorly differentiated) and it has been diagnosed as a cancer of unknown primary.

Covid made getting to her really difficult, but I made it here finally. Mom got very weak and blood results showed that she was unfit for more tests and also unfit for chemo or immunotherapy. She went once to radiotherapy. Her bone pain is getting worse by the day. She has been on a syringe driver (Fentanyl) for more than 3 weeks now.

However a week ago she suffered breakthrough pains so often that her palliative doctors ordered Ketamine and Midazolam to be administered through syringe drivers at 3 day intervals. She could finally sleep after the extra pain meds, but as soon as she got off it - hell. Her breathing is also impaired because of her ascites from liver cirrhosis. 2 days ago the fluid was drained and she is breathing much better now, we have also checked into a hospice where she is receiving better palliative care. By “we” I really mean that WE have checked into a hospice. I’m by moms bedside 12 hours a day. Home hospice was not an option extended to us, given how the tumors have eroded her core bones.

She seems much more herself these days but it’s really been up and down. One moment she’s laughing and joking but 5 minutes later she’s moaning in her sleep. It’s also really taken a toll on me and dad, both physically and emotionally. I love my mom so much and want her to be happy and pain-free for as long as possible, but at the same time it has also been really difficult not knowing when the inevitable will occur and when this horrible time will finally come to an end. I feel guilty for even thinking those thoughts.

Every day I wake up in shock realizing where I am and knowing that mom is at the hospice waiting for me to come to her. Either that or I wake up in shock from a text that she’s hurting somewhere. Lack of sleep has also been causing really dry and painful eyes, making the day-to-day routine difficult. How did everyone deal with the uncertainty of not knowing how much time is left exactly?

I really need to be present and strong for mom right now so she has all the assurance she needs, but I feel myself really breaking down."
djriri228,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_gqs2n0x,5,gqs6hj4,I’m really sorry that it does look like you’re relapsing. I don’t know where your original cancer was but from your scans it does look like you at least had some liver involvement and I know of at least one clinical trial that is being done for it as my mum was supposed to be doing it when her cancer relapsed. Also see if they will refer you to a palliative care/pain management specialist to get your pain under control. I’m sorry your having trouble getting a hold of your dr in my experience I always had better luck either hounding the dr’s secretary or physician’s assistant and if you feel like your dr isn’t interested in helping you advocate for a new one. I know it’s frustrating and tiring but sometimes advocating for yourself is the only way Crap gets done. I’ll keep my fingers crossed that you get some answers ASAP and a plan in place and in the meantime I hope you find something that will give you some pain relief.

Unfortunately the chemo, immunotherapy and radiation were doing nothing to slow the growth of what was an aggressive lung cancer, but we were able to keep my father comfortable at home with oxycodone and MS Contin. 

While treatment can hopefully help your father, you can also meet with palliative care to ensure his pain continues to be well-managed. The palliative care team was so caring and also helped my father get prescriptions to stimulate his appetite and help with his diagnosis-related depression.

He recently got the transplant December 2020. Everything was going well and he was feeling more like his “normal” self after a couple weeks. He was still being seen twice a week for labs/check ups and the Dr was taking him off medications as he was doing better. 

He just reached his 100 day post transplant mark and had no rejection to the transplant so it was good news to celebrate. These past weeks have been fun and much needed.

Maybe there is someone similar you can talk to about your mother's care instead of taking my advice on the Internet. But what they told me is that the cancer burns a ton of the calories, and the amount that she eats won't make that much difference in the long run. Also, the cancer can make it hard for her body to process food, so eating can be uncomfortable (and less effective). It's natural to want to feed your loved ones, but this might not be the best way to help her right now.

I know that's hard to accept, so some practical advice: Ensure Enlive with a straw (bypasses tasting it as much).

My mum is in final stages of her uterine cancer we are no longer having any chemo it’s just palliative care . 

On her second (and last ) chemo cycle she reacted very badly and had a UTI. This resulted in lots of issues which have resulted in her personality drastically changing . 

She has gone from a mild mannered , friendly person to a angry , combative , confused and panicky person . 

Her health care has been disjointed and a mix of private and NhS (we are in uk). 

She has panics 5 times a day and we are constantly fire fighting . Ambulances get called , she’s in and out of hospital all the time . 

The doctors can’t seem to reverse her mental state back to what it was . She had this same issue a year ago and an endocrinologist fixed it by fluid reduction to raise her sodium . But this time nothing is working . 

Has anyone else experienced this . And what should I expect ? It’s so hard to care for her because she falls out with all the carers and nurses and thinks we are all plotting against her . 

She becomes quite manic at times and is angry so much. She always says she isn’t being fed or given medicine or showers but I know she is or in fact she refuses it a lot of the time so it’s so hard . 

I just wanted to know it’s not just me in this hell I feel I’m in a night mare with a tyrant . I love my mum to death it’s only me and her and has always been like that. But I can’t handle this it’s breaking me apart.

lord_ive,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_m7b23h,2,grbq2cy,"So, if immunotherapy is an option for the cancer, then it may have good results that are durable. For perspective, I am an almost 3 year metastatic melanoma patient with more than a dozen lesions in my brain, and I have good quality of life. However, present immunotherapy treatments are only suitable to treat some cancers, may have less efficacy in the brain, and the side effects, as was in my case, can be brutal and can in fact kill in the worse cases.

For my case, if my cancer progresses, I have two further treatment choices - first, there is a second therapy available for me which will likely work for several months, and after that, whole-brain radiation, which will stop progression for a little while but also has side effects. After that is palliative care, which focuses on keeping the patient as comfortable as possible.

If I were you (I’m not a doctor, just somewhat informed), I’d ask the doctor what the treatment options and side effects would be, and whether quality of life would improve or decline with the stresses of treatment and biopsy. You may have to choose between less time in better health, or more time in worse health, which is a very difficult choice but is worth thinking about now rather than when you’re in the midst of things and not able to make a clear decision.

This is a really hard situation to be in - I’m truly sorry.

Living in a different country, I started to worry when the doctors ordered a CT scan and subsequently an MRI, without much communication about her condition. After days of waiting her oncologist finally broke the news that she had stage 4 cancer that had metastasized to the bone, causing innumerable lesions and six fractures along her spine. Two of her ribs had also suffered fractures, with a third one on its way. He immediately ordered a spinal biopsy to locate the primary. However, pathologists haven’t been able to do so (poorly differentiated) and it has been diagnosed as a cancer of unknown primary.

Covid made getting to her really difficult, but I made it here finally. Mom got very weak and blood results showed that she was unfit for more tests and also unfit for chemo or immunotherapy. She went once to radiotherapy. Her bone pain is getting worse by the day. She has been on a syringe driver (Fentanyl) for more than 3 weeks now.

However a week ago she suffered breakthrough pains so often that her palliative doctors ordered Ketamine and Midazolam to be administered through syringe drivers at 3 day intervals. She could finally sleep after the extra pain meds, but as soon as she got off it - hell. Her breathing is also impaired because of her ascites from liver cirrhosis. 2 days ago the fluid was drained and she is breathing much better now, we have also checked into a hospice where she is receiving better palliative care. By “we” I really mean that WE have checked into a hospice. I’m by moms bedside 12 hours a day. Home hospice was not an option extended to us, given how the tumors have eroded her core bones.

She seems much more herself these days but it’s really been up and down. One moment she’s laughing and joking but 5 minutes later she’s moaning in her sleep. It’s also really taken a toll on me and dad, both physically and emotionally. I love my mom so much and want her to be happy and pain-free for as long as possible, but at the same time it has also been really difficult not knowing when the inevitable will occur and when this horrible time will finally come to an end. I feel guilty for even thinking those thoughts.

Every day I wake up in shock realizing where I am and knowing that mom is at the hospice waiting for me to come to her. Either that or I wake up in shock from a text that she’s hurting somewhere. Lack of sleep has also been causing really dry and painful eyes, making the day-to-day routine difficult. How did everyone deal with the uncertainty of not knowing how much time is left exactly?

I really need to be present and strong for mom right now so she has all the assurance she needs, but I feel myself really breaking down."

djriri228,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_mcgrx7,2,gs565b6,Ok so I will tell you my mums experience if that will help. Obviously her cancer of origin isn’t the same she was diagnosed with adenoidal cystic sarcoma but when she relapsed 4 months after the all clear it was in her cervical spine that it showed up first and she did three high dose radiation treatments to shrink it which it did but it didn’t eradicate it and chemo was never an option for my mums cancer. The days following her treatments were very painful but once she was prescribed steroids they worked wonders for the pain caused by the treatments these were done in March 2019 around august she had a procedure to put some sort of cement into the spine to help strengthen it because it was getting crumbly and one further radiation treatment and around the same time they found a small met on her femur that they weren’t worried about and only occasionally ached between then and July 2020 there wasn’t too much growth though she had been hospitalised in November 2019 with septic pneumonia and it really weakened her and she was progressively losing weight. July 2020 she was hospitalised again with pneumonia after being found unresponsive and they could see mets at the top of her skull but again weren’t to worried as it was the thickest bone area and spent about 2 weeks in before doing a few weeks in a rehabilitation hospital to help her gain back some strength but she was getting weaker quickly and was found unresponsive again end of October and her cancer had just gone crazy. She had a tumour about the size of a plum in her brain that had developed from her skull met and it was causing seizures that they were having trouble controlling they also found cancer in her lung and another bit in her pelvis. And she passed on the 20th of November while we were trying to sort out home hospice care. She said other than after treatments it wasn’t all that painful and treated her pain with steroids when needed gabapentin and she was prescribed medical marijuana which really helped with the back stuff and to sleep comfortably. She was prescribed a stronger morphine but she rarely used it as she didn’t like how it made her feel. So she got about 20 months from relapse to when she passed. I know there is a clinical trial immunotherapy for patients with thyroid cancer. Anyway first I’m really sorry about your mum and hope whatever she decides that you guys get some good quality time together. And I hope that the doctors will give you some answers as I know they aren’t always that forthcoming. My mum was told that though her cancer had a pretty high reoccurrence rate that it was slow growing and it would be probably 5-10 years before that happened and we didn’t find out till her final hospitalisation that her cancer had a very rare mutation that gave her like a 3 year life expectancy from initial diagnosis and I’m still a bit salty that they knew that a minimum of 12 months before she passed but didn’t tell us. Make sure your mum has a good palliative care team as they are good resources for tons of stuff. Also get a handle on any weight loss sooner rather than later. Anyway I hope at least something in my wall of text is of some help and wish you and your family all the best at this horrible time.,t3_mcgrx7,t1_gs565b6,2021-03-25 06:32:28,/r/cancer/comments/mcgrx7/i_just_want_a_doctor_to_give_it_to_us_straight/gs565b6/,,"I just want a doctor to give it to us straight, without the BS.",[deleted]

my wife, 43, has metastatic lung cancer.  she was diagnosed about a year ago after experiencing consistent pain on her right side when trying to sleep.  i remember the night she called me to say she was in pain and having trouble sleeping.  i remember it well bc she's always sleeping around 930p and the call came to me around 11pm while i was still working.  i remember thinking ""oh shit whats going on""... 

5-ish years before that night, she has some melanoma removed from her skin and lymph nodes. she healed and went every 6 months for chest x-rays and they were ""all clear"".  we lived our lives knowing that could've been worse.  well...

fast fwd to today and she's been fighting hard but w/out luck.  the opdivo / yervoy didnt work and gave her terrible head pressure as a side effect. the keytruda didnt work and gave her terrible colitis. the braf / mektovi pills didn't work and the chemo isn't working either.  the tumor in her lung is now larger than a softball.  she isn't sleeping well due to the constant pain.  she can barely walk w/out being out of breathe and the fentanyl patch makes her puke so she doesn't like using it. 

it seems like there's bad luck at every turn.  :/ the tough part for me is that she is such a good person. loves nature, the sea, all animals and of course people.  she's one who keeps mostly to herself, doesn't smoke, drink or do any drugs.  all we ever really wanted was to work hard and enjoy living our lives together. 

it's really hard to get any concrete info from doctors. if i was here to rant, id prob say something mean about them in hopes it'd make me feel better. but it won't and i am not here for that... i want to believe they're doing their best.

**so, question**: how does this play out? i'm unsure if there's a playbook for this but wanted to ask anyways. does the pain end up being the killer? or is there something else in her body that will give out (e.g. heart)?  i'm not looking for a crystal ball but am hoping others who have faced similar can share experiences.

She knows she won’t last long, but she insists on the long, hard road.  So I respect it, do what needs to be done and play my part.

When she’s hungry, I get her what she wants.  When she’s angry, I shut up and listen.  When she’s weak, I walk her from A to B.

NikolitaNiko,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_mcr2qj,2,gs9al02,"I'm not sure if this is the type of answer you are looking for. If it's not, I apologize in advance.

I'm so sorry for what you and your wife are having to deal with. It's so hard to watch our loved ones be in pain and be limited in what you can do to help.

I'm a widow, 5 years out. In late 2015 my SO (31M) died from stage 4 melanoma that had metastasized all over his upper body and head. He had been diagnosed as stage 1 either shortly before or after we broke up in 2013, and then had about a 1.5 year gap after he had the mole removed before his cancer returned as stage 3. We had gotten back together by this point, and then I was with him from mid-2014 until the his death at the end of 2015.

His melanoma was very, very aggressive. He went from being diagnosed as stage 3 to dying within the span of a year. He was diagnosed as stage 4 about 6 weeks before his death. Very fast.

So I will answer your question as best I can, just keep in mind that my experience is with a very aggressive cancer.

\-----

Of the last 6 weeks of his life, he was lucid and coherent for about the first 4 weeks, roughly. He had pain in parts of his body from where the cancer was, basically, eating away at him because it was so widespread. It was in his skin, organs, bones, lymph nodes.

He tried nivolumab a couple of times, but the decision was made to discontinue it due to quality of life issues despite the fact that it \*was\* shrinking his cancer. They gave him Zofran to combat the nausea but it made him severely constipated, and the focus became trying to treat that. Meanwhile he just got sicker because the cancer was moving so quickly. He never did become strong enough to try another treatment.

After about 4 weeks we could see that he was starting to become a little incoherent in his speech. There would be pauses in his speech, or he might say something that didn't make a whole lot sense. He had more difficulty concentrating. He started eating less. He was given Boost drinks to help with nutrition but he stopped wanting to drink them. He was on an IV for hydration.

One of the last semi-coherent conversations I remember hearing him have was his doctor asking him how he wanted to die. We got one coherent answer out of him, and then the rest of what he was saying didn't make a whole lot of sense. The last gesture of recognition I recall ever having from him was a wink.

Shortly after that he became unable to recognize some people, in particular me. He seemed to remember his parents, but he didn't know who I was anymore. He would get up and try to walk around, and I'd have to rush behind him with his IV pole because he didn't want to have it on him. He'd walk around the ward aimlessly; once he tried to get on an elevator. Thankfully he listened to the nurses and they would help get him back to his room, but he no longer responded to me.

With the confusion and lack of coherence also came the eventual zoning out. He would spend hours just staring at the wall, his pupils wide and his eyes empty. I tried getting prints made but wasn't able to get them ready in time; his father ended up buying a decorative hanging wall scroll of some birds for him to look at so he wasn't just staring at the wall.

After that he stopped moving much, aside from to try to go to the bathroom. When he became unable to control his bodily functions, they gave him a catheter and he was confined to his bed. I remember that even in his confusion, he didn't want the catheter and he used to fight his mom and I to try to take it out. He stopped being able to eat solid foods by this point. I recall that near the end his dad was still trying to feed him some solid foods (like a banana or some other fruit), but after he was vomiting the doctor basically told him that it wasn't helping and he needed to stop.

Not long before his death we managed to get half an MRI done, and they told us that the cancer had metastasized to his brain. It was consuming the lining of his brain and parts of his brain (stem?) that controlled bodily functions like eating, using the bathroom, speaking, etc. As the cancer progressed, that's why he was unable to do these things anymore. It's also why he was unable to recognize me.

For pain relief, I don't remember all the details. Before he went into the hospital for the last time, at home they'd been giving him low dose morphine pills, but he had a psychological aversion to them. Once he went into the hospital, I don't remember if they were giving him pain relief via the IV or if they were still trying the morphine pills for awhile.

He was on an IV until either the day before/the morning of his death, when they removed it and also stopped all forms of nutrition.

So to answer your question, in my SO's case, the cancer is what killed him. Although at the very, very end, when his parents were unable to be with him in their grief and I was sitting with him, I was working with his nurses to manage his medications. The morning he died I think he had some kind of seizure or stroke, after which point he developed the ""death rattle"" in his throat. We were giving him medications to try to calm his breathing (he was completely gone at this point, just a shell). Although the nurses were compassionate and said that the medicines they/we gave him helped him relax enough to die, I have always had the suspicion that we just slowed his breathing to the point where his body stopped his breathing function (with the aid of the medications).

My SO's parents are divorced and both are relatively low-income, so they were only able to be with him at the end. Therefore when they were not able to be there, I was the support, the caretaker, the scribe, etc. So the nurses on the palliative ward dealt with me, as did his doctor. I asked them to be straight up with me always; I would rather know and make more informed decisions than to not know at all. Some of the nurses would let me see his file notes, whereas a couple others were stricter and said that wasn't allowed (so I was always careful to not out the other nurses who did allow me that privilege).

One of my favourite nurses told me about 2 weeks before he died, straight out upon my asking, that yes he was going to die. So I ""knew"" before his family came to that acceptance/realization on their own. It was a double-edged sword though, as on one hand I knew so I could sort of prepare and cope better, but on the other hand I was so traumatized by dealing with this more or less alone that I was shoving everything down into a mental box. I'm a social worker and I remember one of his nurses asking me if I was showing \[x\] behavior as his partner or his social worker, and I said both. I don't remember the specific context behind that comment though.

Also, I don't know where you live, but something that might exist where you are is some kind of paid caretaker leave, either through your government or workplace. I worked nights my SO was sick, so I'd be working at night, with him at the hospital during the day/sleeping sometimes, and then would go home once a day to feed my cats and see them for a bit. I had no idea that PAID leave existed through my provincial government (I think?) until like 2 years after he died. I went on unpaid leave from my retail job starting a few days before he died, and was gone for 5 weeks. I think I got 3 days' paid compensation from work but that was it. I was so mad because if I'd known that actual paid leave had existed, I would of course have taken it instead of trying to juggle being with him and paying for a roof over my head.

5-ish years before that night, she has some melanoma removed from her skin and lymph nodes. she healed and went every 6 months for chest x-rays and they were ""all clear"".  we lived our lives knowing that could've been worse.  well...

fast fwd to today and she's been fighting hard but w/out luck.  the opdivo / yervoy didnt work and gave her terrible head pressure as a side effect. the keytruda didnt work and gave her terrible colitis. the braf / mektovi pills didn't work and the chemo isn't working either.  the tumor in her lung is now larger than a softball.  she isn't sleeping well due to the constant pain.  she can barely walk w/out being out of breathe and the fentanyl patch makes her puke so she doesn't like using it.

ejscarpa91,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_gs9mdhi,1,gsf1dh4,"Hi again. I hope that the pleur-x catheter placement went well. Cancers in the lung can produce cancerous fluid that can fill the lung and make it very difficult to breathe. But clearly you and your wife are already aware of this.  I’m thankful that the drain was/will be placed and can easily relieve some of  your wife’s discomfort, not to mention some of your anxiety and worry over her well-being and what you can do to help. In the home-setting, draining is usually performed for symptom relief ie when your wife is short of breath and using more oxygen/hungry for air. The hospice nurse will likely perform a draining and then show you how to perform one yourself, if you’re comfortable. This is a more realistic outcome because you don’t typically receive 24-hr/daily hospice or visiting nursing privileges but will have a nurse on call if you need help or have questions. 

I’m hopeful that palliative radiation to shrink the mass is successful and that your wife finds some relief from it. If she has an appetite, try to coax some high protein snacks Into her to help her skin and body heal after the radiation. We also recommend Sarna lotion to our patients if radiation burn occurs.

I wanted to see if anyone has knowledge or experience with chemo brain and/or dementia. Lately, my mom seems to be slipping mentally (forgetful, out of it, not grasping concepts at times). I can't tell if this is just chemo brain or if she's starting to show signs of dementia.

A few notes:
-Her last chemo treatment was January 6th (it put her in the hospital so the doctor suspended treatment)
-She is basically bed-ridden, so she sleeps a lot during the day and doesn't do much
-She's pretty dehydrated, so she's on hydration treatment. She also doesn't eat much
-Her mother had dementia in her 80's. My mom will be 70 this year

I guess I’m a little frustrated because I had a hard time falling asleep for the last week or so because I couldn’t find a comfortable position because of the pain, and she prescribed another NSAID.

Bluedyeblues,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_mo8xeq,3,gu3cr91,"I have the same diagnosis and just wrapped up treatment three weeks ago. 

Outpatient is the way to go. I did half in and half out, so take my word for it. 

I also had a PICC for my first round then a port for the rest. A port is waaay easier, definitely ask if you can get one. The downside is that it will likely stay in longer, weeks/months after you stop treatment. 

As far as side effects, as one fellow cancer patient put it, welcome to the buffet. They have drugs for everything. I had a separate appointment with palliative care, who helped immensely with my side effects. The symptoms of the cancer started to get better as soon as I started treatment and went away completely after the second round. Definitely consider medical marijuana. I was against because I have a young baby and didn't want to be high, but it ended up helping me when nothing else would. 

Be ready for the Neulasta pain, for me it was the worst part of treatment. Claritin helps many but not all.

Pooping will become an event. Besides what they prescribe, I recommend a squatty potty and Tucks pads. 

I highly recommend a therapist. Cancer is traumatic and it's really helpful to check in with yourself as you go through it. 

You'll get a lot of blood draws. The veins in your arms may not make it, be prepared for them to draw from your hands. 

My hair started falling out in the first round. It came out in gobs. It's hard to count how many times a day you touch your hair until every time you do it a chunk of hair comes with it. It felt like a tooth suddenly falling out. I ended up shaving it off after a few days. I never totally went bald, but what I had stopped growing except for four little hairs on the nape of my neck. The back and sides are okay, the top has a big smooth bald spot. Most of my body hair has fallen out, including most of my eyebrows. I'm prepared that I'll need to keep using head coverings for a few months after the end of treatment. I prefer thin chemo caps and scarves, I found wigs to be very hot and uncomfortable. 

Honestly, I was terrified of chemo going in. I thought I would become this gaunt, shiveled up shell of myself, in constant pain and throwing up all the time. It wasn't like that. I definitely had a couple days each cycle where I couldn't move around much (see: Neulasta), and I threw up a few times, but it was never unbearable, especially with the drugs. Mostly I watched a lot of TV and got really into TikTok. I was afraid I would just fall down and die, but I did it, and you can, too.",t3_mo8xeq,t1_gu3cr91,2021-04-10 23:16:35,/r/cancer/comments/mo8xeq/tips_starting_repoch_on_monday/gu3cr91/,,Tips?

They found some “lesions” on her liver, biopsied, and only today we got the final word - stage 4 liver cancer.

She has already fought and won the battle against breast cancer. That was terrifying, but there was at least hope. Right now, I don’t think it has completely sunk in but my mother is laying in hospital dying right now. 

I can’t even go visit her due to COVID, and the brief phone calls I’ve been able to have with her are heartbreaking. She can barely talk because of the pain and medication. 

I’ve not handled this well, naturally. My emotions are all over the place. I’m trying to keep myself together so I can support her and my family. 

Right now I’m scared I won’t see her again. I don’t know much, the only source of information I have is my father who has been seeing the doctors. 

She’s young, in her 50s. And like many who have been in this situation I already regret so many things. All I hope right now is that she can be herself again even just for a little while.. it’s kind of selfish, I guess. I just want to spend some time with her again. She may only have months left. 

I’d love for someone to tell me otherwise but my understanding is that once the liver gets involved things are pretty grim. I really wish I knew more about what is going on. 

A few weeks ago, even before she went into hospital, she was in pain but seemed fine. I didn’t even think much of her going in, I thought they were just going to run some tests and things. She would be out in a few days, tops.

You know things are getting serious when the neighbors start dropping off care packages. That happened today and I nearly broke down. I’m grateful to live in a good community. But to me that’s what made it kind of real.

I wasn’t the easiest child to raise. I was troublesome and rebellious, a constant source of worry and grief for my parents.  I just hope she’s proud of me now. I couldn’t have become the person I am today without her. Through blood sweat and tears, she kept me from going too far down the wrong path. I just can’t help feel like I am partly responsible for her poor health.

The doctor wouldn't offer chemo if he wasn't physically strong enough for it. Being strong enough is a good sign, and it means he has a choice (instead of no choice!). When you're faced with a diagnosis like this, you have to consider not just the quantity of the rest of your life, but also the quality. Intensive treatment will mean a long period of reduced quality of life, in the hope that it can result in remission and a long period of recovery and normal quality of life again. But there's a risk that it won't result in remission or that the remission period won't be that long.

Having been through chemo and radiation therapy know the toll it can take on the body. But hey I got better, so it was worth it. But iff you are not going to get better then all these procedures are simply extending the suffering. I strongly recommend hospice and palliative care so the focus is on reducing the pain instead of trying to ""fix"" the problem.",t3_na67xt,t1_gxs5bbk,2021-05-11 21:48:05,/r/cancer/comments/na67xt/euthanasia/gxs5bbk/,,Euthanasia,"Hello everyone! 

I’m sorry if this is extremely gloomy but I can’t think of anywhere else to ask. 

I’m 27F terminal with metastatic BC spread to the skeleton. I’ve been diagnosed for a little under a year. So far I’m still working full time and managing the side effects of my meds pretty well. However twice now my treatment plan has failed to show significant progress which means I’m headed towards heavy chemo and radiation. 

In turn, I know what’s coming, and it ain’t pretty. 

To be honest I don’t really ever want to experience what a “collapsed spine” or “severe bone pain” feels like. I’d rather die as my own, vibrant self, before I’m reduced to a woman who can no longer walk or properly take care of herself. 

At first I thought I’d get lots of illegal drugs and head off deep into the woods, have a major trip and then pass out peacefully in the dewy moss and never wake up again. But then I also want to give my family an opportunity to partake in my life ending and I don’t want to rob them of an opportunity to grieve or process. After all they’re the ones stuck with the loss of me, and I get to pass on in peace. 

Has anyone of you had any experience with euthanasia? I live in Europe so I can have this done in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Portugal or Belgium. I’m not a citizen of either of these countries but I have sufficient funds to stay in any of these countries for as long as investigation might take. I’ve done extensive research on the process of this and I know what it’s about and the potential hardships that might come with it. 

I just really don’t want to die being a shell of myself. I want to LIVE as long as I live, and I want to die with dignity. I know I might live on for years and that this cancer fucking shit is very unpredictable, but I’m a planner and I like to plan. 

I would highly appreciate any experiences, advice or thoughts. 

Love you guys, you’re the best."

Being with her in the hospital, seeing her hooked up to machines and a catheter, pleading ""I want to go home"" over and over. That was unbearable, so we decided on palliative care in as familiar-as-possible surroundings.

Tell them you want a consultation for a second opinion but, he's very ill. Sometimes a Dr can have a second office or refer you to someone closer as well like a nurse practitioner.  Get copies of everything you can and give them to the dr to review. They may be able to give an opinion on just the reports alone. 


Some cancer organizations can help you understand and go through your records with you. Usually just a nurse but it can give you better insights.

Hospice can be used up to a year in the united states typically. Id look into it because even if he gets treatment they may still help you care for him. A Palliative care dr is another you may wish to look into. They focus on pain management and quality of life treatment options.

My dad was diagnosed with bladder cancer last week. He had a biopsy where they also removed 90% of the tumor. This week he had to go back to the hospital because he was having kidney issues. They were going to do a surgery to remove a blockage of kidney. Then we heard his kidneys were much better, so the surgery wasn’t needed and he just needed to get chemo and radiation ASAP. Then within an hour his oncologist came in and told him it’s very aggressive stage 4 and he has the choice of chemo, which can maybe prolong his life three months, or hospice. We still don’t really get what happened. Just on Sunday, he was eating and himself. Now they’re saying he will die soon and we have no options at all. We don’t understand what he is even diagnosed with (beyond bladder cancer). They didn’t do a pet scan. 

We want a second opinion. But how do we do this? At this point he is in poor shape, and can’t eat or drink on his own. He lives in a more rural place with just one hospital, but if we can get him up to a bigger city (Denver or Colorado Springs)... I don’t know it might be hopeless.

He was initially diagnosed with left parotid gland cancer, which a year later progressed into lung cancer. After almost an year of chemotherapy his pet scan revealed almost negligible cancer cells near lungs area but had progressed greatly in his brain and spinal cord. He initially had pain near his left pelvis, then headache and now vomiting every other day. He has lost his ability to walk due to leg paralysis. Now he spends his days mostly sleeping. We wake him up at the time of eating and try to make him talk or laugh as much as we can. He usually doesn’t responds. He has started behaving like this from a week before. He can’t pass stool by himself and has catheterisation for urine. I now this the end of road for him, what I want to know is how and when is it going to happen? Do the paralysis grows to his upper body or will it be some other way? Is there anything that we can do to make it easier for him?

Edit: I wanted to complete this post. My dad passed away 10 days after his above mentioned condition. In his last few days, his diet became almost negligible, he stopped talking and won’t recognise anyone except my mom. On his last day, his oxygen saturation started dropping until he started taking deeper breaths and until he stopped. It was slow and painless. 
To anyone who came here for advice: talk as much as possible with your loved ones. Tell them stories, show them old pictures, fight for the last smile you can scorch out of them. People say hearing is the last sensation to go, I tried to play his favourite songs in his last days. Let them know how much you love them, and in the end remember you truly loved them."

schoobydoo42,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_nr9rrm,5,h0hi9zm,"First off, you are absolutely not failing. You are taking care of a very sick person and doing your very best. You mentioned that she has palliative care nurses. Does she have a palliative care physician? I ask because a person who has Stage 4 cancer as well as multiple other medical problems needs to be having a discussion with you (her caregiver) and her medical team about what her goals of care are. Meaning, how aggressive does she want her treatment to be, if her prognosis isn't good? These are hard conversations, but knowing what her goals are can help you and her medical team determine when she needs to go to the hospital. 

Even as a doctor myself, when I was undergoing chemo, I had trouble determining when to go to the ER or call the nurse line for new symptoms. There's not always a right answer. Even her doctors can't tell you for certain that a new symptom is going to be fine or that it's definitely bad--sometimes they can, but it's not always straightforward even for doctors. It's their job to help guide you, but these are hard decisions with a lot of gray area. When in doubt, they're always going to tell you to go to the ER if you think it's serious. And, in terms of communication, do remember that they have hundreds of other patients and are busy in clinic most days, so understand why it takes them some time to respond to your questions.

It may help to bring a list of the most common scenarios that you have encountered when caring for this person. Such as--low blood pressure: how low is too low? what are some things I can do at home to help treat this before bringing her in? shortness of breath: how long can I give it before taking her to the hospital? what are some warning signs to watch out for that she needs to go in right away? and also, what are symptoms that I should expect to see with her illness that wouldn't be concerning?

You may not get perfect answers, but it might help. Wish you the very best in your caregiving role.",t3_nr9rrm,t1_h0hi9zm,2021-06-03 20:53:53,/r/cancer/comments/nr9rrm/communication_with_healthcare_team/h0hi9zm/,,Communication with Healthcare Team,"I’m a primary caregiver for a stage 4 melanoma patient who had many preexisting conditions before the cancer diagnosis.  She was diagnosed with melanoma metastatic to the lungs and liver a month ago and started immunotherapy last week and new heart medications last month. The biggest obstacle I’ve encountered as a caregiver thus far is that I call and email her oncologist and her cardiologist about worrisome new symptoms (loss of vision, shortness of breath, very low blood pressure, high pulse) and they often don’t get back to me for 1-2 days.  Once I waited a full day just for a nurse to call and tell me to take her to the hospital.  I have spoken to both doctors about the problems with communication and asked about the best way to reach them, and they always tell me to call and leave a message or send emails.  They assure me they will get back to me sooner next time; however it just doesn’t happen. 

So far the delays haven’t caused much harm that I can discern except that she’s been uncomfortable and anxious for longer than necessary.  However, I worry about a serious situation arising. With all of her existing medical conditions and symptoms, it is difficult for me to discern when I should take her to the hospital without medical advice. I have tried to ask questions like, “when should I take her to the hospital?  What symptoms should I watch for?”  They just tell me to take her to the hospital if I think it’s an emergency and to call otherwise. I doubt my ability to assess that when her baseline health is so poor. 

Additionally it seems like I need to remind every doctor of details of her medications, medical history, etc every time that we speak. Sometimes after I mention something, they change their recommendation. I worry that at some point I will not realize that a piece of information is important to a conversation and a mistake will be made.  Another problem has been palliative care nurses giving advice like, “give her cranberry juice” when cranberry juice is specifically contraindicated with one of her medications.  I’m very anxious about all of this. 

Does anyone have any advice?  Is this typical?  How do you cope with it?  Are my fears unfounded?  I’m feeling like I’m failing in this role and don’t know how to do better."

Attorney_at_Claw,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_nyddos,2,h1n9jkb,"I had Fibrolamellar Carcinoma until it was successfully resected with clean margins on January 7th of this year. It was a 2.5 year long struggle from initial symptoms to diagnosis, and it almost certainly would have resulted in a medical malpractice suit if my surgery wasn’t successful. Fibrolamellar Carcinoma is currently only successfully treated with resection, so no chemo or other interventional treatments are known with any meaningful benefit. if it had metastasized, there would be very little to do for me outside of palliative care, as you can continue to remove the liver but not things like your lungs or stomach. 

I first got a CT in June 2018 at a local hospital after feeling sharp pains in my abdomen (my tumor pressing on my stomach). Although the radiologist noted it as “mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with unknown etiology,” she nevertheless didn’t order any followup testing and said my liver was “within normal limits.” The tumor was the size of a golf ball then, and it expanded to approximately the size of an NFL football by the time it was removed. It was specifically a pT3N0M0 at removal, and only T3 because T4 requires metastasis plus a certain size; I was T4 in size but T3 due to no metastases.

I had vomiting, lack of energy, and great sensitivity to any pressure on my abdomen as I continued to lose weight (couldn’t keep food down). I went to a gastroenterologist, and after two upper endoscopies and a colonoscopy, he said I was depressed and told me to see a psychiatrist. Had he ever ordered my hospital records and reviewed them, maybe he would have seen the tumor, but he didn’t. I know that because I had to send four separate requests for my patient file before they finally gave it to me, and it was replete with errors.

I then got a primary care doctor involved, and she ordered a whole bunch of blood, urine, and stool tests to see what’s going on. Unfortunately, my cancer being so rare, there are no known markers in any of those tests that would clearly indicate my tumor is growing. However, something was clearly off with all my high and low values in my blood work.

It wasn’t until I was throwing up blood and had lost about 80 pounds that I decided to go to the ER for the blood in my vomit. They ran an ultrasound and CT test to find my tumor had grown, and then after subsequent MRI and fine needle aspiration biopsy that they concluded it was Fibrolamellar Carcinoma. I was the main subject of my hospital’s “tumor board” that day, trying to determine why it had so long to grow.

I share this story only to say you’re not alone in pursuing your symptoms. Doctors go through a hell of a lot to be the professionals that generally help people, but any human can make mistakes, especially if your cancer is one of the rare ones like mine. All I can say is continue to seek treatment and demand diagnostic images if you’re not satisfied with the answers you’re getting. You are your own best advocate.

I seem to be having a difficult time lately composing my thoughts. I’m a 36 year old male who was diagnosed in February 2021 with stage 4 “double hit” diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 

After my diagnosis in early February that kicked off what was to be a the beginning of 8 week hospital stay including 3 weeks in the ICU as the tumours on my kidneys had grown so large they were putting me into full blown renal failure. During my stay I was unable to visit with my family due to the hospitals COVID-19 policy, this left me feeling very alone and isolated. Meanwhile during all of this my pregnant wife was left at home to care for 2 year old toddler by herself all while trying to manage working full time as well, it was a lot on her but unfortunately the bills don’t stop just because your spouse gets sick. 

Since my diagnosis I’ve undergone 5 rounds of chemotherapy with 3 more still scheduled. Each round consists of being hooked to a CADD pump and having the chemo infusion run in over 23 hours a day for 4 days straight. This leaves me feeling absolutely drained and frankly beat up after every round. It makes chasing after a toddler very difficult to say the least. I try my best to push through it but it’s difficult and I don’t want to put any additional stress on my wife as she already done so much since we started on this journey. 

Unfortunately my prognosis could be better I was given a 5 year survival rate of 50%. I know it could be worse and I do have some reason to be optimistic, my last CT scan showed significant shrinking in the size of the tumours so that would lead one to assume the treatments are working regardless of how awful they make me feel. 

This brings me to my question. How do a stay strong for my young family in the face of all of this? The prognosis? The chemo side effects?My wife has been a rock through it all but I can tell it’s starting to get to her as well. I always thought of myself as a mentally strong person, a mind over matter type. But even my mental health has taken a hit since I first was first told I have cancer."

Fast forward to now &amp; the ULMS has spread to my liver and lungs.

I went in for a routine hysterectomy due to a large fibroid tumor (very common and benign uterine mass). I chose a gyn surgeon who specialized in fibroids. He ordered an MRI, but was sure that this was a routine fibroid.

When I awoke from surgery, I was told that they found cancer and that it was also impacting my bowels, which meant that I unexpectedly woke up with an ileostomy. Talk about shocking and traumatic. 

They also found I had suspicious tumors closer to my breastbone and diaphragm. I went in for a CT scan that showed nodules on my lungs but my oncologist wasn’t super concerned. I haven’t been told a stage, but this has to be 3 or 4. It’s high grade, so aggressive. I don’t know how much I want to know, though. The thing screwing with my mind is that aside from heavy periods, there was nothing wrong. I still feel totally fine except minor surgery soreness.

I’m still waiting for a second and third opinion consult with Mayo Clinic and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, but my original oncologist guessed either I would have a major abdominal surgery, chemo/radiation, hormone therapy or a combination. 

So, here’s the bottom line. I had no idea there was anything from with me but fibroids. No clue whatsoever. I went to my routine GYN appointments. I went to the doctor when I was sick. My blood tests were all normal. I don’t know how or if I could have caught this sooner.

I’m feeling really good—like I can beat this and move on, but I need support. Please pray for me."

I'm still on palliative chemo (getting juiced as I type!) and more specifically FOLFOX. FOLFOX does not work on Pseudomyxoma Peritonei but for whatever reason it has worked slightly on me in so far that it has stabilised my disease for a while. FOLFIRI with Avastin has shown some good results but again, it will slow it down but not get rid of it. 
I had Hipec at the time of my op but it is much more of a ""cleaning up"" treatment as it will only penetrate about 1mm into the cancer cell, free floating cells will be affected but not tumours per se. 
There is a possible treatment on the horizon though. 
Bromac is a combo of Bromelain and N-acetyl-cysteine which is pumped into your abdominal cavity and has shown some very promising results, however the trials were being conducted during the early stages of covid so everything has been delayed. This is a treatment worth researching.

He hurt his foot in October 2020 and everything went downhill from there. His foot healed but the pain didn't go away, it spread to his other foot and up his legs. 

He was hospitalised for pancreatitis mid November. Blood test after blood test, how did they not notice anything was wrong? 

He was discharged after a few days. His feet got worse. He couldn't walk without holding onto the walls or something solid to assist him by the end of December. 

More doctor visits. Sent away from the hospital multiple times. It was just 'alcoholic neuropathy' and 'there is nothing that can be done.' 

January 1st it got worse even when we thought it couldn't. He was at the emergency department every. single. day. From January 1st-4th. He was told 'don't bother coming back.' Thinking he was just after 'a fix' of those pain killers that weren't even doing anything anymore. 

January 5th, worse went to even worse. Again we didn't think it would get worse. He lost feeling in his hands. He could not walk unassisted. We travelled 1.5 hours to another hospital. They assured us it was alcoholic neuropathy and 'it isn't fatal' and we had nothing to worry about. 

My dad was in so much pain. He left his pain meds at home. As if he could wait 5 fucking hours for a doctor in his state. I begged to stay and be seen. I'd book a hotel room so he can rest and then we can go back to the hospital. But we went home. He had a specialist appointment the next day. It couldn't get worse than this, it can wait another day. 

That night we stayed up decorating the kitchen for his 50th birthday. 

January 6th I wake up excited to show my dad the kitchen. It was only tiny with some balloons and a light up 5 and 0 but it was something. 

Instead my mum told me to go into the room with my dad to supervise him. She has to call an ambulance because he 'wasn't making any sense.' 

He was extremely delirious talking as if he was at work. 'Put the TV on stilts' 
'is _ bringing the nails?' He hadn't worked in months because of his feet. Wtf was he talking about? (He was a concreter/steel fixer). 

Ambulance took him... the nurses in the E.D tried saying he was normal. He was pointing at 'towels' that weren't even there. He was scrunching 'paper' and throwing it in the air (there was no paper), he was chewing on 'pills' (there were no pills).
how the fuck is that normal. 

He was finally admitted. 'He has an infection somewhere in his body but we don't know where.'
'He is very low on sodium which has caused delirium.' 

Sooo many tests. 

There was a blockage in his leg but 'it isn't a problem'. 

A week later both of his legs were amputated. Above the knees. 

2 weeks later they finally find cryoglobulins in his blood.
But what was causing the Cryoglobulinemia? 
I asked them repeatedly to check for Waldenstrom's. It took 3 weeks for them to test and diagnose it. 3 fucking weeks. 

After a lot of set backs he finally came home last month after months in hospital. I'm so grateful he is here even if he is missing two limbs.
But I am still furious at the doctors who didn't do their job. 

Don't get me wrong. I know they aren't miracle workers. But how can you send someone so helpless and desperate for answers away? 

I've read his discharge summaries from January 1st-4th. 

They knew he had no pulse in his foot days before he was admitted. 

They have written down that he had diabetic neuropathy AND HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE DIABETES. 

I just had to vent.
I feel so angry at the doctors for not looking properly.
I'm sad at the pain my dad went through. 
I'm carrying so much guilty that I didn't advocate for him sooner. 

I know at the end of the day both cryoglobulinemia and waldenstrom's are hard to diagnose. But if they hadn't turned him away the first 4 days of January. If they hadn't just assumed it was neuropathy from his alcoholic history, and if they looked for Waldenstrom's when I asked, let alone weeks later, maybe it would have turned out a bit different and we wouldn't have gone through all that trauma.

Ambulance took him... the nurses in the E.D tried saying he was normal. He was pointing at 'towels' that weren't even there. He was scrunching 'paper' and throwing it in the air (there was no paper), he was chewing on 'pills' (there were no pills).
how the fuck is that normal. 

He was finally admitted. 'He has an infection somewhere in his body but we don't know where.'
'He is very low on sodium which has caused delirium.' 

Sooo many tests. 

There was a blockage in his leg but 'it isn't a problem'. 

A week later both of his legs were amputated. Above the knees. 

2 weeks later they finally find cryoglobulins in his blood.
But what was causing the Cryoglobulinemia? 
I asked them repeatedly to check for Waldenstrom's. It took 3 weeks for them to test and diagnose it. 3 fucking weeks. 

After a lot of set backs he finally came home last month after months in hospital. I'm so grateful he is here even if he is missing two limbs.
But I am still furious at the doctors who didn't do their job. 

Don't get me wrong. I know they aren't miracle workers. But how can you send someone so helpless and desperate for answers away? 

I've read his discharge summaries from January 1st-4th. 

They knew he had no pulse in his foot days before he was admitted. 

They have written down that he had diabetic neuropathy AND HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE DIABETES. 

I just had to vent.
I feel so angry at the doctors for not looking properly.
I'm sad at the pain my dad went through. 
I'm carrying so much guilty that I didn't advocate for him sooner. 

I know at the end of the day both cryoglobulinemia and waldenstrom's are hard to diagnose. But if they hadn't turned him away the first 4 days of January. If they hadn't just assumed it was neuropathy from his alcoholic history, and if they looked for Waldenstrom's when I asked, let alone weeks later, maybe it would have turned out a bit different and we wouldn't have gone through all that trauma. 

My dad has no legs and no feeling/very limited movement in his hands and I can't help but imagine if he was taken seriously it wouldn't have gotten to this point.

Just checking if we have missed anything.,"Dad 75 is diagnosed with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma - Epithelioid Type in March.

&amp;#x200B;

After numerous blood tests, biopsy, X-rays, a couple of CT-scans, and a Bronchoscopy, doctors have advised that it looks Stage III-IV, even if it hasn't spread to any other organs (at least by last CT-scan in March it was around Pleural space only, another CT-scan is scheduled this Monday).

&amp;#x200B;

Doctors have advised that there's no cure for this cancer - even if it's Stage I; however, if a patient is young enough, and the cancer is still at Stage I/II, they can perform the surgery/Radiation/Chemo/Targeted/Immunotherapy, and increase the life expectancy, but in Stage III/IV he doesn't have any chance for surgery + due to his age and other risk factors (i.e. he's a diabetic + minor heart condition + he's suffering from hypertension) they cannot give him 100% Chemotherapy as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So, he's already completed 3 (70%) cycles of Paclitaxel (200 mg) + Carboplatin (300 mg) Chemotherapy, and the next plan is to give him 3 more (70%) cycles of Paclitaxel (200 mg) + Carboplatin (300 mg) + Bevacizumab (a targeted therapy?). As far as we understand, all of these are only Palliative treatments and not Curative treatments (correct me if I'm wrong).

&amp;#x200B;

We have consulted 3 Oncologists and they all have confirmed that the treatment he's receiving is fine. However, I just wanted to check if there's any other treatment available in the market, which might be Curative that we can go for? Dad is fully aware about this disease and the treatment he's receiving, he's still super strong and hopeful that miracle will happen to him if he'll go for all the treatments he could receive."

Seratio,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_o30m8e,3,h2asmnm,"23m nonsmoker SCLC chiming in.

SCLC is highly agressive which in turn means chemo starts off very effective. Since he manages the side effects well and there's no paraneoplastic disease you guys should have quite some time at decent quality of life to get things sorted out. 

Of course you're right regarding survival rates. Regrettably medicine has not advanced that much in SCLC care during the past 20 years. However, palliative care did, and your father will enjoy higher quality of life even as his health eventually declines.

Some things that may help him:

* The most important thing is keeping his spirits up. I'm not talking about the ""Stay positive, it's going to be alright, you're a fighter / warrior / whatever"" stuff but making him feel his life worth living. Once people stop leaving their bed or at least using their head things go downhill. Of course you're supposed not to overdo it when suffering from fatigue, but consider taking walks with him (depending on his health).

* Talk to him a lot. Relive memories and get him a bunch of framed pictures. He loves his family, seeing them happy will make him happy. Let him vent, cry, laugh, express himself. He wanted to be a great dad and the way you talk about him he succeeded, tell him!

* Consider getting psychooncologic staff involved. They help patients and their loved ones cope and have plenty experience doing so. Most hospitals with a cancer ward have them.

* Food tends to be bad in hospitals and chemo makes things worse. Multiple small but high-energy meals can help prevent weight loss. Consider bringing a small gift for the nurses. If they're feeling happy that'll be nice for your dad, too.

* Encourage him to ask the docs to change up medication that doesn't work. There's dozens of anti-nausea and pain management options available.

* Allow him as much freedom as possible. Cancer makes you feel helpless. Try not to force your values or wants on him so that he may express himself freely.

Of course everyone's different. Your father is probably from another country and more than three times as old as I. So make sure to ask him what will help and think about his personality and past to work something out. You know him better than anyone on this sub.

Finally, do proper self-care. Dealing with cancer is hard for everyone involved. I certainly noticed when people got uncomfortable or felt unable to cope.",t3_o30m8e,t1_h2asmnm,2021-06-19 06:33:07,/r/cancer/comments/o30m8e/any_hope_for_dad_with_stage_iv_sclc_best_ways_to/h2asmnm/,,Any hope for dad with Stage IV SCLC?

It sounds like your father's been through a lot. I see they're putting him on Keytruda/Inlyta. That's a great combo, it's what I'm doing. I went from mets on lungs, both kidneys, and lymph nodes, to just the primary tumor on my right kidney and a few small spots on my lungs. My original tumor on my kidney was bout the side of a Sonic Route 44, pushing up on my liver. Now it's about 9cm, still big but huge improvement. We've done nothing other than Keytruda and Inlyta. Surgery wasn't an option for me due to amount of mets as well.

We're about to start radiation, possibly, to kind of help speed things along. 

As far as getting a prognosis... I think that's kinda like pulling teeth with most oncologist. I'm sure there's evidence for it too, but I think they're afraid that setting life expectancy, actually sets life expectancy. It changes people's willingness to fight, live, etc. and also, can change their mental health. I talked to my oncologist at the beginning and pretty much the only thing we talked about that point was if we get within that 6-month window, I just want to be as comfy as possible.

I'm sure if you push your oncologist hard enough, they might be willing to tell you more definitively, but if your parents don't want to know, that sounds like your biggest hurdle.

I've started preparing, making sure I have everything written down, where my accounts are, passwords, etc. Even reached out to a funeral home, but COVID got in the way, and I haven't followed up on that. I'm as optimistic as I can be, but I'm also planning. The fear is real though, my car was totaled on the first day of treatment and after two years I'm still afraid to replace it as I don't want someone to have to deal with that. I'm hesitant to do any long-term planning.

I'm sure from a medical standpoint they'd love all their patients to do nothing but focus on getting better, but this is the real world. Even those of us luck enough to be on disability don't always have enough to really live on, at least not the way the system is set up in the United States.

I'm a little different from you, I'm wanting to take some time off and fight this thing, so I can get back to a normal life and go at it full steam. I'm almost 50 though, so it doesn't leave a lot of room if this take too long for me to beat it. 

Hold on to those hopes and plans, and keep working toward them. Find the middle ground maybe. Online classes that are flexable? Get your appoints sechedule before/after classes? I'm sure you've thought of all that stuff, but find a way to make it all work.

The doctors are going to schedule you what you need, that part is frustrating. I do the same cycle every 6 weeks.

To be clear, I’m not suicidal but with that said my life hasn’t been so amazing that I’m particularly motivated to go through months of chemo and a major surgery to prolong it. 

Has anyone made the “no treatment” choice? How is it going? What was the reaction of doctors, friends and family? Any regrets?"
Fuckthiscancershit,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_o8uoeh,1,h3d1r1z,"  I understand this all too well. I have stage 4 breast cancer aka Metastatic breast cancer, treatable but incurable and terminal. I am doing treatment and palliative care (because it's not just for end of life. My palliative care nurse does my pain meds so I can function.) and will continue until my quality of life starts declining. Then I will stop treatment and carry on with palliative care. 
  When I got my diagnosis I talked to my parents and sister and made sure they understood what it meant. I made a living will and did a power of attorney that is on file at all my doctors and the hospitals. That way my wishes are there in black and white. It was and continues to be hard, but they understand. 
  I told my best friends in person, but for everyone else (friends and other family members) I made a fb post. In it I explained my diagnosis in detail, probably more detail than some were comfortable with, and laid out my rules for what I was going to allow them to say to me or do. I mean this is happening to me, not them.
  I let them know that I would not listen to ""cures"" for cancer; like apple cider vinegar, special water, or restrictive diets because those things don't work and to remember that what I have is incurable. I was not going to come to their church (I'm not religious) and I was not going to pray that god would heal me (that's not how this works). But if they wanted to add me to the prayer list at their church or pray for me themselves that was perfectly fine; if that made them feel better and they wanted/needed to use that as a coping mechanism. I also explained the Ring theory and provided a link for them to read it for themselves. 
  For those that don't know, the Ring theory basically says that the patient is in the center circle. The patient is able to ask for help, support, someone to talk to, and anything else they need from anyone in the surrounding circles. The next circle is caregivers, close friends, and family. They can help support the patient, but if they need support, someone to talk to, or help in dealing with the diagnosis they must look for that in the outer circle or circles; they cannot ask the patient for these things. The outer circle or circles consist of friends and family that aren't particularly close to the patient, but may be close with someone in the second circle and community members, organizations, religious institutions/leaders, etc. These people are there to support the patient and the people in the second circle. Because the person at the center of this mess, the patient, the one who is sick and possibly dying should never be asked to comfort someone else because that person has problems dealing with the patient's diagnosis. If that person is close to you, then you may offer comfort if you wish to and are able to. That way, the patient only has to focus on themselves and how they wish to handle this.
  You can print the theory out, email it, fb it; basically however you want to distribute it. This is a perfect way to let people know what is appropriate and it also helps because you didn't just make it up; it's a psychological theory that therapists and other mental health professionals use.
  Dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis is hard enough. We shouldn't have to worry about how everyone else is handling it and their crazy suggestions and unrealistic ""treatments"", even if they are well meaning. I hope this helps some.

It was Friday, so I’ll be getting calls next week to schedule more CT scans and PET scans. Aside from the port at this stage in the process, what scares me the most is the bone marrow biopsy. 

The one in my chest HURT and that was just tissue, mostly through my breast to get at the lump near my heart. They have to go through a lot more tissue and a bone to get at the bone marrow. I’m scared of how bad this one is going to hurt. Everything I read seems to come back 50/50 between it didn’t really hurt at all and it was the worst pain they’d ever felt in their life.

Has she asked for a dietician review? Whilst she’s palliative if she can still eat and needs the calories for nutrients they can help her out with additional supplements if she’ll tolerate them…

Also mention to her team about not sleeping and they should be able to make her more comfortable for that - is that related to her depression, pain, nausea ? Etc 

I imagine she’s under her oncology palliative care team possibly? So sounds like questions for them…

I’d recommend getting a list of these things written down (big focus on what it would take to bring her home - are you prepared for how much work that would be also? It’s ok if you’re not… but it’s just going to be a lot of care… whilst the healthcare system does provide support it’s not a huge amount.), get your mums permission and talk to the respite hospital about who do you field these questions to… and if you do have contact points for her oncology even better.

She was successfully treated using a clinical trial drug, but we are unable to obtain it in order save her life.","4  years ago on the day of our rehearsal dinner, my wife started her first  round of chemotherapy. She had been diagnosed a couple of months before  with stage IVb endometrial cancer. The following 6 months she endured  monthly chemotherapy, hairloss, and a major and life changing surgery.  It was our introduction into the world of living with and trying to  survive cancer.

Since then she has  experienced several recurrences, received several successful  treatments, and traveled to several of the top hospitals around the  country in search of something cutting edge, like the stuff you see on  the front page of reddit from time to time about breakthrough therapies.  All the time, my wife and I were beginning our lives together. We  learned how to be a good husband and wife, she went to school full time  to become a nurse, we bought our first home, and we got Millie, our  puppy.

All the time distracted by  the journey of our lives that we were starting was the constant reminder  of her persistently returning cancer. We needed to find our  breakthrough therapy - one that could allow her to live her life  finally free of this horrible disease.

We  participated in several clinical trials after countless hours of  research and consults from physicians and patient advocates all over the  country.

We found it. She was  enrolled in a  phase 1 clinical trial of a Wee1 inhibitor drug. This  type of drug targets a rare mutation of hers. This is what we've been  looking for! We moved across the country and took the chance.

We  held our breath when they finally reported results after a month of  therapy. The drug worked, and it worked very well. it reduced her cancer  by 90 percent in just one month. She continued on the trial for several  months.

We finally started to see  the future of our lives together unfold in our minds. We were able to  conceive a life with this horrible disease behind us and not talk about  the future with an undercurrent of apprehension. After all, we wanted to  start a family.

Suddenly she  was removed from the trial. Phase 1 trials are designed to determine  safe dosing, and Becca's was too high. Her platelet count was too low.  Can she take a break? Can we reduce the doseage? No and no. Furthermore,  she is ineligible for admission into ANY wee1 inhibitor clinical trials  in the future. What a shame as the therapy is now in phase 2b  throughout the country with huge success and given in more moderate  dosages.

Fast forward to today. She is downstairs, trying to sleep again. She can't make it through  the night because we have to use a 60 mL syringe to empty the bile from  her stomach several times from a NG tube that comes out of her nose.  Shes listening to a loud podcast. It helps to have white noise over the  sound of the pump that powers her TPN, or liquid nutrition, and soon I  will have to wake her up to drain ascites fluid from her abdominal  drain.

Her cancer has taken up  most of the space in her abdomen and is blocking her intestines. She  cannot eat, drink, or even swallow her own spit. She weighs 85 pounds.

The  palliative care team keeps reminding her that she doesn't need to  continue down this road if she doesn't want to, but she wants to fight.  After all, she is only 35 years old.

Despite  the incredible amount of physical and emotional pain she is in, she  will not give up. How could you when you KNOW there is a drug that will  save her life.

Her Oncologist is on board. She will create a treatment plan and safely administer it.

The  drug companies will not let her have it under compassionate  use/expanded access despite ""right to try"" legislation that was signed  in 2018.

We don't know what else  to do. We have called, sent letters, e-mailed, and pleaded with the drug  companies to release the drug to us with no liability. Please, if  anyone has any ideas for how to approach this, we have been through the  Goldwater Institute, Mytomorrows, Widetrial. Does anyone have experience  with this?

Edit: We have created a petition to help get support in obtaining her cure. Please read sign and share if you have the time.

It was so hard!!!  She passed in April…..   although it’s so hard to even think about hospice. (I cried just hearing that). Hospice will be there to make sure your dad is comfortable BUT you need to make sure you advocate for your dad…. Ask questions.   Ask them if they will be available when you need them….. we were so scared and picked the first hospice… they never returned calls.  Medicine was never ready… we switched to another after a few days and I can say it was soooo hard!!  We were already in shock with the diagnosis than the hospice not helping made it worse.     If we would of known than what we know now !!   We didn’t think we were ready for hospice and second guessed it…. But the right hospice will be a great resource ….. hospice doesn’t need to start at the end…. Many people get on and than off again….. but they will help you navigate this really hard time!!!

1) Do you know where you want to be for end of life? Home? Would you be ok in a hospice facility? Some of this may be out of your hands depending on your deterioration. Also check to see what your insurance covers for palliative care—you may be able to get a hospital bed in your home etc.

2) Decide what you want done with your remains. Plan what funeral home you want to take your body (especially if you pass at home). If you want to be buried, decide the cemetery/plot/roughly what headstone you want/casket/etc. Think about the cost—life insurance sometimes REIMBURSES funeral costs, which means it’s out of pocket at first. Sometimes they pay the funeral home directly, but only certain things are covered.

3) Have a Will situated—make intentions clear, even for things like jewelry or electronics. 

4) Have a power of attorney. Do you want a DNR? 

5) Fill out HIPPA forms to allow family to know your medical information if you feel you need someone to help with this who would normally not be privvy to info.

I have my first appointment with an actual cancer doctor this week and will be starting chemo soon (which is terrifying in it's own right), but I've just been doing these other surgeries and hospital stays on my own so far. It's getting taxing.

I don't have many people in my life, my support system is my two siblings who are 20 and 25, neither drive and I don't live with them. Other than that I have a roommate and a couple friends from work who keep up with me via text every now and then. I'm pretty isolated, I don't have a lot. Not to mention, I'm used to being the one in the supportive role, and now that I need help more and more I don't know how to access it.

Are there programs that help people like me who have no one to be my caretaker in home and travel situations? I'm in Canada, so country specific advise would be nice, if possible. Experiences from others in similar situations outside of the country would be nice too. 

I already have a home care nurse that I meet this week but that's just a nurse, what about all the other things I need help with? I'm just so worried I'm going to have to put pressure on my siblings to do things they don't need to (like if I have to move in with them and we all have to break our leases, or making one or both get their license even tho they both have driving anxiety). I'm just...getting worried.

He’s 69, so not that much older than your mom, but i’m 34 at least, and a bit more settled in my life. I feel awful for you to experience this so young. Please know you can DM me anytime if you just need to vent about this. 

I do want to give you some optimism, though. Kepra absolutely does make them into ‘zombies’ mentally. My dad said he felt completely out of it while on it, and it made me much more depressed about his prognosis. Also the radiation in combination with the Temodar is rough on the body and brain. Once his doctor gave us the okay to go off, however, he’s since become much more like himself and his quality of life has improved. Oral Temodar alone is less intense than radiation + temo, so once you’re off the seizure meds and into just oral chemo, you’re honestly going to probably see more of your ‘real mom’ after she adjusts to the meds. Right now, it’s the hardest hitting point in the treatment, so it’s much tougher on the brain, and it can feel hopeless, but once that’s been done as much as it can be done, there is really not much else the doctors can do, and they know that. Palliative care becomes the priority, and honestly? It’s better that way. Once your mom can be off the intense meds, you may get the chance to spend some good time. I’ve been lucky enough to have two years with my dad since the initial terror and dread of the diagnosis. Some people only get a few months, but some get a few years. It’s not all cut and dried yet. 

Give yourself the time to grieve now, while your mom is in the fog, and then when she’s off Kepra, hopefully you can focus on giving all the best of your energy and time with her until the end. I know it’s hard and it feels impossible. But every day gets a little easier. You’ll be okay.

They found a mass 3.2cm x 3.3cm x 4.4cm in his left frontal lobe. We were able to get one of the best brain surgeons in the world to operate on him on October 26th. They determined he had an ogliodendroglioma, in between stage 2 and 3. He started radiation and chemo in February and now he’s on chemo. He opted for the pill, because regardless he’s going to die. He’s currently on 315mg of temozolomide for the first five days of every month and 1,500mg of levetiracetam. He’s been given 6-10 years, and we’re both handling it as well as expected. 

Honestly, you’d never tell he has cancer or anything wrong with him. He still works out (he’s a pretty big dude in the sense he’s 5’8” and 200lbs of pure muscle), works, drives, does everything just fine. He has some word retrieval and memory issues, but nothing that other people would notice other than me. 

It’s just me and my Dad, and it always has been just us. His family has been gone for a while, my mum is out of the picture and I’m an only child. I just turned 21, I’m learning how to drive and I still live at home. Our biggest concern is what’s going to happen when it’s his time. His oncologist told us he’ll likely just die in his sleep, and there won’t be any warning. He’ll simply go to sleep and not wake up. We’ve also been told that whilst we won’t know for sure what his problems will be when the tumour grows back, it might be something as little as worsening memory problems and speech issues. Because he had zero obvious symptoms before the seizures, that’s why they guess it could be as small as that (though we’re not dumb to the chance it’ll be worse, we’re hoping for the best but preparing for the worst).

Does anyone have any experience with this? The internet is only so helpful with learning about what it’ll be like when the tumour grows back and when it’s his time. I’d just like an idea of what I’m going to be dealing with when the time comes. Thanks in advance to anyone who might be able to give us some insight about what lies ahead for us as a patient and caregiver."

He has tumors in his throat and 2 tiny ones in his brain. The leg tumor will be resolved through radiation and his brain tumors will be dealt with through laser surgery. But his kidney cancer was prescribed Opdivo, an immunotherapy drug. I’m worried because I heard that immunotherapy is often used for cancers that have progressed into late stage and surgery wouldn’t be the best option. I previously thought the tumors all coincided but were not caused by spreading cancer because he used to have a tumor elsewhere in his body that got removed before kidney cancer came into play. The doctor has not said what stage his kidney cancer is in so I do not know what to make of the situation. He will only undergo three sessions of IV administered immunotherapy. I know this is not the best place to ask this, but I am not sure where else to ask before seeing the doctor again."

I have a question and wondering if anyone has any experience with this situation. My dad has infiltrative HCC, it's at minimum, stage 3, suspected stage 4 based on some lesions they just found on his skull. The only option he had for treatment was immunotherapy. It has maybe a 20% success rate of slowing cancer growth in those with similar diagnoses. 

He's had two treatments and has stopped the majority of his other medications (CHF from multiple MI's, high cholesterol, high BP, diabetes 2, etc) and this has eased a lot of his most unbearable symptoms. I'm really trying to be proactive here though, and he qualifies for hospice, so I'm trying to get that set up. 

The biggest issue is the immunotherapy. From what I can gather, immunotherapy isn't a covered service under hospice. To be clear, this isn't something that will cure him in the slightest. It's meant to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with the cancer. Be that as it may, I'm not the one who writes insurance policies. 

Here's where I'm wondering if we have a work around. He has medicare, but also has private insurance through my mom's work. Has anyone ever tried to get hospice covered by Medicare while also getting a private insurance to cover immunotherapy? Or even some other medication/treatment not covered under hospice care? 

The doctors say that even with the immunotherapy, his life expectancy isn't more than 6 months. He has palliative care now, and while that does help, I worry about him not having the equipment he may need to get through worsening symptoms at home, and ending up in the hospital during the end of his life. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for being so ramble-y about this. I can clarify want information if needed. Thanks for the help! And also fuck cancer."

I suspect r/cancer is where redditors with a new diagnosis start out looking for guidance and information, and that this space should be cultivated with that fact in mind.

Maybe subreddits like “NewToCancer” or “RelativeWithCancer” or “CancerHelp” or “CancerScared” would be better creations to channel non-engaged relatives and weepy non-patients into. They are in pain and confusion, but of a highly derivative quality, and should not crowd out the newly diagnosed who need comradery and guidance the most.

I am a veteran at this point with a lot of hard earned knowledge and deep understanding of both the medical and radiation oncology systems and the ins and outs of treatment, insurance, drug interactions, palliative care, and patient/caregiver mental well-being, but I have to admit that I have not really engaged with this community because there are so many “Grandpa has a colon tumor, what do I do?!?”-type posts cluttering up the ecosystem. 

I would really like to see a sorting mechanism that would serve the needs of the secondary and tertiary “victims” of cancer sincerely and adequately while preserving this space for those patients who are taking the first step of the journey themselves and need guidance and information about medical and personal choices that are coming too fast to process.  The truth is r/cancer is the first subreddit anyone in that position would think to look at, so the space should be moderated accordingly.

Yes, cancer affects everyone around the patient. I get. I'm living it firsthand myself as a patient. I'd just like a place to commiserate with people in the same boat without non-patients being the majority, asking us of all people what they should do and how they should feel. Again, I know they mean well, but damn.

Edit: damn did this take off. I never intended to say that real caregivers aren't welcome or people shouldn't be able to come here to learn, and I certainly never intended to kill off the sub in favour of a new one(but I'm subbed to the new one also). Just need some focus on the patients and the disease instead of ""what should I buy my friend"" and ""someone I know has cancer, *my* feelings need validating"" kind of things.

My husband has stage IV lung cancer with mets to his adrenals, bone, and pancreas.  He has significant pain in his ribs, which makes sense because he has a pancoast tumor and likewise  his latest PET scan indicated the bone mets are specifically in his ribs and shoulder blades, but the thing that is really becoming a problem in addition to the constant pain in his ribs is his hands cramping.

Both hands cramp so severely that he most often can't even use them; they are not only painful, but they contort.  Our internet searches (because that's what we're left to) indicate low potassium, so we are loading him up on that and sometimes it helps.  But I'm wondering, for the purposes of this post, if this is a thing that happens among lung cancer patients and if so, what others do to mitigate.  Because as terrible as this whole thing is, the fact that he can't even raise a coffee cup to his lips without contortions resulting in him spilling it all over himself is the thing that most concerns him day in and day out.

Any thoughts/feedback welcome.

As mentioned, I now feel awkward about posting here as a caregiver, but he can't type here to ask for himself, so it is on me to try to get some feedback on his behalf.  I hope someone reading this is familiar enough to offer some information, and thank you in advance."

I’ve not had a great life tbh. I sit on the sidelines and watch people sail effortlessly through life.

It sounds, to be honest, like you are approaching that juncture. Where there are more bad days than good and the chemotherapy seems to be doing more harm than good.

Don't feel pressured to make any decisions alone. Try to get your dad and the rest of your family on a good day to talk about it. What does he want? Who else is responsible for helping to share the caregiving?

There is a bit of a middle-ground too between hospice and cure that is sometimes ignored which is palliative care which may be worth discussing with your doctor.

str4ngerf4ce,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_pt6jal,1,hdu6fd3,"Right so, first of all Hello everyone ! first time posting.So here goes, I pretty much understand this assessment and plan,my dad had a large tumor on his stomach that was removed, they found more cancer . It’s an aggressive cancer, likely spread to the peritoneum but not organs. The thing is, he’s on his 5th out of 8th round and we’re in a limbo bc he has not yet had any new scans since May. The doctor that came up with this assessment plan moved to Taiwan, yesterday my dad met his radiologist (I believe) for the first time , i was on the phone on speaker listening in.She said hi I’m so and so and i don’t have all your information yet so please fill me in, she then proceeds to say right as of now if the tumor that he has by his liver has shrunk and depending on how much that they would do surgery or they might hit it with radiation. Now my concern is one of his previous doctors said that it was behind the liver and he didn’t think that it was a good idea because it would damage the liver and it’s too big anyway.He wanted to do an exploratory laparotomy/debulk and HIPEC. She said if he’s a candidate that it’s the way to go but that there is no way of knowing that since we have to wait for new scans. I then asked her why the plan was now changing if peritoneal carcimatosis has a very poor prognosis in general and if treated with chemotherapy or even radiation . She then proceeded to answer me a whole bunch of nothing. Im left with more questions than anything, I understand she can’t answer that because there are no new scans so truly they don’t know what’s going on yet. My dad seems great, has lost muscle mass but recently got his appetite back. Feels fatigued at times, but over all he’s doing great given circumstances. I’m now wondering if his cancer is staged 3b because they aren’t sure that he has peritoneal cancer as well, or because it’s not in his organs? Also if no HIPEC was done then how would the peritoneal cancer be treated?  Just wait till what?… is their intention now palliative? Opposed to the doctor that left and wanted a more aggressive approach.If they don’t think he’s a candidate for HIPEC for xyz reason should  we get a second opinion? So many questions ! Is it too early to get ahead of myself,I felt like my eye was going to pop out of my head from the frustration I felt during that “appointment” which was just a meet and greet.Maybe I just need to relax.I’d just like to know why they’re already leaning toward no HIPEC if they don’t have any new scans, and it’s pretty common knowledge that peritoneal cancer doesn’t respond well to other types of treatment.I should mention there was a disagreement amongst his team, one doctor did not want to do HIPEC from the start bc in his words “doesn’t want them to potentially kill him” bc he’s strong and will do fine with just chemo.The other thought it was the best route of things went according to plan, this doctor has now left.",t3_pt6jal,t1_hdu6fd3,2021-09-22 12:47:12,/r/cancer/comments/pt6jal/deleted_by_user/hdu6fd3/,r/cancer,[deleted by user],[removed]
hydraflora,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ps62lv,0,he6y72m,"My father is 81 and was diagnosed with stage 3 multiple myeloma. He also has dementia but he’s always made it clear that his biggest fear in terms of death was terminal cancer and he’d prefer to die quickly mostly because of fear. And he made this clear before he developed dementia so I was confident in making his wish to get hospice care instead of palliative care while my sister didn’t feel as comfortable and has asked him 3 times since his diagnosis. And he vaguely understands but says things like when it’s my time to go it’s my time. And his oncologist told us that within all the gibberish he talks that he actually said he’d be happy if he was able to get 6 more months out of life. 

Also, he’s pretty sick, has lesions on his bones and only weighs 100 lbs now so the doctor said he’d that they’d administer a weaker form of palliative treatment and even that would probably kill him faster than just doing nothing and getting hospice care. 

We put him in a facility for 2 weeks but they weren’t paying him enough attention AND they were disorganized and I would get about 15 calls daily and then they’d still not follow through with our discussions. And with covid most of the time we couldn’t visit him. Having him home is much more work but also more peace of mind and I know I take better care of him. He’s been at my house for 2 weeks and it’s been so hard but I think I’ve found a caregiver that will start next week. Hospice checks in, provides meds and someone bathes him twice per week.

taguilty,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_px4sin,2,hel81i9,"I'm not sure where you're from but I'm in Australia and palliative care services will probably differ. We brought my Dad home and he had his last days there surrounded by family. Practically, things might be different. Our public palliative care services allowed the visit of a nurse for things like medication and sometimes care but for the most part we did it ourselves. A hospital bed would have been supplied but we missed the once weekly cut off so I went out and hired one, as well as all the things that might be useful for nursing at home. The hospital implanted a pain pump in his spine (cancer had metastasised to his bones) but it wasn't enough and we had to call the nurses regularly to give him top up pain relief. Unfortunately, the public health system put a strain on availability so we were often waiting for the nurse to arrive and he was suffering.
All the other aspects of nursing care we did ourselves, once we had been shown how in the hospital before he was discharged.
Helping him pass at home was both a very hard and a very fulfilling thing to do. All the family took turns being with him and the couple of us that could cope with the nursing care did that as well. He died fifteen minutes after his last grandchild had said goodbye to him and  I can just remember this peaceful slow ebbing out of life. It just felt natural.

Maybe hear what the new oncologist recommends, then make sure you have a physician-signed Do Not Resuscitate form in your medical file AND a copy at home. Talk to people who've had the same treatment for their opinions. Tell the oncologist that you're fed up with procedures that don't work (or partially work).

Make sure your medical team is on the same page when it comes to treatments. Talk to palliative care providers so you have that in place. Give yourself a few weeks to consider alternatives and make your decisions with a cool head.

Best of luck to you, dear.

Know why the mortician nails the coffin lid down before burial? So the oncologist can't recommend one more round of chemo.

Celticlady47,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_qqadeg,4,hjzj1nl,"I'm so sorry that this has happened to you. Last year I went in by a fluke &amp; had a test which showed a 3cm tumour &amp; 2 more spots in my breast. Like you, I felt fine, no symptoms, I couldn't even feel the lump, it was so bewildering a place to be.  The most difficult thing is advocating when you feel like crap, or are tired or the treatments they are giving you are too much. Is there someone that you feel would be a good support buddy for you, who could help keep you focused on getting the treatments you want to have &amp; not let doctors push you away from treatments &amp; into palliative care, (since that's what you want)? 

You want to try everything &amp; so you should! You don't know what will be the outcome until you try the treatment &amp; the doctors often follow an algorithm when determining treatments, so you will need to be pushy to get the treatment you need. Right now our health system is in triage, so don't be afraid to ask for a full evaluation &amp; assessment if they say that you might not qualify for something. 

Originally, I was told that I didn't qualify for genetic testing, (solely based on my age alone which at 53, I'm not too old, but for the quick screening I was - i.e. there's 3 steps, Quick Screening, Hour long phone call screening &amp; then if you qualify, the actual test). This testing is expensive &amp; few people qualify for it, but I asked to have the full assessment instead of just the preliminary assessment &amp; after the hour long interview, I was a candidiate for testing, (and that was also based on an algorithm, but a much better one that didn't just cut of women who were over 47 yrs old). I have a good reason for needing this testing due to further surgery I will be having next year, so I needed to know if I need another mastectomy, or other parts removed before I have my final surgery, otherwise the final surgery will be a waste. Plus, since I have so many women in my family history with cancer, I have this inner voice yelling at me telling me to find out if anything else is wrong or potentially wrong.

Anyhow, my lengthy point is that you don't know what you can qualify for until you ask for it.   It sounds like they are saying that there are treatment options, but they are trying to get you over to only palliative care. I know that on your NHS resources are limited &amp; backed up due to covid, (Canada has a similar position)  but that doesn't mean that chemo won't help, if they are giving you that option. So if given the option to try a treatment &amp; you are willing, then by all means do it!  Please come here &amp; vent away about all of the absurdities that treatments will give you, we'll listen &amp; support you.",t3_qqadeg,t1_hjzj1nl,2021-11-09 21:26:36,/r/cancer/comments/qqadeg/joining_this_sub/hjzj1nl/,r/cancer,Joining this sub,"So here's my story so far.....

54M in the UK.

Just over two months ago I was planning to go see my elderly parents for my birthday and decided it was probably worth doing a home lateral flow Covid test to try and keep them safe. I wanted to make sure I did it properly so shone a torch (US: flashlight) down my throat in a mirror while scraping my tonsils with the swab. Covid test was negative but what I saw at the back of my throat scared the crap out of me. Honestly if a cartoonist was to draw cancer it looked like that.

Since then I've been to my own GP surgery, ENT consult, MRI, CT Scan, day surgery for a biopsy and finally a PET/CT. Fair play to the NHS. I know they're really struggling with workload at the moment but they've done all this in a couple of months on their fast track cancer program and for that I'm really grateful.

Today I was back in the ENT for the results and it doesn't look too good. I've got a 6cm HPV caused tumor on my right tonsil. Its in my lymph nodes on both sides. Too far advanced to be operable. CT scan found 'something' in my lung. Not sure what yet as the PET/CT was only done on Saturday and the results are not in yet but given the tumor in my throat I'm not too optimistic.

If it is cancer in my lung they told me it would be palliative care only. For my throat they're planning 6 weeks or daily radio therapy with weekly chemo at the same time. I've got to have a feed tube put in my stomach as they expect I won't be able to eat by about half way through. Speech and nutritional therapy planned too. It gives me a 40% to 50% chance of surviving providing the lung isn't cancer.

Not even sure why I'm making this post. Maybe just to write this all out for my own benefit. I joined this sub a couple of months ago but didn't want to post until it was medically confirmed. The whole thing is bewildering. I don't know how I ended up this far advanced without ever noticing any symptoms. I was fit, cycling hundreds of miles a week, eating healthy and wam, here's cancer. The treatment sounds brutal but I think I've got to try. Apparently I'm supposed to advocate for myself but I have no idea how to do that. I don't even know what questions to ask, either on here or to the doctors.

Oh well. Thanks for reading. Good luck and health to all of you on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks all of you for your replies and encouragement. Hope you get to see this update. I've just had a bit of good news from the hospital. They don't think the 'something' on my lung is metastic cancer. Must not have lit up on the PET/CT. Now the coming fight seems so much more achievable. "

Did your Oncologist explain what metastatic/stage IV means? If not, that would be a good question to ask. Metastatic cancer is not curable and treatments are focused on symptom management and slowing down disease progression. The Oncologist should also explain to you in detail your treatment plan - especially with multiple organ systems involved. Are you doing chemo, radiation, surgery? What order? All those questions you should know answers to and be able to understand in a way that you can explain to others in clear language. Quality of life with metastatic cancer is a big consideration so make sure to ask those questions too. If you don’t have a solid understanding of your prognosis abs treatment plan, then personally I would make another appointment with the Oncologist (or their APRN, ect) to ask all your questions before starting treatment. A Palliative Care consult might also be super helpful for you to understand your options, prognosis and they can help with symptom management!! They can work hand in hand with your Oncology team.

Ryeruvrootru,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_r4ohai,3,hmi121f,"I can answer one of those questions: you can use either VA OR private insurance/medicare. The VA will only pay for care received at a VA facility unless you have prior approval, which is not easy to get unless you live far away from a VA hospital. 

Personally, I have had some very bad experiences with the VA, so if you have any alternative, I would suggest going with that.

Private insurance will almost always be your primary payer of his treatment, so you should get a list of hospice programs that are in his network. Those programs will determine what care he will get. Perhaps you can start there. If he's been to an oncologist, they will have palliative care specialists that can help you choose and answer a lot of your other questions.

Is it common for hospice to happen in a facility, or at home?

What do I look for in facility, should we have to do a facility?

I have yet to have a single patient tell me that they regret coming onto hospice services. The majority of the families that I interact with tell me they should’ve done this months ago. In my experience what makes it extremely difficult on the patient as well as your family as well as the hospice and or palliative team is When hospice is fixed at the very last moment… And because everyone is different in response to medication‘s differently it’s an extremely fast pace struggle that is unbelievably hard on the family as well as the patient to get the patient comfortable enough in passing compared to you taking care of the patient for a few months to get to know what works and what does not work for the patient. There’s also a lot of education involved since hospice is available 24 x 7 but not in the home or at the hospital or at the nursing facility 24 x 7. Most families are not trained in how to care for somebody who is dying. Most facilities don’t have the experience either because they’re more trained on keeping people alive without regard to how much suffering the treatments are causing.

Only you can be the judge as to whether you want to try to extend like even though you may have extremely poor quality of life or to be as comfortable as possible for whatever life remains.

The social worker should be handling things like this on the regular and should have some ideas for you. Perhaps he could go to a rehab facility and be hooked up with a transport service to take him to chemo. It might be possible you would need to hire a care giver to sit with him following chemo while he’s at the rehab if he needs a bit more attention.

Don’t let the hospital put this burden all on you. They have the resources to guide, they just need to be “encouraged” to offer them.

ketogirlfromucf,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_hn3bk8e,7,hn3jcj9,"Social worker here (also battling cancer). THIS is 100% what I came to say but you wrote it so well. You’re offering the realistic picture. The reality of the situation is that the family needs to hire 24-7 nursing care if the goal is to keep grandpa home and pursue treatment. If you can’t afford it then his (and grandmas) safety take priority and he needs to go into a nursing home to receive the 24-7 care and forgoe the cancer treatments. The reality of the situation too is that if grandpa can’t even get to the Oncologist office and be healthy enough to accept treatment then he won’t be receiving treatment anyways. Oncologists use what’s called a “ECOG Performance Scale” to determine if they can even ethically offer treatment to someone. If at 89 grandpa is already disabled, requiring total care and mostly confined to a bed/chair then he is at stage 4 already. Most Oncologists will not offer treatment to patients at this age because the risk outweighs the benefit. Stage 5 is death. 

The hardest part for me as a hospital based palliative care social worker is that often times oncologists will tell families someone “needs to get stronger … go to rehab … get strong enough to come see me in the office before I can offer treatment” when deep down they know the person is not going to be able to do that. In many ways it gives false hope and robs you/the family of the grieving process. 

Have you thought about speaking with hospice to see what kind of support they could bring your family and shifting the focus more on your grandpas quality of life?? He already has dementia, cancer, he is bedbound, in pain and I’m sure exhausted. You’re asking a lot from a man that has lived a very long full life to now start cancer treatments on a frail body. I think it would be helpful to take a step back from your fear of losing your grandpa and really think about what is most important for your grandparents right now.

pmabraham,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_r9gybg,59,hnbw17r,"(Hospice RN case manager sharing...)  

1) Medications:  All comfort medications and medications related to the terminal illness are covered by hospice.  OTC, supplements, and medications not directly related to the terminal illness are typically handled as they were prior to hospice.

2) Durable medical equipment (DME) is typically covered by hospice for basic DME needs.  I.e. electric hospital bed, oxygen concentrators (basic models), oxygen tanks, rollators, walkers, etc.  Specialty equipment such as sit-to-stand chairs and electric/powered wheelchairs are not typically covered by hospice.

3) Support/Staffing:  24-hour per day **availability** without regard to weekends and holidays.  CNA (certified nursing assistants -- often mistakenly called a nurse BUT not a nurse!)/HHA to help with bathing, changing, **light** housekeeping (generally directly around the patient's area) as well as educating family members in how to do the same tasks when they are not present, RN case managers (RN CM) who come on-site to assess the current needs, provide education on the disease process and progression, medications, working with the patient's attending physician and the hospice medical director on changes to the plan of care, managing the entire care team, social workers to help with community resources as well as provide education, chaplain (often non-denominational) to provide spiritual **and** emotional support.  

One of the most misunderstood areas of staffing and support is that none of us are onsite 24x7 with the patient, none of us work ""blocks"" of time (though Medicare's standards is to try to be with the patient and family for no less than 30 minutes).  We visit, we do a set of assigned tasks, we work through any unassigned issues that are important to deal with before we leave, then we leave to see the next patient and family and so on.  The social worker can often provide information on how to obtain 24x7 support on-site but that is not financially covered by hospice itself.

4) IMPORTANT:  We are experts in the natural death and dying process encompassing all terminal illnesses, discomfort/lack of comfort/pain issues your loved one and family will go through.  Outside of **palliative** specialists, there are absolutely no substitutes for the expertise we bring to the table.  There are times we unintentionally prolong the loved one's life because it is EXTREMELY common for medications not to be reviewed on a regular basis to determine if the medications are causing outright harm to your loved one and should be discontinued or modified.   Good hospice professionals will sugar coat nothing, and help you know what to expect over time (not exact dates and times to be clear).

I cannot stress #4 above.  Personally, I've case managed situations where the doctors did not have a clue how to manage the patient's pain where the hospice team got the pain so well managed the patient was able to go on a final vacation before passing, cases where the patient was so restless non hospice/palliative care doctors were clueless to get the situation managed so the patient could come home and so on.

Lastly, the word, ""hospice"" is a philosophy, not a location.  The word, ""hospice"" is a philosophy, not one big organization.  The word, ""hospice,"" is a philosophy, not a setup like EMS where there are strategically located buildings/locations (stressing the first sentence) from whom staff operate.   There are typically two to dozens of hospice agencies servicing various geographic areas (though be careful that two separate agencies may still be owned by a larger corporation).  It's always a good idea to interview two or more hospice agencies to find out how they would manage your situation vs. just interviewing one.  During the interview ask who owns the agency (i.e. Aseracare is owned by Amedisys (an extremely large public company focused on profit), Grane is owned by Bright Spring (a non-profit), and so on.",t3_r9gybg,t1_hnbw17r,2021-12-05 15:09:18,/r/cancer/comments/r9gybg/what_exactly_does_home_hospice_cover_my_doctor/hnbw17r/,r/cancer,What exactly does home hospice cover?

It doesn’t have a lot of treatment options because it’s relatively rare (meaning funding is scarce since it’s a matter of prioritizing research dollars for the cancers representing the greatest risk or impact). The main solution is total excision of all affected areas (they used to use a morcellation technique until they realized that chopping a cancerous body that travels quickly through the bloodstream into teeny tiny little bits was a bad move). Last year in July 2020 they did a radical hysterectomy, removing the uterus, cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissues around those areas and then followed up with brachytherapy (targeted radiation). Problem is that before it was diagnosed, in June 2020 they assumed it was fibroids, some of which they removed without biopsying using (drum roll) morcellation. 🥺

I got super tired in April (turned out to be anemia), and they ordered a PET-CT scan as part of the tests. The liver and lungs lit up so they did a biopsy of one of the liver nodules &amp; confirmed it was ULMS metastasized to the lungs &amp; liver. They sent the sample to Foundation One, after which they put me on Ibrance (usually used for breast cancer but has shown some efficacy in slowing the progression of lipo-/leiomyosarcomas and is less harmful than traditional chemo and radiation).

 Tell them about how your quality of life is suffering. Get palliative care asap if you don't have any. See about a chemo break and ask to re evaluate your treatment plan. Drs tend to push life saving treatments at all cost. They forget the toll it takes and if your younger than average or appear strong this is doubly so.

hailhell,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_rfqzkr,2,hohqagl,"It just depends. As a disclaimer, I'm not trying to be a downer in any way at all. I've researched liver cancer quite a bit since my dad got his diagnosis. He was also a non-drinker. 


Survivability is based on many things. How old is your dad? Where has the cancer spread to? It's he eligible for transplant? 


If he's not eligible for transplant, liver cancer is a very grim diagnosis, especially stage 4. Having hepatitis or cirrhosis vs not having it doesn't really affect prognosis at this point. I don't want to come off like I'm counting your dad as a statistic at all with this info, but the 5 year survivability rate of late stage liver cancer is 3%. 


I'm not saying that you shouldn't have hope. I just want you to be prepared for what to expect. My dad was not eligible for transplant, nor was he a good candidate for any type of surgery. He received immunotherapy as treatment. Initially, it did improve his energy a little and gave him a little bit of his quality of life back. This effect lasted around 2 months until he started to steadily decline. My dad died on October 20th, 4 months after being diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer. He went to stage 4 about 2 months after he started treatment. 


All that being said, my advice to you would be to get your dad on palliative care ASAP. People don't have to be dying to receive it. This will help with pain, nausea, and fatigue that this diagnosis causes. Thus, it will improve his quality of life drastically. 


Next, you do need to start having conversations about his wishes at some point. At what point does he think he will be unsatisfied with his quality of life? Is he willing to have CPR or be intubated should he stop breathing or go into cardiac arrest? At what point would he like to stop treatment if he isn't noticing benefits and begin hospice care? If he isn't able to make decisions about his care, who does he want/trust to hold that responsibility? 


I know that's heavy, and it sucks to think about. Trust me, I'm still processing everything that's happened over the last 6 months with my own dad. But I'm very glad that we had those conversations and he was able to make informed choices about his life and medical care. When he decided he was done with treatment, we were able to keep him drugged up with anything and everything under the sun and he passed comfortably, the way he wanted to. I'm only bringing all this up because I work on the ICU of my local hospital and have seen the situations people can get into if they haven't made these choices. Family then has to make these choices, and many times they are unsure of what their loved one would've wanted. It's a kind of turmoil that I would've wish on anyone. As difficult as it was to lose my dad, my family was able to fully focus on making the most of the time we had with him and didn't have the added anxiety of making those hard choices in the moment. 


At any rate. I'm so sorry about your dad's diagnosis. I know you said you wanted hope, and there is always hope, but I do hope that you also take the whole picture into consideration. Doctor's often don't suggest palliative care or hospice until long after their patients should've utilized them. No one wants to have that conversation, but it really is necessary. If you want to hear/read more about my family's personal experience advocating for my dad, my posting history has a detailed case study/narrative about the many conversations I've had with my dad and doctors and how that influenced his final days played out. Good luck with everything. If you want to talk more, my inbox is always open.

My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 14 months ago. He died last week.   


He fought hard. He took the strongest dose chemo he could. He did the experimental treatments. He did radiation.   


The result was him dropping 100 pounds in 4 months and being in agony for 13 months before dying, way before he was ready and way before any of us wanted him to go. But to add insult to injury, there were so many things he wanted to do ""once he got better"" that we could have done with his remaining time had he not gotten the treatment that made him too weak to walk.  


Knowing now that he wasn't going to beat cancer, I would have traded those extremely rough chemo months for a family trip to Florida (a former tradition). To go out to eat with him one more time. To visit our favorite places. We couldn't go to the state fair because (1) covid, I'm going to be honest, but (2) because he was in the middle of treatment. A tradition that had spanned 3 generations. We got none of that time together and I am horrendously bitter about it.

Yukicali,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_rixvo5,2,hp1gx47,"You mentioned doctors, has an oncologist reviewed her case?  Radiological oncologist?

It can never hurt to get a second opinion, especially if your mother is still stable and has no symptoms  yet.  Your doctor should be able to recommend someone.  In fact any time you or a loved one get a major diagnosis, and the issue isn't something requiring immediate treatment,  you should always get a second opinion.

As for lack of symptoms, the liver is infamous for becoming very diseased and still be able to function, until one day it just can't anymore.

Some cancers can be diagnostic from scans due to location/appearance.  

While it could cysts or infection, wide spread lumps on liver usually isn't a good sign.


Something similar happened to my mom, her liver cancer was an incidental finding while scanning for a kidney stone.


It was determined due to location/size it was most likely cancer.  They never did a biopsy.

She had no symptoms at time of diagnosis, although some family who were living with at the time said she seem more tired than usual in the weeks before, but dismissed it being due to her kidney stone issues.

She quickly went from no symptoms, to turning yellow, to becoming altered, hospice, and dying within  10 days.

She saw an oncologist around the time she turned yellow, who said she was likely terminal and had a few months, but he referred who to a radiological oncologist to see if they could determine a course of treatment, if possible.

The radiological oncologist stated it was one the most advanced cases they had ever seen, and was surprised she was up and walking and driving just a few days before.  Told us she probably had weeks to a month left.  Recommended palliative/hospice/comfort care.

She made it 3 days after that.  At least it was quick and she wasn't in much discomfort.

It's not even just pain management but symptom management as the previous poster said. In my case, I have severe carcinoid syndrome which can cause all sorts of difficult, and even dangerous at times, side effects. I am stable currently and yet still classified as under palliative care because I have significant side effects that diminish my quality of life. 

It's just like how I am also classified as Terminal by the government, simply because I am incurable at this time. For whatever reason in many aspects of documentation, ""incurable"" is not used as a descriptor while ""terminal"" is. For many, if they hear terminal they assume someone is dying soon. But you can be terminal and live for 25 years more. Terminal just means ""Cancer that cannot be cured and leads to death"" (aka incurable cancer that will shorten someone's life).",t3_rj7cup,t1_hp2ev0m,2021-12-18 17:13:23,/r/cancer/comments/rj7cup/oncologist_referred_me_to_palliative_care_but_im/hp2ev0m/,r/cancer,,

I took her into the ER after a month of her being extremely sick and a little delirious. Come to find out, she has pneumonia AND lung cancer, and the cancer is blocking the lung where the pneumonia is, so the doctors were unable to cure the pneumonia. I cried, and cried, and cried. 

Eventually my mother became more delirious, and confused to the point where at times she couldn't even recognize me. My siblings aren't in the picture, and neither are hers, so I'm on my own. I had to quit my job to take care of her full time. They kept her hospitalized for a week and half before she demanded to be let go. They sent her (very confused self) home with me, and now she's getting worse. 

If I'm honest, I'm so tired. I love my mom to death, but I don't have what it takes to take care of her 24/7. It'd be easier if she was a bit more coherent. But she's becoming more aggressive, and angry. She's started berating me, or yelling at me, or panicking. She won't eat, I change her diapers after every few hours, I clean up after her, I bathe her but at times it's hard to get out of the tub. She can't use her body to help me lift, so I end up throwing out my back. I can't run errands and leave her. And the hospice nurses only come once a week. I'm grateful for my mother for raising me, and I love her dearly, but this is taking a toll on me. I don't want to put her in a home, she doesn't want treatment. I'm at a loss. 

Almost two months and I'm already at my witts end. But I don't want to abandon her like my siblings did. Not when she needs me, and I know its hard on her too. I'm just, tired. And venting. I'll absolutely die when she finally passes as despite everything, we were really close."

gl1ttercake,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_rj7cup,4,hp4zd02,"Palliative care is simply measures to increase quality of life throughout an illness without seeking to cure the underlying pathology. *Palliare* is from Latin and means ""to cloak"". The threat of Omicron is casting a ""pall"" over Christmas, but itself isn't *stopping* Christmas. The flag that is draped over military caskets is also called a pall. You see what I'm saying. It covers things.

Palliative care *does* include hospice, when appropriate, but also pain relief, symptom management, mental health care, physical therapy, radiation therapy, tumour debulking surgery, social work, etc.

Let's take the example of cough suppresssants. They're never going to cure your cough, right? There's an underlying disease pathology that must be resolved in order for the cough to stop. But you can't have a good night's sleep if you're dry coughing all the way through it, which means that it will take longer overall for you to feel better because a tired body doesn't fight off illness as effectively.

A cough suppresssant works on the cough reflex in the brain to stop you waking up in the night, which means you don't miss out on as much sleep, which means your quality of life improves because your body has adequate rest, which means it is fitter to fight what's making you sick.

Also, even if your prognosis is great, anti-cancer treatments are often rough on the body, and so are their side effects. If you have intractable vomiting, you can't keep food down, which means you can't absorb their nutrients, which makes you weaker and also dehydrates you. So you've got anti-emetics, which can't fix what is causing you to vomit – the treatment – but can help you find a way through, keep food and water down, and effectively absorb and use the nutrients and hydration to ensure you're strong enough to continue treatment.

If a provider ever tells you that palliative care is just hospice, *run*. That's a cultural attitude that will permeate the entire organisation.",t3_rj7cup,t1_hp4zd02,2021-12-19 05:45:47,/r/cancer/comments/rj7cup/oncologist_referred_me_to_palliative_care_but_im/hp4zd02/,r/cancer,Oncologist referred me to palliative care but I’m stage III?,"My oncologist referred me to palliative care and my appointment is Monday.

Sadly most physicians don’t have a lot of education in palliative care (or hospice for that matter) during their training so unless they take the time to research and embrace the philosophies or train at a big academic center they may never think to include services like palliative care in their practice. Same could be said for pain management, psychiatry, speech therapy, nutrition, and many other very helpful services that some providers just never think to bring in! I think it has a lot to do with where a provider trained and where they practice. For example, big academic or research health systems tend to focus more on bringing in more services, like palliative care. Smaller health systems, more local-based oncology offices or rural offices tend to keep things more internal and don’t often refer out to as many specialists.",t3_rj7cup,t1_hpazy2s,2021-12-20 15:42:59,/r/cancer/comments/rj7cup/oncologist_referred_me_to_palliative_care_but_im/hpazy2s/,r/cancer,,

The reply saying that curative care &amp; hospice are not very compatible in the system is true for a lot of places I believe. I've known people who have gone through the choice of more treatment vs just being as comfortable as possible. I would emphasize your wants to your team very specifically. Also idk if this sounds drug seeking but I learned from my dad who has awful post amputation pain: do not downplay it! I think we all have a habit of casually doing so even when it's the worst pain ever. the scale of 1-10 thing is so vague and hard and even harder when you've been through actual hell to compare it to. if you're not already, be dramatic about it. I'm not saying to lie but you do have to make others understand how bad what you're experiencing is. I didn't start getting the meds/treatments I genuinely needed until I talked about how my pain was an 8/9.

I would say do not worry too much about being a downer. I think if you are interested there are online groups that could help you and there are some terminal patients. there is a discord linked here as well as a YA server I am linked in. no pressure to join, but [here is a link to a brain cancer server](https://discord.gg/chU2kYBn) (mets patients welcome) you would certainly be welcome in. you don't have to worry about being too down, we all go through it and are at different stages.

I was told at that time not to seek treatment because I have metastatic advanced IV cancer. I was told I had maybe 3 to 6 months. That set the stage giving me very little hope on day one. I completely isolated and ended all friendships. With so little time, my bucket list went out the window within a couple of weeks.

I decided to seek treatment despite what I was told and somehow an entire year past. I went for chemotherapy, radical surgery, radiation treatments and suddenly I was told I was in remission which I didn’t even know was possible with advanced terminal cancer. I felt that I was robbed because I was waiting to die every single day.

When I had surgery, the surgeon told me not to worry about it because as long as it didn’t get into my blood, brain or bones that they could cut out the cancer and keep me alive indefinitely. 

A few months passed in remission which only meant that things were not growing at that time because I still had cancer throughout my body. I received some test results and found that I had a tumor in my brain. I think that’s when real terror took over. At first diagnosed although I felt like I went through the stages of grief quickly, in hindsight, I was really only in denial. Now it was in my brain which according to the surgeon meant I was dead.

I insisted on some kind of mortality figures so that I could make a decision about whether or not I wanted to even seek any kind of brain surgery. The radiologist who wanted to do gamma knife radiation surgery had one of his technicians call me. She told me that without surgery, I would live no longer than 3 months. With surgery, she said they expected me to live 6 to 7 months. I had lost my mind with fear so I actually turned off my phone for a good 9 months. I guess in my mind I didn’t see much difference in 3 or 6 months. This was in 2018 and now that it’s 2021, almost 2022, the difference in 3 or 6 months still seems like nothing but in a different way.

Since the day that I was diagnosed I feel like I’ve had no quality of life whatsoever because I’ve just been waiting to die. I don’t know what I could’ve done any differently because I’ve only been able to react or not react and just sit still. I feel cheated for many reasons. I feel cheated because of my age but I can always find someone younger than me who has lost their battle. I feel cheated because I was told not to even seek treatment and years have passed since then. I feel cheated because it did reach my brain which was a death sentence from what I understood and years have passed since then.

After the gamma knife radiation surgery to the brain in 2018 the radiologist didn’t even schedule a follow-up appointment which I’m pretty sure now it’s because he didn’t expect me to live for very long. They found a second tumor a few months ago and this time the radiologist told me that he was amazed at how the tumor responded to the treatment before. I had the 2nd brain surgery in September and the follow-up brain MRI last week.

There was a follow-up appointment scheduled for next February but the nurse called and said they wanted to see me right away. I asked her if there was any change after the surgery on the scans. She said no and in fact, there’s a lot of swelling. She asked questions like if I was able to walk, if I’m suffering from dizziness, if I’m able to speak basically without tripping over my tongue, if I’m nauseous or if I’m able to eat. I asked what the appointment is as it is set up for Tuesday. She said it’s so they can do some neurological testing and talk with me.

Since I got the news I’ve been unable to do anything but sleep. I’m pretty sure it’s depression like a very deep depression compared to what I’ve already dealt with over the last few years. Then just today a new kind of terror hit me. I have felt terror before but not like this. 

I guess my main concerns are lack of medication and certainly not for lack of trying. It just seems to me that at any time in someone’s life that it should be okay to give them medications and especially controlled substances, that it would be now. To get any medication whatsoever has been like pulling teeth and everyone is so terrified of prescribing pain medication at least where I am so I’m at a loss on that because I feel like I should be able to have a much medication as I want when I can barely get any at all. Of course there’s never enough time. There’s not enough time to get the house in order even if I had any energy or really even say the things that probably should be said. I worry about those that will be left behind. The terror, though is something new which is a huge fear of actually dying.

I wish I had faith. I’ve tried but it’s just not something that ever came naturally to me. I guess this huge fear is just a fear of no longer existing.

When I first found out I was ill, I looked at support groups and found that there really are none at least in my area for terminal patients. I read articles about it saying that at regular cancer support groups, a terminal patient can be a downer to everyone. I suppose I am reaching out because I have never spoken with anyone who is also actually dying as we speak. Of course I know that everyone is dying but that’s not been a consolation.

That song by Jason Isbell, Elephant really quite eloquently says some raw truths. One of the lines that has always really stuck with me is: There's one thing that's real clear to me: No one dies with dignity.

I wish I could accelerate the process truthfully.","I'm so tired of being in constant pain and being treated like a circus side show by my family. I have tumors in my brain, liver, lungs, stomach, bones, bladder, and probably more. The oncologist said my liver is ""eat up"", my lumbar vertebrae and both hips also have tumors and they all hurt so bad. I used to sleep on my side, and now I can't. When it first started, they were at least giving percocets, but now my insurance and the doctor makes me get these stupid ass fentanyl patches that don't control my pain, cost a ton, and don't stay on my skin. My health insurance and short term disability and employer has been nothing a pain in the ass from the get go. Had brain surgery on October 14th to remove the largest tumor, then started targeted radiation for the rest of my brain a few weeks later. Last PET scan a couple weeks ago showed growth throughout my body, but my oncologist says that may be my immune system reacting to the immunotherapy, or it could be the cancer just getting bigger. Several months before I was ever diagnosed, my wife and I were already on the verge of divorce, mainly because of my alcoholism, and I was begging God to not be a pussy and kill me. I was kind of hoping I would just not wake up one morning, not have to suffer or deal with doctors and the awful American health care system. My dad wanted me to try a clinical trial at Vanderbilt University, but I just want it to end. I don't care about extending my life, I'm not interested in living a couple more years just to go back and forth to more doctors appointments and feeling like shit from treatments. I just want to be in hospice already and be comfortable, I haven't even had that luxury so far. 

This may not be the place for a pity party, but I don't have anybody else to talk to about any of this."

There is no crystal ball to know how much time someone has with it without treatments. Sounds like it’s time to sit down with “her” (not sure if this is mom, wife, sister, friend, ect) and have a heart to heart conversation about what she wants to do and how she wants to spend the time she has left. The reality is that there is no cure for stage IV cancer, only treatments or acceptance of a comfort plan of care, and it will likely eventually take her life. Have you asked your doctor about a palliative care consult? They can sit down you with to discuss to burdens of treatment and if it’s worth the impact on her quality of life or if a plan of care focused more on her comfort and what she enjoys would resonate more with her. Or even an information visit with hospice so you better know when to call upon those services? Truthfully, there is something called a ECOG or performance status score for Oncologists and as someone’s symptoms increase, they are more bedbound, not eating much, ect it becomes unethical to offer treatment and so that will no longer be offered because the burden outweighs the benefit.

My dad was taken in ambulance to the hospital in the summer for a high fever while on chemo. He was put in isolation. English was not his first language and he spent 2 weeks there as they tried to find the cause of fevers. He was given no pain meds. The nurses were horrible and didn't check in on him. 

When we brought him home 2 weeks later (with no source of the fevers discovered) we found out two things: 1) he completely lost his hearing (turns out cancer mets in his skull did this). Nurses didn't know and we didn't realize while he was in isolation. 2) when he got fevers he would cry and scream in pain. 

He passed away in October and we did palliative care at home fpr 10 weeks after that. But it still hurts to think of those weeks he was alone in the hospital, in pain, and unable to advocate for himself. 

Don't be shy - organize something with the nursing staff, the doctors and your loved one so you can advocate for their care and the best pain management.

My Mam was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer last July with 10-12 months to live, now we are in January, she's completed her chemotherapy which was considered palliative and just to make her comfortable, as a family we all started eating heathly, I've plenty of siblings so we were take turns at staying over and cooking, my Mam would make fruit smoothies every morning, take turkey tail mushrooms, looadsss of turmeric in meals, also sticking to carb rich foods so she didn't lose weight like, chicken curry, spaghetti bolognese, stews. She took the chemo so seriously and made sure she would never sleep for too long or stay in bed. So now we're here 6/7 months later, parts of my mother's cancer has disappeared, she will always live with terminal cancer but she defied the doctors diagnosis and made herself fight and fight. She would take chemotherapy happily for the rest of her life but I do have to say she didn't get any really bad side effects. A few crappy days and dealing with anxiety, but she's still here and looking and feeling a lot healthier. She will be reviewed in a couple of months and if more chemo is needed... She says bring it on ☺️",t3_ry70os,t1_hrnf2hm,2022-01-07 15:58:17,/r/cancer/comments/ry70os/chemotherapy_for_a_patient_who_is_now_cancerfree/hrnf2hm/,r/cancer,Chemotherapy for a patient who is now cancer-free???,"My mom recently had a/her first malignant breast cancer tumor removed. They found it in between two annual mammograms catching it super early. They tested lymph nodes - all clear. They tested for HERS2 - all clear. They did a CT scan - all clear. They told her to do radiation as a “precaution.” She did and she finishes in a week. Now they’ve run her stats through some sort of outcome database and told her she’s on the borderline (20 score) for it to return and again, “as a precaution” she should now do full chemo for several months then live on the chemo pill for another 5 years. All of this will decrease her chances of a recurrence by just 30%. 

Is this common? My mom is in her mid-60s and I just can’t convince her to get a second opinion. She likes and trusts this doctor, she sees others in her town and network locally are being given the same treatment plan for their cancers, so this must just be what will keep her from having to worry the rest of her days. 

I’m struggling not to go kidnap her and force her to have a second opinion! In my mind, given that no cancer threatens her at this moment, we have time to modify habits to make her body not conducive to cancer such as fasting, removing sugar, adding anti-inflammatory foods to her diet etc all under the watchful eye of a qualified oncologist. Mom is not going for that and I’m trying not to assume that my big city doctors are going to know more than my hometown ones that have gotten her this far. I do know that when at my request she asked her doctor if diet and lifestyle changes could help her ward it off, they said no. But this all just seems unnecessary. We saw chemo steal my granddad’s vitality and I’m just so worried. I appreciate your guys’ input as to whether this treatment plan should be questioned or if I just respect my mom’s choice here and prepare for being her rock."

And also, i know it sounds kind of strange, but if it’s terminal, quitting drinking shouldn’t really be at the top of the priority list, especially if he is hell bent on drinking.

He had his first radiation session today and says he is so excited about treatment, but the problem is he’s been sitting at home drinking hard liquor, smoking cigs, and wearing the same thing for days without showering.

He’s severely underweight so has to get a feeding tube. Chemo starts next week, but no one has weighed risks vs benefits with me (his only caregiver), and he’s out of it enough to just go along with anything. His legs are completely swollen with edema and he is withered and weak. 

I need to know what questions I should be asking his oncologists. I do have power of attorney and I suspect he’s quickly approaching the point of not being able to make his own medical decisions.

In my case.... My palliative care prescribed vitamin B complex and an anti seizure medication. The anti seizure meds do nothing for me so they told me to up the dosage for the pins and needles pain that wakes me up, it usually hits me about 4-5 days after my infusion. This pain is not constant and not everyday so I am still unsure if the anti seizure meds work but the numbness and lack of sensation is there constantly. Since this is chemo induced he may recover in time, and the vitamin B complex is to reduce/prevent the damage being done. It is an OTC supplement.

jupyterRises,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_s3oqmv,3,hsn67wd,"My husband's grandmother had health issues her entire life. This past spring she had a surgery and then she just kind of kept getting infections. One day this summer she had an infection that put her in a coma. She woke up, but was delirious and kept getting infections. 

My husband's grandfather was refusing to accept that her time had come. He would tell us his plans to have her walking by the time our wedding came around in the fall. When the doctors discovered almost no brain activity and discussed that she would never leave the hospital because she would just keep getting infections, grandfather was admiate she had a chance still. Fortunately, after he had some time to process, he recognized that it was her time to go and understood that the decision was something he needed to make for her even though it was incredibly difficult for him.

I know your situation is different. Your mom is very young and it's incredibly unfair your family is dealing with this and being put in this situation. I think that you are doing an incredible job being respectful of your mother's wish to have your aunt make decisions as well as recognizing that choosing aggressive treatment might be something your family is doing to make themselves feel like they are giving your mom the best chance rather then doing what might make your mom more comfortable. 

I would suggest sitting down, listening to your aunt and your grandma and explaining how you and your sister feel and why you are considering palliative care. Sometimes people just need a space to process what is going on and recognize that they are not giving up on your mom by choosing not to do aggressive treatment. They are recognizing sometime, no matter how much you want to hold on, you need to let go inorder to spare someone futile suffering.",t3_s3oqmv,t1_hsn67wd,2022-01-14 16:09:28,/r/cancer/comments/s3oqmv/family_refusing_palliativecomfort_care/hsn67wd/,r/cancer,Family refusing palliative/comfort care,"My(27) mom(47, breast cancer w/ mets to spine) was admitted to the ICU one week ago with pneumonia, a fungal blood infection, respiratory failure, altered mental state, kidney failure, and blood clots (which quickly resulted in gangrene of her hands and feet,  requiring amputation.) She has been on a ventilator this entire time, so mostly heavily sedated. When she is awake she can open eyes and shake head yes or no to questions. On third day, they inserted a feeding tube. 

On Wednesday the hospital called for the whole family to come in for a meeting and to see her. Because of COVID, only one visitor is allowed per day except in the case of a patient where death is likely. So we knew this was not good. The doctors informed us of her condition and advised that we had the options to move forward with aggressive treatment, or move her to comfort care. 

They all went with the ""she's a fighter/miracles happen/do everything you can"" route. I did not agree, but couldn't bring myself to say that to the 10 of them. Doctors reiterated multiple times that she is very weak and this treatment is rough. Also stated that even if there was a miracle, we should consider her quality of life. They said things like ""oh there's plenty of things out there that help with mobility"" and ""she's a strong woman."" I was intensely internally smacking my forehead. In the last year she's gotten progressively weaker, more tired, constantly in pain, fractured her spine from aggressive tumor growth, constantly sick from radiation, sick from her cocktail of daily pills, developed diabetes, has been suffering from lymphedema....and so much more... and still she was just nonstop on the move all day every day because she told me she was afraid of resting - afraid of going to sleep because she might not wake up. A nurse at one point started upping her pain med IV and sedation, and she started shaking her head no as hard as she could. Through yes or no questions, she indicated to the nurse that she was afraid to go to sleep. That killed me. But it was also on the second day, when she was better. They said the blood thinners were relieving the clots, antibiotics were improving her infection and they turned down ventilator support. I actually thought she might get out of hospital with just amputations... On the fourth day, she communicated to us that she was ready to go to sleep. 

Yesterday morning the hospital called to say she had developed internal bleeding, and they are not really able to now treat this without making other things worse. And all in all, it's just another serious complication piled on.. But my family said ""you can try though right?"" And the doctors had to say yes, but again advised we could revisit comfort care. ""Mmm. Maybe if something else comes up, but keep doing what you can."" They keep insisting she is getting better despite all evidence of the contrary. I worked up the courage to let them know that I didn't agree. My mom would not want this. She is uncomfortable, in pain, helpless and knowing her well enough, feels completely undignified and is experiencing mental distress knowing that we are there crying over her. They simply said ""She's not in pain. They're giving her meds for that. Let's pray""

Religion brought her a lot of comfort when she got sick, and I know that she is at a point of accepting death and going home. She would be thrilled to feel comfortable, have no pain, and see her family smiling at her before she finally goes to sleep. I'm sick and pissed off that they are so in denial, and I will lose my fucking mind if she dies in that ICU alone and in distress"
lucidcheesedream,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_s5zxuw,3,ht1ju5r,"Wow we are living parallel stories. I am a stage 3c melanoma patient diagnosed in august. I was on ipi/nivo then was in and out of the hospital for two weeks for what they said was colitis and an ulcer. I was put on prednisone and they removed the Yervoy and are keeping me on opdivo. 

I was on prednisone for about a month. Insomnia constantly, eating a ton, bloated face. I took my melatonin to try to sleep (it helped a little) but didn’t do much about overeating. 

After my prednisone was tapered off they did a test and found I have adrenal insufficiency. That was part of the problem when I was in the hospital. I hope you don’t experience this!

For the time on prednisone I just suggest this: if you’re feeling more energetic on it try to take walks, do yoga, stay active. Get lower calorie snacks to munch on (pickled veggies, rice cakes, low-fat yogurt, dry popcorn or whatever). Try not to spend too much attention to the mirror.

I think it’s worth talking to your doctor about the leg pain. That doesn’t seem good (but clearly I’m no medical professional)

Remember, your body is doing something tough. It’s going through some shit. Give it some grace. (This is hard, I know). If you have the ability, get palliative care. They saved me multiple times, both emotionally and through helping me get the prescriptions I needed.

the side effects i have had: 
really bad acne on my chin and chest, horrible insomnia!!!!, insatiable hunger and eating with weight gain, peeing a LOT, and mood swings. The newest side effect and the worst is severe knee/shin/ankle pain and inflammation. this pain started yesterday about 4am and it is so bad i can barely walk. i’ve been going through my pain pills like crazy. (that will be fun to get a refill, scared of that) but the joint pain is horrible. i think i’m going to the ER tomorrow if it keeps up (i’m sure it will) hopefully they won’t be a hassle with fixing my pain management.

Most of her suffering and complications were the direct result of treatment. Her cancer was aggressive and within 6 months of diagnosis she was on a palliative care routine. She did very well and was happy for 2 years. However, the radiation burned her skin and caused a lot of pain. It also caused a fracture in her spine and made her sick and tired, lowering her quality of life. Her cocktail of pills caused a host of issues for her including dependency and mental/physical distress. The steroids she took caused diabetes, arthritis and ultimately caused her to develop pneumonia and another infection. Treatment also caused her blood clots. The clots and infections are ultimately what killed her.

Everyone's body will respond differently to everything, but after reading similar experiences, i have a new perspective on treatments. I think it is great up to a certain point, and then it may be best to forgo some things for increased QOL. My mom wanted everything to work and to be around as long as possible, but treatment shortened her time and caused more pain than the cancer itself.

I wear a super stretchy bra that clears my port, a cami top, a cardigan sweater over that and another light jacket or sweater.  Yoga pants... warm socks and slippers I can kick off when I sit down in the chair. Of course a beanie because I lost my hair and a comfortable cloth mask.

avtopsyqveen,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_sezjh5,3,hupy2w8,"hi hi. 29. stage IV melanoma. here’s my story: 
had trouble getting into an appointment during covid for months but finally was able to get a mole removed from my left bicep. came back melanoma. they did a wide excision to remove it from my arm which has left me with a large scar and some skin loss that’s noticeable it’s a pretty large amount they take, along with sentinel lymph node biopsy (i also have a scar on my armpit from this and some slight lymphedema occasionally)which ends up in them taking 17 lymph nodes with 13 positive for melanoma. this put me at stage 3C. i also had a port placement. this was november 2020. after that surgery i was in pain killers for pain and healing. after that they had me on keytruda for 18 infusions. during that time had some joint pain and arthritis as the side effects from keytruda. everything seemed to go well i had my 15th infusion but developed serious back pain in june-november  2021. i had scans done in june with lucency in my spine but they determined it was “probably benign”. after the pain developed, i was continually going to the doctor for the pain in my back, we did another scan and showed the lucency in my L1 vertebrae had grown. in november 2021 we did a spine biopsy (i have a small circular scar) and confirmed my melanoma spread to my L1 and also showed 2 lesions in my t9 vertebra. i completed my 15th keytruda and stopped that treatment. i then received 5 doses of high radiation (i have 3 small radiation tattoos in my abdomen that are hardly noticeable) directly to my L1 and was told i would start Opdivo and Yervoy in December. i had one treatment of the opdivo and yervoy and developed a severe case of colitis from the treatment that landed me in the hospital for almost 10 days. during that time i also finished my last radiation treatment. since the case of colitis i have been on an extremely high dose of prednisone and tapering off slowly so i can re begun infusions which will just be opdivo now. i will re start that in the 3rd. my L1 tumor has also cause my L1 vertebra to fracture my back. i am currently on palliative care team pain managing that pain and the joint pain from prednisone with long lasting morphine and as needed ocycodone. i am also on numerous prescriptions from being in the hospital for the colitis but finishing those soon and doing so much better. i have a neurology appointment to see the treatment. for my fracture, which hopefully will just be a veterbroplasty (cement into my back) and also getting scans to see if the radiation has helped my L1 and to see if we need to radiate the lesions on my t9. after i finish 3 opdivo treatments i will get another scan, and complete the opdivo with two more infusions (hopefully this will put me at NED) however, the pain management has been life changing. so things have escalators for me quickly since this november but i am hoping that it won’t continue to escalate anymore. i wish you the best of luck and please feel free to direct message me if you ever want to talk about it more personally.",t3_sezjh5,t1_hupy2w8,2022-01-29 14:08:38,/r/cancer/comments/sezjh5/melanoma_questions/hupy2w8/,r/cancer,Melanoma questions,"Hi there, sorry for all that have the unlucky honor of posting to this sub.

About 3 years is the median overall survival for metastatic, inoperable colon cancer.

Median survival though is an average. Some people will live less. Others will live longer.

How much of his day is he spending in bed? The bed sore, the ascites, and the severe weight loss suggest that the prognosis is more likely in the ballpark of weeks to months.

I think that you should ask the oncologist about involving palliative care. This would be the specialty with experience in home health and placing a drainage catheter. Furthermore, they may be able to help the parents come to terms with the reality of the situation.",t3_sf7lz3,t1_huqaqx0,2022-01-29 15:45:59,/r/cancer/comments/sf7lz3/colon_cancer_and_ascites_23m_please_help/huqaqx0/,r/cancer,Colon cancer and ascites (23M). Please help,"My (22F) boyfriend (23M) has stage 4 incurable colorectal cancer. I need help, please. We are each other's ""other half"" and are closer to one another than anyone else. The cancer has spread throughout his liver, to his lungs, and now to his spine as well. He was initially told his prognosis was at least two years but that was before they even knew what kind of cancer it was and I am afraid he's showing signs that the initial prognosis isn't correct. He is 6'2 and weighs 129 pounds, and he has ascites. I have read a lot about ascites and sadly know it is not an indicator of a great prognosis. The doctors have drained 5L of fluid off his abdomen twice, and his parents waited 16 days to have it drained the second time... The fluid was built up for well over two weeks before they would take him to have it removed. His parents don't seem in touch with the reality of the situation. I have been pushing for him to get home health, especially because he has a deep bedsore and ascites. I eventually had to contact his doctor myself, show him the bedsore, and have him insist on home health coming in to get my boyfriend the care he needs. His parents are insisting that home health is only for people who cannot move, which I know is not true because I work in healthcare. When he is having bad days he can't talk, eat, or move around for days. His parents do not help bathe him or clean him; he has to do it himself whenever he feels better. I've seen him wear dirty clothes for over 24 hours and go over a week without a bath. He has perked up now because he has had a few weeks off chemo, but starts chemo again on Tuesday. I am concerned that his condition will decline again and he will not have the help he needs. I do everything I can but it is not enough, and he is an amazing person who deserves comfort during this time. They have started trying to keep me out of his room, I guess because they don't want anyone advocating for the care he needs. It's very unusual. He's alone most of the day unless I'm in there. 

Do any of y'all have experience with ascites? Can individuals with malignant ascites have long prognoses? My cousin had ascites from bowel cancer and it was not a good sign. Our family always made sure he never had the fluid built up more than a day. My boyfriend wants a shunt put in to drain it at home but his parents are insisting to him that he's fine and doesn't need that. They are also telling him home health is only for old people who can't move. I feel like I'm going insane; this situation is already the hardest thing I've ever experienced and seeing them treat him like this is about to send me over the edge. I understand denial, and it (of course) hurts me deeply to even think about the worst outcome, but I don't find denial to the point that your loved one isn't receiving the level of care that they need acceptable. His parents are sweet people and have been very kind to let me stay in their home, but I'm very shaken up by what I've seen here. Should I talk to the home health nurse about it next time she comes? Do you all think a patient with what he has should be getting home health at this point? What else can I do to take care of him and advocate for him? I feel like I have a lot of adrenaline right now while I'm caring for him but know it will all come crashing down on me one day."
Bluedyeblues,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_sinty1,1,hva9r9f,"I know many people who took benzos during treatment, although Valium and Ativan seem to be what's most prescribed. I took xanax because I took it before getting cancer, prescribed as needed, *especially* during inpatient treatment. Being stuck in a hospital room high on roids (which they always gave me at like 7 pm) was physically painful. 

Dependency (which is not the same as addiction) can be an issue and timing for developing it varies. I don't know how often you're taking the steroids, but I would think taking that much Xanax every six hours every day for months would risk some dependency. If that's your plan, I would highly suggest doing this under a doctor's care, as they can help titer you down after treatment. You may want to spend part of the day off them, maybe by taking sleeping pills at night instead. Gabapentin can also help with anxiety, along with neuropathy if thats an issue with your treatment and restless leg syndrome, which i got during treatment. Valium and Ativan have a lower chance of dependency I believe, but I'm not sure. It may be lower chance of addiction since they don't give as much of an immediate high that xanax gives.

My (23F) mother (58F) was diagnosed last week with stage IV metastatic brain cancer. She went for a scan to check for a stroke, and they saw 23 lesions on her brain.


First, I’d like to apologize (and ask for input) if my terminology is off, I’ve read that stage 4 IS metastatic? We aren’t sure where the cancer spread from to get to her brain, or if it’s anywhere else, but I am heavily leaning towards lung originally. They did do a scan but my mother isn’t interested in the results. I’d love to know what to properly refer to it as!


I’m unsure of what my end goal is with this post, but I have no one to talk to otherwise. I will take any advise, knowledge, similar stories, really anything at all. Please reply with anything that pops in your head at any point. 


My mother got her diagnosis on February 2nd and left the hospital immediately. This didn’t upset me, or my brother (38M) who took her home, because our mom wants what she wants and that’s that. She also just witnessed her only brother go through this battle just over a year ago; trying every experimental drug and treatment they could possibly find. My memory is foggy on how far along he was, but every time they’d clear it it would show back up in another body part. My mom told me she couldn’t even visit him because of what those drugs did to him, he was a different person, and “already gone”. I understand why my mom hid her symptoms for this long. I’m not even angry. She got to go through however long it was just feeling “under the weather”, instead of “having cancer.” 


She has never shown this but I know she was scared when she realized her symptoms were so similar. She had also smoked her whole life and my uncle had quit over 25 years ago. Her fear became apparent the nights leading up to her scan. In just a month span, she has gone from headaches occasionally to falling down 4 times a day. I’m not sure how fast these things usually happen? (Insight welcome) but it almost appeared as if her fear completely vanished the moment they told her. Kind of a relief almost. She came home in the best spirit, all smiles and just laying her plans out for us. She did talk to hospice (this surprised me) and I know you have to be 6 months or less to qualify. 


She has no interest in getting any further test results, any treatment of any kind, the whole 9. This has a lot to do with my uncle, but I’m quickly realizing just how far along she is. In just 4 days, that feel more like 4 weeks honestly, she can no longer walk at all. She has to be carried to the bathroom, she is very confused, she isn’t eating. I’m going crazy at night thinking about how long I have left with her. This seems insanely fast. I know she has been sick sick since at least October… and I hate knowing that fact. Seemed so slow compared to now, tho. I’m assuming that’s the impact on the brain.


My brother and I are trying our best to not only cope ourselves with this volcanic slap in the face, but to cherish our time with her as well as fulfilling all her wishes regarding her will, assets, property, legal stuff. This is so much in such a short amount of time that I am numb. I’m barely functioning in everyday life. I am 23, married with 2 babies under 2 and 2 step daughters. I still rely on my mother every single day for guidance, help, just a listening ear, I text her everyday. I feel as if I’m literally incapable of functioning as an adult, let alone a wife and mother without her help. 
My brother can’t relate, he’s much older and everything in his life is in order with a backup plan to his backup plan if all else were to fail. 


I wish I knew about how long we have left with her, but she doesn’t want to know and I respect that. She wasn’t in any pain 2 days ago, just weak.. I skipped yesterday but I’ll see her today. Such a huge difference in her pain over the phone last night.

funkygrrl,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_r5osaz,1,hvwngp1,My husband had a resection for cholangiocarcinoma. Turned into a 12 hour surgery and now he's fighting for his life in ICU. I wish he'd never had the surgery. At this point all I want is for him to recover enough to come home for palliative care. His liver is too damaged from the surgery and cancer to do chemo.,t3_r5osaz,t1_hvwngp1,2022-02-07 04:48:50,/r/cancer/comments/r5osaz/to_die_gracefully_or_fight_it_out/hvwngp1/,r/cancer,"To die ""gracefully"" or fight it out","I have cholangiocarcinoma. And primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The tumors are still small (2 cm), but are in both the left and right hepatic ducts and down through the distal common bile duct. I've met with Mayo for a transplant evaluation, Columbia/Pres for a second opinion, and Memorial Sloan Kettering regarding non-surgical chemo options.  I would need a liver transplant and whipple, en bloc. I should hear back from Mayo on whether they will accept me for a possible transplant later this week.

Mayo has already said my tumors are 'outside of their protocol' because they are visible below the cystic duct, and they said they are 'leaning toward no'.  Columbia is willing to do the surgery if I don't eventually fall out of their program (due to spread, etc.), but I've heard Mayo is just so much better given they have more experience with cholangiocarcinoma.  Mayo has also said that because of where the cancer is, the chance of recurrence is high, so the chances of 5-yr survival are far below 50% (they didn't specify more than that).  Per the surgeon at Mayo, they might say 'no' because of all the stress of doing the transplant + whipple, plus the high risk of complications and recurrence, could actually make my quality of life far worse, which is a really important consideration.  But even if Mayo says no, Columbia might still do the transplant / whipple, if I want to go that route.

Here is my dilemma...  I'm trying to decide between taking the chance on a combined transplant / whipple knowing that complications could put me in the hospital (about 1,200 miles away from my wife/children) for a large percentage of the time I have left, or whether I should just go with Sloan Kettering near my home for systemic chemo treatment that might buy me a little time but wouldn't cure anything (I am ineligible for the more targeted chemo/radiation at MSK because it would worsen biliary strictures given my PSC).  Clearly, there is some small chance a transplant/whipple would be curative, but I would hate to miss my last year or two with my family by being stuck in the hospital with complications (the odds of success are low). MSK would allow me to be with my family, but I would only have a year or two of life at most (per MSK).  My wife and I cry every day thinking about this impossible choice.  I know you can't make the decision for me, but I would love to hear your thoughts.  Thank you."

That’s exactly how - what do you want them to take out? If she has no evidence of disease there’s nothing for the surgeon to remove.

Also wanted to add - many patients aren’t eligible for curative surgery (maybe just palliative debulking) once they’re metastatic.

My mom was diagnosed with stage IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in September. 

She finally had a PET scan and it was established that it was non-operative. She had it in nearby lymph nodes, a spot on her lung, and it was wrapped around her hepatic artery.

She was offered palliative surgery and had a stent placed to relieve discomfort in her bile duct. 

They did not expect her to survive more than a few months, that’s how bad it was.

Fast forward to now… she has done 9 treatments of gem/cis/xeloda (I think this is the regimen she’s on?) She has tolerated it very well. 

Her markers are waaaaaaaay down. Like- almost to or at normal levels.

She had a PET and CT done after her 8th treatment… and the results were no evidence of disease.

However, her oncologist says she’s still not eligible for surgery? My understanding is surgery is the only cure. How could she not be eligible if there’s no evidence of any tumors?

They’ve said she’ll move to a maintenance regimen… same drugs, smaller doses. Same frequency of treatment (every other week).

The issue with the frequency is that… she initially was seeing doctors in her city and the care was subpar. We encouraged her to get a second opinion with a physician near where I live, which is 3 hours from her home. She received much better care here and since she was in pretty rough shape at the start, it was decided she would stay with me and my spouse for the time being… but she was adamant she wanted to go home eventually. 

She’s now feeling substantially better and really would like to go home, but the every other week maintenance plan has taken the wind out of her sails a bit, as it basically means that at best, she will spend one week home and one week here… for the rest of her life.

Which brings me to my next question…. Is this it? Do we just watch her do chemo every other week until it stops working? How can someone respond so well to chemo but still have no chance of beating this? 

I’ve just got so many feelings about all of this. I lost my oldest brother to mesothelioma in August and the last year has just…. Mentally/emotionally drained me. 

Anyways, thanks for listening, r/cancer."

My mom refused to go to the emergency room due to a horrible experience. 
My sister had her admitted to the palliative care unit on the 29th for ""pain management"" and then she left the city for work on the 30th. It was just me and my mom and i don't know a god damn thing about medicine. I was getting worried because she seemed so out of it. I didn't realize they were administering her midazolam. They were prepping her for death already. She was totally mobile. She was taking out the trash and taking care of her cats on the 29th. The midaz put her in a zombified state and she was already so skinny. I was trying to get her to eat but she aspirated. I had no fucking clue that was even a thing. We got her transferred to active care after i freaked out on every available dr. She started doing better now that she was getting fluids etc. She was holding a cup of water herself and drinking from it. If we just would have gotten her admitted to there first she could have gotten targeted radiation to her stomach (main source of her pain) which would have really helped her pain. 

My sisters stupid fucking decision and my inability to care for her killed her. Part of me thinks my sister was just tired of dealing with her. She should have known better. She should have known not to leave her in palliative care and let them fuck her up with midaz. Part of me thinks my sister was just tired of caring for her which is also my fault because maybe she wouldn't have been so tired if i stepped up more."

They’re enormously helpful in the clinical setting with all sorts of things and they are not always associated with death.

What is her pain level, is pain an issue? 

Getting diagnosed with cancer is a terrifying thing to experience. Everybody responds differently. I was inconsolable for the first couple of months. I cried all the time. But this is hard on caregivers too and it’s OK to get frustrated and angry.

If you can talk to her doctors on her behalf, they need to be made aware of what’s going on. Getting an oncology social worker involved is a good idea, and involving palliative care is a good idea. A good Cancer Center or hospital understands that cancer has significant emotional and psychological consequences and they need to address the whole patient. A good percentage of people diagnosed with cancer develop depression and it’s understandable why. Those issues need to be addressed just like the medical issues.

At the moment, I am stable on treatment. This is a tough disease though, and I expect to be in your dad‘s position someday. In general, everyone will experience a different path to the end. It depends on where the cancer metastasizes to as to how that person will decline and how quickly.

This is my general understanding of what happens when you run out of options. When there are no more treatment options, your dad will transition to hospice care. What that means is he will no longer receive treatment to address his cancer. His oncologist will not be responsible for his care any longer. He’ll transition to a palliative care doctor. The focus will be on keeping him comfortable and ensuring his quality of life. That can be pain medication, it can be medication to treat side effects he’s suffering because of past treatments, a variety of things. There will be a hospice care team in addition to the palliative care doctor. At some point, he will need someone with him all the time. And that is not covered by insurance as part of hospice care. A hospice care nurse might come a couple of times a week, but someone to be there and care for him around the clock would be an out of pocket expense.

There are not many inpatient hospice care facilities where I live but they do exist, and that is an alternative. It gets tricky financially because insurance will cover the hospice care aspects of it, but not the residential aspects of it. So again there would be out-of-pocket costs.

I’m not an expert by any means, but I have looked into it somewhat for myself. My best advice to you is to talk to the oncology social worker assigned to your dad.

Starshapedsand,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_t4oslv,4,hz1hqd5,"It’s your decision. 

Mine may be best summarized by the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: flying is about throwing oneself at the ground, and missing. I’ve been wrangling my disease for about a decade. As odd as it may sound, I suspect that giving up on a cure, and deciding that I’d sacrifice any length of life for any added function, helped me. Patients don’t make a decade with it. 


At my first round, I didn’t get to decide: I was in a coma when diagnosed. By the time I woke, everything had been done. I needed to relearn a fair amount of basic function, as I’d sustained brain injury. 

At my second, I had the option of medical aid in dying. I picked starvation, and a craniotomy that skipped subsequent pain drugs, expecting that it might buy me a couple months of increased comfort. My doctors expressed that it was an unusual approach, but that it was mine to choose. It worked beyond any expectation. 

Now, it’s back again, stranding me in an unhappy half-life. There’s a lot of pain, and thickening mental fog. I expect to die, but I’ve long made peace with that. I attended to many deaths while working on an ambulance, and I’ve witnessed murders. I also later worked with victims of torture who didn’t die. The experiences taught me a gruesome reality: death is ugly, but living can be uglier. So I long decided that, as it’s fundamentally beyond my control, it’s how I lived that matters, not how I die. I’ve done my best to live well. 

Counseling has helped me. It may take going through a few counselors, but I recommend a look. 

So has exploring philosophy, of all eras and locations. I’ve adopted aspects that work from several, and it’s especially helped me to learn to switch philosophical lenses as needed for a situation. 

I also recommend talking to a palliative care doctor.

Palliative care can happen anytime during your treatment. It happens alongside treatment. While treatment is obviously focused on treating your cancer, palliative care is focused on improving your quality of life by managing side effects and pain from your cancer. Because they are focused on quality of life, they can help you when you come to point in your treatment where you feel your quality of life is so poor that you would rather not have treatment.

Hospice care means treatment has been stopped, and you only receive palliative care to manage your symptoms and pain. And you can leave hospice care if you want. I know someone who was in hospice care for two months, and now has transitioned back to being in treatment.",t3_t4oslv,t1_hz2ktil,2022-03-02 17:13:19,/r/cancer/comments/t4oslv/what_if_i_already_want_to_give_up/hz2ktil/,r/cancer,,
ketogirlfromucf,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_t53g1n,9,hz2p4na,"Palliative Care hospital-based Social Worker here (that is also battling stage3b rectal cancer).

I’m so sorry you’re in this situation. I think the first step is to step back and decide what path you’re on…

Hospice - embracing end of life and a comfortable/pain free/peaceful passing as the goal whenever dads time comes naturally, not trying to prolong time at whatever cost, likely sounds like no more cancer treatments, focus on his comfort not treatments/“what if’s”. This would also bring your medical team to you meaning doctors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, wound care, pain management specialists, etc. Hospice usually offered inpatient hospice services for people at the end of life, needing more symptom management or for respite/time for family to prepare to bring someone home/etc. You receive more support and services with hospice. 

VS

Palliative Care - (in my state, Florida, yours may be different) Focuses more on goals of care discussions, helping you decide next steps/anticipatory guidance ie. Is dad ready to stop treatments or is there something you’re considering. Usually it’s a nurse practitioner or similar, maybe a social worker and nurse but they won’t be at your home daily. In my state, there are no Palliative Care centers so I’m not really sure what that means specifically when you say that. (Are they referring to an inpatient hospice center? Not sure about that so many clarify with some questions on what they includes). 

Once you choose a path, which sounds like y’all are leaning (appropriately) into a hospice plan of care … I would ask the hospital to set you up with a face to face discussion with hospice to see what they offer and what best fits your needs. All the questions you’re asking are thoughtful (especially for your age!! Props to you!) and important and can easily be answered by your hospice team. To be honest,  a lot of families find it best to have someone discharged from the hospital to the inpatient hospice center because it gives everyone time to get to know dad/your family, get his pain/symptoms under control, find a medication plan that works best for him and you all at home, and allows hospice to get all the equipment delivered to home. That way you feel prepared when dad does come home but also if you find that the inpatient hospice center has been a good setting for him you also might be given to option to keep him there until he passes away (this all depends on how imminent his passing is, usually the inpatient hospice centers are not nursing homes so they won’t be able to house him for months but if his time on this earth is drawing near than you will be presented with options). 

I’m so glad you have so much family support. That’s rare these days. Sounds like bringing him home is the goal BUT meeting with hospice to ask questions is an important step to know how pain/symptoms are managed in the home setting vs inpatient hospice. Yes, you can run IV pain medications at home and honesty hospice has so many different ways to give people medications other than just pills (liquid is a common option). 

Give your dad lots of big hugs, tell him how much you love him, remind him of all the wonderful things he taught you and things you appreciate him for, make sure he knows you will okay when he leaves this earth and that you know he is alway with you in spirit/in your heart/in your memories, and most importantly, give him permission to die whenever he is ready. Encourage your family to express similar sentiments. So often I meet families after their loved one has passed and they didn’t get to say what they wanted to or were afraid to (thinking it might hasten the death, be too depressing or that they would cry too much). Love your dad every single minute you can. And if nobody has told you today, I am so proud of you, your thoughtfulness, maturity and ability to put dads needs in front of your own during an incredibly difficult time. ❤️",t3_t53g1n,t1_hz2p4na,2022-03-02 17:40:42,/r/cancer/comments/t53g1n/hospice_care_vs_home_care/hz2p4na/,r/cancer,Hospice care vs home care,"Hi. I guess I’m looking for advice or different perspectives. My dad is 61 and has been battling cancer for about 6 years now. He stopped eating or drinking much last week because of the pain and ended up in the hospital from dehydration. He was hoping to come home yesterday day, but then he fell and broke his leg. I’m his power of attorney, although he’s still making his own decisions while in the hospital. His doctor called me yesterday to ask about his palliative care plan, and if he had a bed reserved in a hospice or palliative care home. I believe he does have a bed available to him at a palliative care home in town, if he needs/wants it. 

His brothers and sisters (big family) are very insistent that we bring him home, and not to a palliative care home. My sibling (were both in our early twenties) also wants him home instead of hospice care. Before he was hospitalized, I know he would have said the same. If he does go home, I’m able to get him a hospital bed through insurance, and we have a few PSWs in the family. Currently he has a nurse come into his home for an hour a few days a week, and apparently we have a nurse willing to come out of retirement to help too. I’m trying to see if I get can more funding through insurance so we could get a nurse there everyday. We have a big family, so he would never be alone in the house. I’m also looking into taking family leave so I can spend more time with him, and if needed i could move into his house too. 

Still, I’m worried and I don’t know what the right choice is. He is in a lot of pain, there’s cancer in his bones and all of his organs at this point. The hospital has him on pain meds through iv, another iv to keep him hydrated, and oxygen. He’s taking a dose of pain meds nearly every 15 minutes in addition to his baseline dose. I don’t think he’ll ever walk again, he also has a catheter. My biggest concern right now is pain management. I’m worried that if he stays home we won’t be able to properly continue the care plan he’s had in the hospital. Since PSWs can’t administer these sort of drugs, I think we would need a full time palliative nurse in the house. I’m going to talk to our family doctor tomorrow about that, I’m not sure how realistic that would be. He sleeps a lot, and still talks to us a bit. I don’t think he’s said more than five words at once. I just know with a palliative care home he would have 24-hour care and pain meds always accessible. We would also be allowed to visit him anytime. I just want to make sure he is comfortable and in as little pain as possible. 

So, I was wondering if anyone has experience with a loved one in a hospice/palliative care home or end of life care at home to share. Any regrets or advice? And if you’re a patient yourself, what would you choose?"

I was so sick that I signed up for assisted dying. They cut back the dose to 50% and it became barely tolerable.  I was then found to be a good candidate for Herceptin treatments.

Try looking into integrative oncology/palliative care for treatment. You might not need it quite yet, but it’s good to explore and prepare. An integrative palliative care practice has services such as a death doula, which is a coach to help you pass in peace (basically the opposite of a regular doula that acts as a birth coach). Some practices will also offer psychedelic medicine such as ketamine that can help with pain relief and spiritual guidance/preparation.

It progressed to stage 4 in 2020.

He had about three local recurrences in the span of his diagnosis up until 2021, plus some mets in both of his lungs that remained stable since 2020 up until now. 
He was treated with surgery, chemo and radiation every year, having a stable period (no treatment) of about 6 months each year before the next recurrence appeared. 
 
In September 2021 chemo stopped working and he was set to start an immunotherapy trial (dendritic cell vaccines) in February 2022. The reason for having to wait until February was that they needed a ""fresh"" tumor sample to produce the vaccines. 
At this point his last pet scan showed the lung mets grew a bit and a small tumor in his peritoneal cavity, which remained stable, so they decide that they needed to allow the tumor in his peritoneal cavity to grow a bit in order to be able to produce the vaccines for the trial. 

In December 2021 he started having sporadic gastrointestinal issues like cramps, throwing up food, etc.. Doctors attributed this as being a symptom of his multiple surgeries since these issues would solve by themselves in the next one or two days. 

At the beginning of January 2022 he had surgery to remove the tumor in his peritoneal cavity and start producing the vaccines for the trial. 

In January 15th he couldn't pass down food through his stomach and starts throwing up bile with fecal odor, gets admitted to the hospital the next day. 
They do a colonoscopy (all clear), CT scan shows inflammation in the small bowel and they decide to feeding him through TPN and put a nasogastric tube. 
Seven days go by and he still can't eat, so they decide to do surgery. 

During surgery they remove three big tumors that were blocking his small intestines, however they tell us that there are lots of very small tumors all over his intestines, which they were not able to remove. At this point he, his family and I are devastated, but still have some hope on the vaccines trial. 

First four days of recovery go well, but on the fifth day when the nurses first try to move him to the shower he complains that he can't breathe, his oxygen levels start to drop and he gets put in oxygen support. 

Two days go by and he starts developing pneumonia. They can't keep his oxygen levels above 91 so they decide to intubate and put him on a ventilator in the ICU. 

During the next two weeks, while intubated, multiple things start to get better: his pneumonia starts to recede, they remove the tpn, feed him through the nasogastric tube and his intestines start to work again. 

After the second week the doctors decide he still needs to be on a ventilator so they do a tracheostomy. 
During this week things start to get worse: he develops a fistula in his intestines and his intestines stop working, so they put him back on tpn. By this point we are told that they can't do anything for his intestines and he would need to be put permanently on tpn and a permanent drainage for the fistula. 

He then starts having internal bleeding which requires emergency surgery. He survives the surgery and spends the next two days at the icu. On the third day they move him out of the icu and connect an oxygen concentrator to his tracheostomy. 

At this point he has muscle atrophy from being bed ridden for a month and a half. He starts getting severe anxiety attacks and some days they have to sedate him heavily. 

A week goes by and his lungs appear to be getting better, so the doctors start looking forward to remove his tracheostomy. 

Four days ago he starts developing a fever and having lots of phlegm which interrupt his sleep schedule. They do bronchoscopic and blood cultures, find a bacteria and start treating him. The fever gets under control and he starts sleeping well. 

Yesterday his oxygen levels start to decrease and they have to increase his oxygen support. At the same time his respiratory rate increases to 35-60 and the anxiety attacks start coming back. 

This morning we get the news that his xray scans show he has pneumonia again and that they don't know if he will make it this time even if is on antibiotics for the specific bacteria that is causing his pneumonia (first one was an atypical pneumonia since the culture results didn't show anything). 

At this point his family and I are devastated, it's been 2 months in the hospital of non stop suffering for my brother, and by this point, it's taking a toll on everyone's physical and mental health. 

I've been taking care of him in the hospital from 8 pm to 8 am non stop for the last two months, excluding the two weeks he was in the icu. His sister and wife take turns to take care of him during the day. 

As for me, I don't mind the physical stress, I had the luxury of temporarily quitting my job so that I could sleep from 9 am to 5 pm and get back to the hospital by 8pm to take care of him.

He has three children and a wife that need him. I just wanted him to get better, but at this point I know he won't. Even if he makes it out of his current pneumonia infection it's only a matter of time before the tumors in his intestines and lungs start giving him trouble again. I just wish he could die at his home surrounded by his family and not in a hospital bed, it's been two months since he last saw his three children.  

I'm sad because he is suffering so much. I'm sad because of the suffering his family is going through. I'm sad because his children are going to grow up without his dad.
I'm sad because a lot of people who I considered my friends didn't even reach out to provide emotional support in these past two months. 
When he dies I truly am alone, left with no real friends. 

I'm so mad at life right now. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent.

Update 03/13/2022
He was put on palliative care on March 11 and passed away this morning. 
Thank you everyone for your support, it means a lot."

She was taken to hospital. After a few hours I got a devastating phone call from my dad, the doctor said the situation is extremely serious, there's a large tumor in her stomach and that something has also spread to the brain which caused the seizure. She would likely be moved to hospice in a few days and would not be woken up if her heart stopped. 

She then remained asleep until saturday morning. Then she suddenly woke up briefly and even talked a little to the nurses. When I visited her later that day, she opened her eyes for a while but did not recognize me.

On sunday however, she woke up and started acting normally. I think cortisone was given to her and that helped. She felt a bit ""slow"" and isn't quite fully aware of the situation. She has had bad hearing all through her life and it has gotten worse with age, her hearing aid device doesn't seem to function so well so basically everyone has to yell at her, making the communication about everything more difficult. Still, the nurses seems very nice and she seems to be doing okay. I visited her again today, and her condition continues to improve, she was walking around the corridors of the hospital because she was bored. :) . According to my dad she has eaten very little in the last weeks, but now she's eating full meals at the hospital.

Tomorrow is her biopsy day and according to the nurse, the note ""Radiation therapy?"" was written by her doctor. They are still trying to figure out what the exact situation is.

Needless to say, this has been the worst weekend of my life. I'm really hoping that at least we'd have some more weeks with her and that she could come back to her home and be with my dad. I'm just not sure why the first doctor (a general doctor from the ER) would say that she's going to be taken to hospice in a day or two when they are now considering other options.

And the reason my mom did not go to the doctor? Apparently she wasn't ""hurting anywhere"". :(

They said it was inoperable and started her on palliative treatment. She had 6 rounds of Folfox and then they switched her to oral Xeloda, which she has been doing 1 week on and 1 week off for the last year. Her most recent PET scan showed significant reduction in the tumors in her colon and liver, but no real change to her lungs. Her CEA stays around 2, down from about 700. I convinced her to get a 2nd opinion last month and it turns out that the lung nodules are benign and the cancer hasn’t spread beyond her liver. This is going to open up other treatment options for her which is great because the chemo is destroying her. I have to admit that I’m really mad that the first place didn’t go beyond biopsying her liver to begin with and I’m mad at myself for not insisting on a 2nd opinion sooner, maybe some of the additional damage could have been avoided.

Kristen00715,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ti6wej,7,i1c6u65,"I'm sorry you're going through this. As easy as it is to jump to end of life, since this is day one of his admission, I think it would be helpful for you to know that even though it sounds like he is very sick and the recent cancer diagnosis makes his clinical status more unknown, there is a chance he will get better, at least for now. I will say, without knowing lab values, where his cancer has spread, and maybe risk of other infection, certainty of my last statement is unknown; however, some IV fluids, antibiotics, probably some oxygen and medications to manage other symptoms he may be having will do him good. I'm a clinical dietitian and work on oncology. I feel for you and your family - it's hard to feel so fearful and uncertain. 

A palliative care consult may be beneficial. Palliative care IS NOT hospice care and it is a wonderful support service to make sure patients are comfortable while they may progress to end or life/hospice care. 

As a dietitian, I will say that if they can feed him safely, please get some supplements or milkshakes on board (and maybe some appetite stimulants, if MD didn't already order). If he is too short of breath to eat much or eat safely, sips of high calorie beverages are the way to go. 

Deep breaths! Right now, let the medical team assess your loved one and do labs &amp; imaging to get him wherever he needs and wants to be. It is okay to ask the medical team questions about progression of disease and that may help you all determine next steps.",t3_ti6wej,t1_i1c6u65,2022-03-19 22:59:29,/r/cancer/comments/ti6wej/my_partners_father_68_got_a_stage_4_nonsmall_cell/i1c6u65/,r/cancer,My partner’s father (68) got a stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis in Dec. Finished last round of chemo yesterday and today he’s being admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and is on oxygen…,"I guess I want to understand better what to expect and how I can be a supportive partner through this process. I feel so confused and helpless.

My partner’s dad finished his last chemo session yesterday (with immunotherapy as well). When he got home he couldn’t get off the couch at all to go to bed or the bathroom. He drank water but was otherwise completely out of it. Couldn’t really communicate. Today the ambulance came and he had a blood oxygen level of 85 and fever of 102 and racing heart of 130bpm. Now on oxygen in the hospital and his blood oxygen seems to be above 90 and he’s more alert and seems stable, going to be admitted to the ICU tonight with pneumonia, just waiting for a room.

He had a port installed in his neck for the chemo and a port installed in his chest to drain the fluids about two months ago. He has also barely been eating and has lost like 40lbs or more, spends most of his time just watching tv on the couch but does see friends every once in a while. 

This all happened so fast since his diagnosis in Dec. it’s been a rollercoaster and I just don’t know what to think or expect. No one in the family is talking about end of life plans, just supporting him in getting better. My partner’s mom is a wreck though. She’s doing so much but really struggling physically and emotionally. 

Has anyone been through this? What should I expect? How can I be the best and most supportive partner?

To me it seems like the end is getting close but no one is talking about death so maybe I’m wrong and this is all part of the process.

My partner and I have been together for 6 years and last week we put down a deposit for a wedding in May 2023. We haven’t told anyone yet. Part of the motivation was that our dream venue had a big discount running but also we hope his dad can be there… I frankly don’t expect him to but the sooner we do get married (without rushing it too much), the better chance there is that he might be able to be there?

My partner also encouraged me to go ahead and book a 3 week trip overseas that I’ve been wanting to go on next month. I travel alone a lot for work and to see friends and because I enjoy it, so this is normal for us. I asked if he was sure and he was like yeah, do it, my dad will be done with chemo by then and things should be more stable and it will be fine. I asked him over and over before booking it and he genuinely was so supportive. But now with everything happening today I am feeling bad and anxious about it again. 😞 If anything takes a turn for the worse in the next month I can always change the plans before leaving or just take an early flight home I guess.

Sorry, this is a lot of rambling. I just am feeling lost and confused and sad. And wondering how much I should be modifying my own life and plans right now given the situation. 

Also like I’m not living in the same reality as everyone else when it seems like he’s perhaps close to dying but no one is talking about death at all? So I don’t know what to believe. I’m not a doctor, I guess. I should just trust that the oncologists would say something if he were close?

Edit - based on x rays tonight they are recommending hospice care now because the cancer has gotten worse despite the chemo. :( They almost had to intubate him so we all came down but they were able to drain his lungs and stabilize him at the ICU before it came to that."
neonstarseed,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_tj1pak,9,i1hn6xg,"Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer is most definitely terminal. There is no cure. It can be treatment palliatively which can halt or it's slow spread and can provide life extension of years but it unfortunately cannot cure. We see limited incidents of regression in tumors occasionally with treatment, but as it's travel to distant parts of the body with her the odds of that regression aren't terrific. Once in the lymphatic system it can continue spread most anyway.

I'm not sure why doctor would have not been direct with her about this. This is something that we are fully against in our clinic. They did her a disservice by not being direct with the realities of these diagnosis. It sets people up to be blindsided.

As far as the cause we primarily see cancers caused ""by messed up hormones"" in post-menopausal women on estrogen replacement therapy. So that's not likely. Smoking does raise the risk of breast cancer, so perhaps that was it.

I hope this is okay to post. I don't have many resources besides the internet. 

My dad was diagnosed with CC in December they said its definitely stage 3, but possibly stage 4. He finally gets surgery next Monday the 28th to remove part of his colon, part of his stomach and to see if its spread further because I guess the CT scan cant show exactly how far its spread? Or my dad isn't telling me the whole truth. Then he has chemotherapy for a year after. He has horrible insurance and that's why it has taken so long for them to do anything, but he also has a heart that is only operating at 38% so his cardiologist had to clear him for surgery. 

I have never dealt with anything like this. I am his only child. I am taking three weeks off work to help care for him after the surgery and I am wondering if there is any tips or advice you can give me for helping him with his recovery. Is three weeks going to be enough time off? Should I look into in home nursing? What are some things I need to prepare myself for? What can I do to make him more comfortable? 

I'm so anxious for this surgery I'm having chest pain and night terrors and I am hoping being better prepared will help my anxiety. I feel so alone in dealing with this. I feel overwhelmed and inadequate to care for him. I just want to do my best and help him anyway I can.

Bluedyeblues,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_tni0dv,2,i23kucc,"Hey, I'm sorry you're in this spot. 

I had R-EPOCH starting at the end of 2020. 

Theres a bunch of things i could say, this is going to be a bit stream of consciousness. 

It's important to know that you'll start to feel relief from your cancer symptoms very quickly. Like within days. Then the chemo side effects take the wind out of your sails, but they're manageable and expected and probably not going to kill you.

You will probably not be able to work through this chemo. It's been done, but it'll be tough. If you can get some STD/paid leave I would recommend it. 

The biggest surprise is that 3 of the drugs are given in a 96 hr continuous infusion. This cancer responds better if it's continually ""bathed"" in the chemo over a long period. For most hospitals, they make you stay inpatient for 5 days. I could do a whole separate post about being inpatient. Mine allowed home infusion after the first couple rounds, where a nurse came to my house everyday to hook me up and I carried my chemo around in a bag. At the end of the 5th day, they do a quick half hour infusion of the cytoxin, then you hop out of your gown and head home. On the 6th day you go for an outpatient infusion of the rituxin. This takes a few hours. 

The chemo didn't burn or itch or anything going in. The nurses get all gowned up and all, but it's actually not as bad as you're afraid it is. Some people say they can taste it, but I didn't. I could taste the saline flushes though, which I recently found out is because it's going to your lungs and exhaled it out. Weird, right? 

On the 7th day I got, and you probably will too, a drug to stimulate white blood cell growth (Neulasta, but there's a few brands). It was just a little itty bitty subdermal shot, takes 5 seconds and can hardly feel it and it was the WORST. It wrecked me for days. It can cause bone pain for a couple days after, taking Claritin a few days before and after helps a lot of people. 

On the 2 off weeks, you'll probably go to a labcorp or something and get blood tests a few times. You're going to get a lot of blood draws, FYI. You're going to have opinions about your arm veins. 

If you have the chance, definitely do fertility preservation. It's typically covered by your health insurance in this case, if not, the social workers at your cancer center might be able to drum up some funding. 

I recommend getting a chest port if you can. 

See palliative care as soon as you can, they are amazing and they will help with your side effects. They got me my medical marijuana license, if that's something you're interested in. They also helped with pain, nausea, anxiety and other effects. 

Definitely join a support group and/or see a therapist. This is really hard. 

So the big question is side effects. Everyone gets them but not everyone gets the same. You'll probably lose your hair and your nails will get weird. You'll probably be really tired. You may get nauseous sometimes, or short of breath, or have weird food cravings/aversions. You may get fevers or brain fog or sleep problems. You really won't know until you get there, but you have to get there. Your medical team will help you get through it. This chemo regime is right off the shelf, they do it all the time and they know what they're doing and what to expect.",t3_tni0dv,t1_i23kucc,2022-03-25 18:45:01,/r/cancer/comments/tni0dv/primary_mediastinal_bcell_lymphoma/i23kucc/,r/cancer,Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma,"Hey guys, I've been diagnosed with PMBL, and the doc decided to treat me with R-Epoch-DA, has anyone been treated this kind of chemotherapy, and can you advise me on what to expect and how tough it really is?

If it is something like gallbladder then they will most likely set you up for surgery to have it removed. It took me over 2 yrs to be diagnosed with gallstones because my symptoms were inconsistent and everytime I went to the ER the attack would be over by the time they seen me and my liver enzymes would only increase slightly. It wasn't until I told them I would kill myself if they sent me home that they finally listened and ordered a specialized endoscopy. It turned out i had a huge stone in the bladder which would crumble and release the tiny stones which would bounce around the bile ducts but never actually get stuck. So the pain would be super intense and then subside once they dumped out. I had surgery and within a week I was so much better. 

Seriously get yourself checked out and go from there. You can play all the what if and they won't games you want but that doesn't make it true. The only way to know is to tell someone and have it investigated.  And if it is worse case scenario, mets, insist on meeting with palliative care, they will not mess around with pain management.

She doesn't share a lot of details with me, so I don't really know enough about it. Last imaging showed masses in the liver. Had an operation a year ago to remove some type of growth (like a sack filled with liquid, sorry but that's how i understood it). She had chemo for awhile, it was making her very sick so she stopped it as of now.

She lives in Brooklyn, NY, 39 years old, has Fidelis insurance (basically for people with no income).

Right now she can barely stay at home for a few days before calling an ambulance.

They take her and her mother to the emergency room, at first doctors prescribe all types of procedures, suggest an operation. Then they come back saying it's all denied by insurance, give her IV and pain meds and discharge to go home.

Is that really how the system works?

Is medicaid possible for her?

I have enough funds to hire a lawyer if that would help.

Is there insurance I can pay for?

Are there any services we could look into?

Also if any doctor or knowledgeable person is willing to look at her imaging report to suggest possible treatment, I could share it directly. Only paper based report, don't have image data.

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_trjh7t,2,i2ny1ns,"One thing that might help is to have a discussion with a palliative care doctor at her cancer center. The palliative care specialty concentrates on quality of life. Whether that’s helping a patient deal with side effects or users working with patients who are in hospice care to manage their pain, they are focused on keeping patient as comfortable as possible. And it sounds like your sister could benefit from a conversation with them about what her quality of life is now, and what can be done to improve it. Talk about the pain she’s feeling, the stress of struggling to use her voice and her depression. There may be things they can help her with. And they can also help her sort out her feelings about where she is, and what she wants to do going forward.

Another option is to find a specialist at a leading cancer center for your sisters type of cancer and get a second opinion. Here’s a list of the top cancer centers. If you can find one that’s close to you and your sister is able to travel, that would be best. I know that my cancer center which is listed as number 4, does virtual second opinions so that’s an option too. A second opinion from a strong cancer center is always a good option, but especially since she has a cancer that’s very rare, it seems like a good next step.

We just lost our mother in November who had been battling lung cancer. So, we were devastated when my sister found out in January that she now has cervical esophageal cancer (apolgies, wrote it backwards in the title). 

Sis has now made it through 33 radiation treatments and chemo (cisplatin and 5-flouracil); she has a feeding tube in-place and seems to have adapted to it, but has grown more depressed and desperate. Recently her voice has gotten quite poor, and she describes her throat as 'it feels like it's made out of broken glass'. 

I don't know how to help her at this point and whether she should continue on with the treatments. Her doctor said they would try and find some cancer suvivors of similar diagnosis to have an informal talk with her, but that never materialized. Sis has been trying to explore any radiation alternative (e.g. cryoablation) but her existing doctors seem unwilling to consider it as an option. As lay people we don't even know if such a treatment would be appropriate for the type of cancer she has. Just trying to get the doctors to do some imaging scans to see how it looks currently are dismissed with 'insurance won't cover it' or 'well it will be inflamed so we won't see anything useful'.

Any suggestions to where to go from here? Has anyone had experience with this? She's been told this type of cancer is extremely rare for adults under 60.

He can’t eat anything, he can’t make a coffee, he can’t shower, he can’t do anything at the moment.

I have no idea what to do. I have heard what cancer is like in the family but I never knew it would be this hard.

All I am doing at the moment is drinking alcohol to help, and I know it doesn’t help. But it works.

As a healthcare worker, that also has cancer, and has to often have these difficult discussions with families please know that the discussions are not easy for healthcare workers and sometimes it’s really hard to explain to families (or get them to accept) the reality of the situation. I hope you don’t see that as a lack of empathy on the providers behalf. They didn’t do anything illegal. Some providers are just better at delivering bad news than others but don’t let that negative interaction distract you from the big picture of the situation and who is most important (grandpa!). Nobody should suffer at end of life and hospice brings so much dignity to people at the end of life. Some people also live years in hospice so hospice does not always mean the person is dying today. Your grandpa sounds very hospice appropriate and I hope you’re at least able to put your anger to the side for a bit to hear more from hospice about what their services are. They can also bring you counseling and support to navigate all the different emotions now and after his eventual passing. Have you considered asking for a palliative care consult to sit down with that team to hear a better understanding of why the recommendation is hospice and what your choices are? Ultimately, there are lots of people that die without hospice so the palliative care team could also help walk your family down the path of what grandpa needs (assistance at home, caregivers, symptom management, medical equipment, advanced directives, etc) to prepare for whatever time he has left without hospice service too so that you’re prepared and know what to do after his passing (ie. Calling the non emergent police dept, when/how to reach out to funeral homes, etc). Every family is unique in how they handle difficult news and situations.

My research team and I are working on a study about the feeling of unfairness and its influence on mental health in cancer patients. 
Experiences of injustice can arise at different stages throughout the cancer disease - when the patient is confronted with the feeling of ""why me?"" after the initial cancer diagnosis (e.g. they have never engaged in any bad lifestyle choice that could have led to cancer), the case of cancer recurrence or in relation to experiences in the hospital (e.g. surgical complications, infections).
People deal differently with those feelings of unfairness and for some individuals this could contribute to symptoms of depression which have been associated with problematic recovery and treatment outcomes in cancer patients. Our study tries to understand IF there is a connection between experiences of injustice and mental health, WHAT this tells psychotherapists in the treatment of depression in psycho-oncology and HOW experiences of injustice could be prevented in the first place.


If you would like to contribute to this piece of research, are over the age of 18 and have or have had cancer, we would highly appreciate it if you could fill out this survey (10-15 minutes) -

You'll hear very often in these parts about how each patient is different and the Oncology team is the best source of information.  I have some similarities and will likely have the same trajectory. I hope that you can glean some nugget of knowledge.

I 59M was diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma in April of 2020. I had a tumor on my right throat/base of tongue/tonsil/lymph node and a smaller growth on my left side.  Had 30radiation sessions.  One and a half chemo-cisplatin doses.  My kidneys didn't take thefirst dose well.  The doctors delayed my 2nd dose to let me recover and also reduced the strength.  By that time it was too late for the third dose since the radiation was complete.  The chemo/radiation was deemed successful.

First CT scan(October 2020) they saw a ""shadow"" of something on my lungs but not enough to take action.

Second CT scan(January 2021) the shadow was a confirmed mass so I had a VATSwedge resection to remove it.  The pathology confirmed it was the same cancer as before.

Third CT scan(May 2021) metastasis to my vertebrae(which I had radiation for) and several metastasis to my liver.  The Oncologist said my case is not curable and gave me the ""get your affairs in order talk"" and gave me 3 months to 24 months to live.  I'm coming up on one year,  next month.

Next CT scan(August 2021) additional metastasis to a few lymph nodes.

August 2021 started Clinical Trial and still on it.   I am also considered palliative though I've been fortunate and the majority of side affects have been around my infusion days.  I get about a week of side effects and two weeks of about as ""normal"" as a cancer patient can be.

I don't know the definition of fast or slow growth and can't comment on that.

Is it possible your parents know but are trying to spare you bad news?  Or maybe your mom and dad are still in shock and don't know to ask questions?

Is a second opinion at a major cancer center possible?  I'm not a doctor and don't want to give false hope nor doom and gloom but maybe another opinion can shed light or explain better.  And/or maybe you can be present to ask questions?

One thing that helps me and I just learned this like two weeks ago.... do one small thing a day that makes you happy.  Sames goes for your mom, your dad.  Anybody involved.  It can help get through the days.

I was also told to give her some other drug (can't remember the name) for her restlessness/agitation.

A few days before her death she lost consciousness and right after she died white foam protruded from her mouth. I'm a little bit worried that she was given too much painkiller and as a result lost consciousness and foamed at the mouth after she died. The nurses said the foam was normal but I think they were just trying to ease my mind? Also, me and my sister got into an argument in front of her which was very dumb and mum was clearly upset and angry. Could this have lead to her losing consciousness earlier?

I can't stop thinking about it lately, how I might've lessened her time with us. She was also pretty against the extra morphine but the palliative nurses pushed it and I didn't want her to suffer.

My Aunt is 50 years old and she has stage 4 Adenocarcinoma of the lung. It’s spread throughout her entire body (honestly it would probably be easier to name the places the cancer hasn’t spread— I know her heart is one of the organs it hasn’t spread to, and potentially her brain too). It’s in pretty much all of her bones. She was only diagnosed last month, and before that she was a perfectly healthy 50 year old woman. It’s mind blowing to all of us how it could spread this fast and this intensely. As of last week, we were planning on chemo starting tomorrow, and she’d done radiation on her sternum, spine and hip. However, over the weekend she fell and broke her leg. It’s determined that she’s too weak to undergo chemo now, so we made the decision today to take her home and begin hospice care. She’s on private insurance, I think either Anthem or Aetna, and she’s hit her deductible and out of pocket max. 

So, here are my questions. Any help would be so incredibly appreciated. 

1. Apparently we’ll only be able to get a nurse/aide into the house 4-5 times a week for an hour at a time. We desperately need help the rest of the time. I asked the hospice person today— do you know any companies who can help out? She didn’t. We can’t afford to pay privately for care.

I don’t know if you’re looking for advice or not but I’ll share some things that helped my mom through her chemo and still today.
I know you said you were overseas but look into some form of palliative care. They are not just an end of life team and they have more leeway for drugs. Also if you’re in an area that is legalized marijuana look into that. My mother used RSO and then once THC capsules became a thing she switched to that. 
Another thing, maybe drink one of those big bottles of Gatorade the day before your treatment and then again the day of. Not really sure if it does anything but my mom seemed to think it helped her bounce back a bit after chemo.
Good Luck and Stay Safe
You have a support system here if you want/need it.

My husband has stage 4 metastatic melanoma and he started out with tumors in his lungs, liver, brain, femur, and on his tail bone. He did immunotherapy like yervo and something else and it worked really well and pretty much shrunk everything down. 

However, there where some breakthrough tumors and he developed one on his spine and it cause some sciatica nerve pain on his right side. However, he did radiation and that shrunk it down a bit and it's not growing or doing anything. However, ever since then he has had painful, awful neuropathy in his feet and the oncologist doesn't really seem to have an answer on how to get rid of it, what's the cause, what are some pain management he can use for it. He referred us to a pallative care guy and he prescribed gabapentin but it didn't do anything. 

He referred us to a neurologist who was useless. We had to wait three months to be seen and then when we finally made it to the appointment, she had no idea why we were there and had to leave the appointment in the middle of it to pull up his file and CT scans to take a look at his medical records. Like she was really unprepared. She did some EMG test where they shocked his legs with electric impulses and then she told him that the neuropathy was from the tumor on his spine and the immunotherapy drugs (well no shit).  She prescribed him Lyrica now but all that does is make him dizzy. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on what we could try? My husband's quality of life is really suffering. He said if he could get the tingling, pins and needles out of his feet the cancer would almost be manageable. I feel like the doctors are just like ""Yeah, that sucks."""
lmcc87,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_u0yrjh,3,i4a3y2t,"Hey, I understand how you are feeling, my Mam passed away two weeks ago today. She was taken to hospital really late Friday night and it lasted until Monday afternoon, I remember that Monday morning thinking I really can't do another day of this, my poor Mam. She wasn't really ready to go, she was only 59 and fought so hard, but it was lung cancer diagnosed 9 months ago that spread to her brain, so while they focused so much on radiation to the brain the cancer in her lung was somewhat ignored and her lung collapsed. However the week before that I just broke down and accepted that she would only live for a few months longer but even that wasn't to be. It happened within days. There was so many of us around her in those few days, and when we thought this was it she'd end up waking up or saying something funny. Then the Monday morning when the palliative nurse came around and spoke to us and said they were giving her more morphine to make her more comfortable and we left the room to go wait in the family room. I have 5 siblings and a huge extended family, however when we returned, my aunty, 2 sisters and myself, she passed away within 15 minutes. As sad and as heartbreaking as it was, she was out of pain, I think she couldn't let go when we were all around. Jeez I'm crying writing this because I know what you are going through and I just miss my Mam so much. I wish this comes quick for you and your family so she can be at peace.

She looked at the doctor and said I want to fall asleep and it be over. And that’s not how it works. I never thought much about the end stage. My only other experience with this- it was quick with how affected that family member was. But my mom? She’s strong. She’s so strong and the thing is no matter how ready she is my little brother and I are camped out in her room with her while she is still gasping for breath and on palliative care. She has the morphine pump that we have to fight and time on our phones when to beg the nurses for the next dose since they are so overwhelmed and short staffed so she does not wake up from her sleep choking and trying to make herself comfortable. She’s not scared I can see it. But she’s upset. She’s angry. She wants to go and see her dad and leave us to grieve and it’s day 4 in the hospital and we can’t get a straight answer on how much longer this is going to continue. She’s only 62. She was so healthy. This cancer has already taken so much from us and now she can’t even pass with dignity and we have to wait for nature to take its course while I sob every time she chokes or sputters if the medicine doesn’t hit on time or it’s time for one of the timed whatever’s. She’s fought a good fight. And while I honestly never thought she wouldn’t beat it… we are all ready. She deserves peace. So my baby brother and I will continue to watch her and be here for her while our dad takes one night to go home and collect himself before he rejoins us in our vigil.

Fuck this mountain.",t3_u1ewzw,t1_i4eaocx,2022-04-12 06:34:22,/r/cancer/comments/u1ewzw/whats_it_like_to_go_through_cancer_treatment/i4eaocx/,r/cancer,What’s it like to go through cancer treatment?,"

 It’s something like this: one day, you’re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE’S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE.

Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST!

So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they’re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - “GET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU” - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming.

Also, for some reason, there’s someone in the crowd who’s yelling “that’s not really a mountain lion, it’s a puma” and another person yelling “I read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?”

As you’re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they’re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn’t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one?

Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming “GODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,” and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he’s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain.

Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying “can I get some help, I’ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,” and all you can say is “I’M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN’T NOTICED I’M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.”

Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead.

Maybe. You’re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment.

And all your friends come running up to you and say “that was amazing! You’re so brave, we’re so proud of you! You didn’t die! That must be a huge relief!”
Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you’re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says “boy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!” And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is “fuck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.”

My understanding is that palliative is not necessarily end of life. It’s more about symptom management (especially pain) with medicines. While the medical and radiation oncologists focus on treating the cancer itself, the palliative team manages pain and side effects of cancer or the treatment. Palliative can be a part of end of life care but is not necessarily as far as I understand.

Hospice is what is end of life care where it’s focused purely on comfort, and no treatment. Basically sedate the shit out of you and don’t give a shit about anything else and they are horrible.

It may be that your mom's medical team is figuring out the treatment plan. Many hospitals have a tumor board, where a group of specialists review cases and determine as a group the best plan of action. Since bone cancer is notoriously painful, it may be that they're sending her straight to palliative for some relief in the meantime. If so, thats wonderful of her treatment team. I had to wait until I was through my first round to see them, and even then I had to specifically ask for a referral.

Deciding whether to treat and what treatment to pursue is a big decision that will be discussed with your mom. Most doctors will offer some treatment, either curative or life-prolonging, unless *the patient* decides to stop treatment. If your mom's doctor isn't doing that, then you need to see a new doctor.

Either way, sounds like better palliation of your symptoms could help—antiemetics, pain control, mouth, bowel regimens. I know it’s hard, but keep up your nutrition and hydration.

The best chance for cure is surgery/cut it all out followed by additional chemotherapy etc. to kill any additional microscopic cancer that might be left behind if he wants a chance of living a long life.

You will find some academic hospitals with very well versed lung surgeons that would do surgery especially in such a young patient.

Then the oncologist is basically saying we can treat the cancer to prolong his life but we can not cure him with this treatment.

I hope you’re having a good day.

My beloved fiance is a 32 yo male diagnosed about a year ago with 3b squamous cell right lung cancer. He had chemo (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation last year and has been on immunotherapy (Imfinzi) since, with a brief pause for a course of steroids to clear up some pneumonitis. We recently found some new mets in local lymph nodes - all in his right lung except one supraclavicular node. He’s being offered a few treatment options moving forward, and I wonder if anyone here has been through any of this stuff or just has a little 2 cents to give us that might make things more clear. Of course this is his decision to make, and I will support him completely in any case. 

In short, we fully expected surgery to be off the table when we learned that this new lymph activity was definitely metastatic. We were surprised this week when the surgeon on his case offered him a pneumonectomy with lymph node removal, which we would follow with more chemo and radiation as soon as he is recovered enough to handle it. He told us that, while this is a very radical operation, he thinks it offers him a chance at a total cure. He also said that the most recent good literature regarding mortality rates was from 20 years ago and showed about 5% mortality from the surgical complications within 90 days, but that he has never lost a patient from complications in that period. He is only willing to do it because my guy is so young and otherwise healthy, and because his cancer hasn’t spread far in the past year. He suggested that this indicates that his particular cancer is less likely to spread quickly.

We saw his medical oncologist immediately after, and she basically cautioned us against this. Her concern is that the lymph spread indicates that this cancer is already “out of the bag.” She says it hasn’t spread far because of all the treatment he’s getting. She’s worried that he will have this huge operation and be in pain, short of breath, etc and then have a tumor pop up somewhere else immediately after surgery that she couldn’t do anything about. She is suggesting a palliative plan instead - more chemo and immunotherapy but with slightly different meds. When his disease progresses a bit, he would be eligible for a clinical trial she is currently running with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. She thinks this could be a great fit for him, and may offer some hope of beating this thing. Still, it would basically mean moving him from a potentially curative track to a more palliative one. She also had another thoracic surgeon, who is a friend of hers, call him to give another opinion. That second surgeon said she thinks the mortality risk after this procedure would be more like 20% in the following 90 days because he has already gotten so much radiation, making the surgery more complicated. I don’t know if she’s basing this on any literature or if that 20% would include mortality from surgical complications alone or cancer progression as well - he talked to her when I was at work. 

He is currently at Northwestern in Chicago, and the second surgeon we talked to was at University of Chicago. We have requests in for appointments at Rush Chicago (where he was seen when first deciding where to pursue treatment), MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and Mayo to try and get some more expert opinions. As of now, he is planning to get the surgery May 2 and has started all his pre-op testing, signed the consent, etc. Still, he’s waffling. That second surgeon’s opinion definitely made things more difficult.

Any input? Advice? Experience with pneumonectomy, or any cancer surgery after lymph involvement and/or after radiation, or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes? We are determined to get the best medical and surgical advice possible, but would love a little perspective from other patients if possible. Thanks! Sending lots of love and well wishes to you all."

From November 2020 until now, all her CT scans have come back clear and so has her month blood reports.

Today she got the results back from her most recent blood test and the 15-3 marker came back at 28 (26 being the high point).

Usually the people running these stores are super helpful and should be able to answer any of your questions.
I’d also recommend going for a medical card over recreational because it opens more places for you as well as being a little cheaper. At least here. 

A little off topic but if you haven’t already been directed to palliative care you might mention that to your doctor as well. They are not just an end of life team and have more leeway with drugs than your pcp.

It shouldn’t be happening. 

 Your dad’s doctor is saying that even with chemo working, two years is probably the best your dad can hope for. Finding out how toxic that chemo is and how difficult the side effects are, that’s a big part of making this decision. More time being terribly ill isn’t quality time. And people do sometimes opt out of a last treatment in order to feel better in the time that they have left. They would prefer six months of feeling OK than 2 years of feeling terrible. And knowing that their family will be so worried about them during those two years. It’s incredibly complex. These are the hardest decisions to make.

My suggestion is asking for a referral to a palliative care doctor. Primarily yes they focus on pain management and keeping patient comfortable throughout their treatment, and after they have stopped treatment. But something else they do is counsel patients about these type of questions. They would talk with your dad and find out what’s important to him and find out what his hopes and fears are about both not getting the chemo and if he gets the chemo.

My grandmother, the woman who raised me, was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer 3 days ago. Palliative care gave us a timeline of *maybe* two weeks. It has spread throughout her entire body, brain, spinal column, almost every internal organ.. I’ve seen her age so rapidly over the last month. We caught it so late.

Today I went to visit because my aunt said she thinks she might not make it through the weekend. 

She goes in and out. We were talking and she will look at me, mouth drooping with dead eyes, grab me and shout “I’m not ready to die! I don’t want to die!”, “I’m scared! Help me please” Over and over. Then continue our conversation. She pointed next to me and said “does Marty know I’m dying?” Marty is her husband who passed 5 years ago.. she also mentioned seeing her deceased mother sitting at the end of the bed. 

She told me “I want to die in my sleep”, I said “you will nana, it’ll be like a dream”. She laid down and fell asleep while I rubbed her back, she turned over eventually and told me “your touch is so gentle and comforting, I want you doing this when I go”. 

She hasn’t passed yet. She’s very scared. She kept telling me how scared she is and I feel helpless because all I can do is watch as she dies. 

I’m grateful I have this time though. I am very grateful I can love her and paint her nails, brush her hair and decorate her room for her. I know she will go soon. I just don’t want her to be afraid.

Im not sure what I’m looking for, I guess I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I’m in shock after my visit today, that was fucking hard. And I feel like I understand death well, I don’t think of it as a loss.. it’s something that happens. I just hurt because she is so scared."

And I can't get over the fact that it could have been caught so much earlier if my oncologist hadn't been such a fucking big headed moron!

I was initially diagnosed in November 2020, with an 8cm tumor in my leg. Four months of tests and scans later, they took out the tumor with clear margins. My oncology surgeon said it was a Paraganglioma, a rare type of High Grade Neuroendocrine Tumor, which some doctors do not consider to be cancer (?!!!). I asked whether some blood tests to be done, which are usually required for Paragangliomas. My oncologist refused and yelled at me, saying only HE can demand tests, it's not up to me to ask for tests. He insinuated I was taking advantage of the system, as I ""had gotten more scans and tests than any Canadian citizen"" (I'm an immigrant - and surprisingly, so is he!). It was alarming to get yelled at, so I backed down (the nurse, bless her, later on put me in touch with an Endocrinologist, who requested said tests without me even asking). 

Because the surgery was with clear margins, they said I was cancer free. See you in 3 months. Three months later, in July 2021, they did another set of scans. Still ""clear"", see you in SIX months. Six months later, December 2021, it turns out they were wrong and I don't have a Paraganglioma- they still don't know what i have for sure till today. I came for scans and found mets everywhere - my bones, my abdomen, multiple mets in both lungs. The bone mets caused a microfracture and I needed a nail inserted immediately. I am in a lot of bone pain. The abdomen mets were a 6cm tumor (have grown to 11cm by March 2022 when my first line of treatment failed spectacularly).

Now I'm finding out, when reading my past reports, that in July 2021, the scans showed a few mets in my lungs,already a few mm big. I asked the oncologist about WHY they didn't do anything about them then, and he says they were not visible on the images. But the REPORT says there were visible spots. If yes, then WHY didn't they ask to see me in 3 months? Why move the meeting to 6 months?? 

I know I should have read the reports. I was too trusting, and I didn't. I was also being followed by another hospital, and I sent them the reports as well, but they didn't read it/didn't catch it either. And now I am so fucked, the mets keep growing and nothing seems to be stopping them. I switched to another oncologist, but he won't tell me Anything (didn't tell me I now have mets in my spine), he is so closed mouthed about shit, I fear he might send me to palliative care to die without even telling me in my face that things haven't worked (he's done this to another patient). 

I mean, stage 4 is stage 4, right. Given that I always had an unknown primary from the very start, it can be argued that I was always stage 4, even back in November 2020 (they never told me the stage then). But stage 4 with a few lung mets just sounds a lot more ""manageable"" than Stage 4 with so many freaking mets! One could argue that I got like 6 more months of ""peace"", unaware of the madness already growing inside. But man, I am just so mad. At the oncology surgeon, who kept smugly saying even at our last appointment that he ""always knew that something was off with this tumor"". Well being a smart ass did fuckall to me in the end, didn't it."
smhxx,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_i6s4us9,8,i6si80i,"Have you looked into home hospice options? There are services that will come to your place of residence and provide palliative care to help keep you comfortable without needing to go to a physical hospice facility. Might be an option worth exploring if you haven't already.

I think it would also be worth having a discussion with your doctors about goals of care. Make sure that they know what you want, both right now and in the coming days or weeks. For example, do you *want* to be able to eat more, but you simply can't tolerate food, or don't have the appetite? How much of your desire to move on is due to the unaddressed pain you're experiencing? Would you be open to efforts to preserve your life if the pain were better controlled, or do you just want to be comfortable for long enough to have a good death? You don't have to answer those questions to me, but make sure that those who are providing your medical care know what you're thinking so that they can help you in whatever way is most meaningful to you.

When I worked for hospice previously we met patients all the time allergic to a lot of different medications but were always able to find a way to alleviate the symptoms.

ketogirlfromucf,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ugce5z,23,i6zcs2p,"I think all of us can agree that being thorough is extremely important. When structuring a conversation always introduce yourself (every time, unless the person says your name), your specialty and your objective in being there. So often medical professionals just walk in the room expecting us to know who they are and what they are going to do. Don’t assume. 

Explain to us what you know thus far and what we need to know and anticipate going forward. Help us understand the side effects and make sure you verbally and written form tell us what to do for different side effects because we will not remember everything you said. 

Don’t shy away from the tough conversations. Be honest. Be compassionate, we are real people. As a healthcare worker (in palliative care) myself, being human and honest with people and not just giving them fluffy overly inflated expectations can make a world of difference. For me, watching an elderly person with widely metastatic cancer receive whole brain XRT at the end of their life because the family is grasping at straws is one of the toughest scenarios for me to watch and it’s so important to set realistic expectations and prepare them for the side effects/personality changes/lethargy/etc that can happen on this path.

Don’t be afraid of the hospice word when appropriate. 

Don’t be afraid to celebrate with people - try to remember if someone mentions their anniversary the next day or birthday if admitted, acknowledge it!!

I received my cancer treatments at the Mayo Clinic and one of the things I loved they did across the whole system was end every conversation with “do you have any more questions” or something along those lines. Usually I would say no. They would repeat “Are you sure, no more questions, I’m here” and 99% of the time I would think of a question haha and they would ask it one more time until I had no questions. It really made me feel validated.

Radiation therapy specifically is a well oiled machine usually and it’s strange how seeing the familiar faces everyday for weeks on end and people taking a small interest in your personal life can make all the difference.

.  If you're late for the appointment, begin with a brief apology. ""Sorry for keeping you waiting ...""
. Come prepared for the appt. Open issues, scan results, latest options. I've done my homework and I appreciate it when it appears you've done yours.
. My neuroendocrine cancer (NET) is stage 4. But it is not uncommon for stage 4 NET patients to live 20+ years with NETs.  That said It really doesn't help to hear ""benign-ish"" or to have a Dr not see that it is a chronic and life disrupting disease.
. Look beyond traditional treatment. When I continued to feel badly even though I was receiving monthly treatment and my tumors were stable my NP and Endo Dr did more labs and prescribed B7, B12, and VitD.  My NP went further to suggest I consider changing my diet to whole plant-whole food WPWF Dr. Greger.  She knew of others that had switched and it had helped them feel better. (NP didn't personally follow the diet. I'm a 61 yo female, runner, no weight issue) 3-4 weeks later I began to feel better and have stuck with it since Aug '21.
. After all treatment options are in motion, another option is to suggest Integrative and Palliative care services. They have been helpful to me and they help round out a patients team of support.
. Encourage questions about the disease, treatment options. Not all Dr/NP like to be questioned.

Unsure of how to navigate,"My father-in-law was admitted to a community hospital for biliary obstruction due to a malignancy    suspected to be cholagiocarcinoma (potentially Klatskin tumor). Throughout his time here he experienced a series of setbacks (ERCP that resulted in a significant migration of patient's CBD stent, persistent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, a subsequent ERCP for stent placement for decompression to reduce his high bilirubin levels, and an external PTC drain placement prior to the second ERCP). 

Since then he's been transferred to a ""better"" academic medical center but I feel the team there has been moving incredibly slow. He's received two inconclusive biopsy reports, his PTC drain has suddenly fallen out, and now they've discovered another ""mass"" in his bladder that the hospital needs to resect. The tumor board couldn't come to a decision on what action to take next due to the inconclusive reports and it feels like the team is just going in circles. Anyone I talk too keeps deflecting my questions and I'm unsure of how hard I should be pushing here to get something done. He's been in the hospital for almost a month now and we still have no idea what exactly he's facing and how to prepare for it.

If this is indeed cholangiocarcinoma, I know this form of cancer is rare and aggressive. I'm worried if I keep waiting for the hospital to take initiative we're going to lose him. Is there something more I can be doing here to incentivize the hospital to take action quicker? I want to trust that the team is doing their best but I'm getting pushed to my limit here.

A palliative care doctor will focus on her quality of life and what can be done to minimize the side effects and make her more comfortable. 

She can also get a consult with a nutritionist who works with cancer patients all the time and can make suggestions about how to keep her hydrated and keep her nutrition up while she’s suffering the side effects. Wherever she is getting treatment should have nutritionists on staff.

Patients need to advocate for themselves. They need to ask for these things themselves. The resources are usually there but unless a patient actively requests them, a lot of oncologists are not good about making those suggestions themselves.

This week has been awful, the pain in his rib just continues to get worse and it’s terrifying seeing him deteriorate so quickly. He’s gone from walking and being mobile to being crippled in pain he hasn’t left his bed/chair and now needs a walking stick to get about and it still takes it out of him completely. 

He’s started slow release morphine which seemed to be helping a lot, but today despite me warning him to not over do it, he went ahead and over did it. He got up at 6:30, showered, visited my grandma and while it isn’t “a lot” it’s a lot when he hasn’t left the house or showered in nearly a week. And now he’s suffering with severe pain again. 

He describes it as a spasm which affects his stomach, chest and back all at once. 

He has a biopsy on Wednesday to determine treatment, and I’m terrified they will realise they were wrong and they can’t actually offer him treatment. 

I don’t know what I want from posting this, but I’m just struggling seeing my dad go from active with pain every few hours to in less than a week being immobile, in agony and not even being able to leave the house without unbearable pain."

They reassured us that he has been referred to them a lot earlier than expected, but not because he’s at end stages but because of his painful rib. That’s when he was prescribed the slow release morphine. 
From what I gathered from our conversations with our lung cancer doctors/specialists is that even though he has mets, it still is in “early stages”. His liver has only JUST started to become cancerous, and so has his rib/2 bones on his spine, and his lung cancer despite being the origin is not overly “infected” with cancer, it’s still in just a small area. They seem to think that he may be able to live with his cancer for a long time as a “chronic condition” rather than a death sentence, but ultimately only the biopsy will reveal the true nature of it.

_-Loki,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_uqjdm0,13,i8roei5,"If nothing has changed, ie. she hasn't had any treatment or been given any drugs, this is likely psychological in nature. Now she knows something serious is wrong, she feels it more, or perhaps is just allowing herself to show it more.

The weight loss could well be caused by the cancer, I thought I was losing weight because my mental health was improving, before my diagnosis. Now I realise the tumours were taking up so much room my stomach capacity had shrunk.

I went to the doctor for something completely unrelated, low blood count had the doctor admitting me to hospital the same day. The next day I was diagnosed. I asked to read my CT report (I trained in radiotherapy, although I never worked in the field) and I knew from reading that, I was terminal.

I've tried to remain positive, and I honestly believe this is harder on those I'll leave behind than me.

I'm on palliative chemo, I'd have had 2-4 months without it.

I just finished my first round of 6 fortnightly doses and honestly, that's been harder than just having cancer. I had very few symptoms, now I spend 20-25% of my time feeling like crap and feel pain every day. I'm on slow release morphine and I have a morphine syrup for breakthrough pain, together they work well to keep me mostly pain free.

But the alternative is 2-4 months. With chemo I might have 2 years, the average is 18 months.

I wrote myself a bucket list. In doing so I realised I didn't actually have much I was missing out on. It's things like getting a tattoo, having a proper afternoon tea, karaoke, visiting a seaside arcade (I grew up near the sea and spent many a fun hour in the arcades).

Then an old schoolfriend of mine announced she was going back to uni for her masters and I realised I couldn't do that. There would be no more course changes for me. I might have time to train in something new, but not work in it. That hit me hard.

Then I asked myself what changes I'd want to make? I've changed profession a few times, now I'm a dyslexic writer. After self publishing for a few years, I've fulfilled my dream of being traditionally published for my last 2 books. It doesn't pay much but it's my dream job, and the NHS is free so I don't have to worry about healthcare costs.

I wonder if I'll write my magnum opus in the coming year, but right now I'm too unsettled to write. See, I'm not all positivity and look on the bright side. I cry sometimes, but I cry alone, I can't cry in front of other people.

And that was a joke about my magnum opus, my books are fun stories, not deep.

People keep telling me how brave I'm being. I don't feel brave, I just don't want to die in 4 months, so I don't really have much of a choice.

What I do know is that I don't want to waste these final 18 months wallowing. I think I may well live more in the next 18 months than I have in the previous 40 years. I'm making a conscious effort to spend time with those I love, and make memories with them, have new experiences, and do things I enjoyed in the past again.

I'll learn how well this round of chemo went on Thursday. If it went well, I'll do it again after a break (I need to heal. Literally. Sure, it kills the cancer but it's basically poison and it harms me too). If it didn't go well, then that's a conversation I'll need to have with my doctors.

Now that she knows the diagnoses…it has been a total downfall.
She’s like maybe around 20lbs. Stays in bed all the time, is in pain. Her speech is a bit slurred.
Is this just a rapid decline in health due to the cancer? Or a sort of deep depression.

Tomorrow we see the oncologist. Hopefully we can start treatment asap.

DisciplineCertain397,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_uqx886,2,i8ulwdy,"I think this is a tough question because many of those  things are part of advanced cancer. My short answer is to talk to the pain clinic  at the hospital  (may or may not be separate from palliative/hospice) and find the things that give you happiness that you are still able to do.

With my mom, she is trying to figure out what makes her happy. On a not bad day, she has 1-1.5 hours a day when she can do something.  I think  she is zeroing in that she wants to go for  a walk and play guitar.  When people  visit, she sits where she is most  comfortable. She is at the lowest dose she can  tolerate the pain  with  because she doesn't like sleeping  through the day but she has to have a high  enough dose she can  tolerate it.

This isn't cancer but when my dad was diagnosed  with MS, it was a huge depression episode. He was a very sports oriented guy. He had to stop working within a year due to symptoms  and his wife left him because she wanted to be taken care of not be the one taking care of someone.  It took him a good 5 years to figure out what he could do.  He said one thing he regretted was he spent the first 5 years chasing his friends away and not doing sports he loved. By the time he got back to them  in a modified  way (like instead of golf, just hitting balls at a driving range) he was way worse than he would have been originally.  He also found other interests like sports weren't as interesting  to him and couldn't  hold his focus to watch but he realized he really liked musical  theater  and found a friend  who he could reliably go with.",t3_uqx886,t1_i8ulwdy,2022-05-16 18:21:44,/r/cancer/comments/uqx886/how_can_someone_get_a_better_quality_of_life_with/i8ulwdy/,r/cancer,How Can Someone Get A Better Quality Of Life With Advanced Cancer?,"Someone close to me was asking how they can have a better quality of life.

Just as an example, my 75 yo mom with Lung cancer was scanned every 3 months and followed very closely.  Me, 43, with ovarian cancer, had full hysterectomy, chemo and then..... nothing.  Just pelvic exams, no scans, until last year a horrific Bowel obstruction landed me in the ER and the cancer was found to be all over abdomen and on my liver.   I was beyond frustrated that no scans had been done earlier.  They were talking about palliative care for me (I was 48 then, 49 now).  Why should ppl with lung cancer get more scans and better follow ups? It makes no sense.   
And my oncologists response to me pressing for more is always: ""More scans don't lead to better outcomes"" (in other words, you're going to die eventually anyways, better off not suffering from chemo for as long).
And while I hate what she has said to me every time, here's the part that finally redeemed things in my mind.  With my recurrence last year, I had a full 4 years post chemo before I had to go through chemo again.  No surgery.  But the result after 6 rounds of chemo?  All ascites gone.  A 6 cm tumour, gone.  A 1 cm tumour on my liver, gone.
So while I initially resented that I wasn't diagnosed and treated sooner, I found myself thinking that I had 4 years of feeling good, getting long hair, and not having to go through chemo.   And in the end I'm cancer free again.  
While it sucks that your mom has a likely recurrence, her onc feels it's small enough to wait and see.  What if it doesn't grow? Would it be worth treating her now and making her sick and suffer from the trwatment?  It's hard to say.   I know gor sure though, if I was in your mom's shoes, I would want the surgery to remove that piece, and for that reason alone I hope she decides to try for a second opinion.  Even in Canada she does have the right to that.  If you're in Ontario, I did actually go through that route - on Princess Margaret hospital website there's a form you can find for second opinions - either surgical or chemo based.  I chose surgical because I desperately wanted it at the time.  The PM surgeon wound up convincing me that the plan my oncologist had was really the best for me at that time as the surgery carried its own pretty severe risks.  
One question- is your mom on a Parp Inhibitor at all, because if not she should definitely discuss that with her oncologist.   I wasn't on one before this recurrence but I am now.",t3_urabzx,t1_i913awr,2022-05-18 03:03:24,/r/cancer/comments/urabzx/moms_cancer_has_returned_but_doctors_wont_do/i913awr/,r/cancer,"Mom's cancer has returned but doctors won't do anything, WTF!!","So my mom's scans have pretty much confirmed her cancer is back, this time with a tumor on a lymph node. In March 2020 she was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer (serous carcinoma was the actual term).
After a successful first round of chemo treatment and surgery, she was cancer free from August 2020 until now. 

The scan has only detected the one tumor on her lymph node and now her oncologist says that surgery or another round of chemo would be jumping the gun. So they want to wait another 2 months to do another Scan and ""see what happens."" They've also booked an appointment with a surgeon in 4 to 6 weeks for his opinion.

Like what in the actual Fuck?! You'd think the logical step would be to get rid of the cancer while it's still in its infancy this relaps.

My dad has small cell lung cancer, it was diagnosed late since there were no signs, but his state has been declining extremely fast. He has gone from a fully functioning adult to a confused man that can't stand on his feet in a matter of three weeks, day by day it's getting even worse, he's delirious, agitated, can't remember how to do regular things such as taking clothes off or turning on a switch, loses train of thought incredibly quickly, doesn't seem to hear, so many more things and it's tearing me apart.

I am so incredibly angry at the world, it made sense in a weird way for him to develop lung cancer and all of us including him would've coped so much better, he's been smoking for most of his life and has family history, but why the turning into a toddler????? I can see it on his face that he knows there is something incredibly wrong and that he is frustrated he can't put his finger on it, I don't even know if he understood he has cancer, I can clearly see he is scared whenever we don't understand him and it's horrible. I can't understand how it got so bad so fast, before these three weeks started he had some difficulty understanding some things, but nothing that stood out, I know I missed the signs and I'm it's even more infuriating that I don't remember the start of the decline, everything was just so incredibly fast, one day he falls when going to the bath, the next he speaks gibberish and sleeps for 20 hours a day. I'm absolutely gutted and I'm fully aware that it's the end, the petscan hasn't arrived yet but it can't be hopeful, it's just too fast and too aggressive to be any hope left.

My dad has small cell lung cancer, it was diagnosed late since there were no signs, but his state has been declining extremely fast. He has gone from a fully functioning adult to a confused man that can't stand on his feet in a matter of three weeks, day by day it's getting even worse, he's delirious, agitated, can't remember how to do regular things such as taking clothes off or turning on a switch, loses train of thought incredibly quickly, doesn't seem to hear, so many more things and it's tearing me apart.

I am so incredibly angry at the world, it made sense in a weird way for him to develop lung cancer and all of us including him would've coped so much better, he's been smoking for most of his life and has family history, but why the turning into a toddler????? I can see it on his face that he knows there is something incredibly wrong and that he is frustrated he can't put his finger on it, I don't even know if he understood he has cancer, I can clearly see he is scared whenever we don't understand him and it's horrible. I can't understand how it got so bad so fast, before these three weeks started he had some difficulty understanding some things, but nothing that stood out, I know I missed the signs and I'm it's even more infuriating that I don't remember the start of the decline, everything was just so incredibly fast, one day he falls when going to the bath, the next he speaks gibberish and sleeps for 20 hours a day. I'm absolutely gutted and I'm fully aware that it's the end, the petscan hasn't arrived yet but it can't be hopeful, it's just too fast and too aggressive to be any hope left.

How can I start dealing with everything? I'm furious at myself and at the world in general, took a strong charismatic man and turned him into a little kid and I can't feel anything else but pure anger"

My dad had problems with his colon (didn't go the restroom for about a week) and got hospitalized the second time he went to the ER where he got an urgent surgery. Well it turned out to be stomach cancer which metastasized a ""little"" bit (that's what they said) in this area. At this stage they are talking about palliative care.

I'm confused. We have not spoken with the oncologist yet because he needed to rest after the surgery. The only thing they said was he'll get a catheter for his chemo meds. He has lost SO much weight in this 3 weeks being hospitalized and his appetite vanished (no chemo yet!).

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_usswp8,5,i95xr4v,"I’m so sorry to hear about what your family is going through. Do you have an oncology social worker for your mom? If not, you should be able to connect with one. That person should be a good source of information and resources that are available to you.

In general, someone cannot be undergoing treatment and also be receiving hospice care. Hospice is generally meant for people who have six months or less to live, according to their doctor. These are people who have either opted out of treatment or have run out of treatment options. What this means is that the patient will now be seen by a palliative care doctor, rather than the oncologist, they won’t receive any more treatment for the cancer, they will receive care focusing on their comfort and quality of life. A lot of this is pain management. They can receive home visits from the doctor and nurses, but it doesn’t mean home health care aid is covered. For the most part I don’t think it is but I’m not an expert for sure.

The thing you need the oncologist to be honest with you about is whether or not they think your mom‘s physical and mental condition are going to improve. Not about the cancer, but will she be able to walk on her own, will her cognitive skills recover? Is there anything that can be done to help her, physical therapy at home for example, to regain some of her strength? You need to understand what to expect. 

Your mom would probably be considered disabled so aside from what might be provided by hospice, as a disabled person she may be eligible for home care assistance under the insurance plan she has. Since it’s a state plan, the oncology social worker should be very familiar with what is offered. 

In terms of future treatment for the cancer, if her cancer has responded well to the treatment she’s had so far, it may be that she will get treatment in the future only if the cancer begins to progress.

I have made a new account to write this post, but I have been lurking for a while.

For the past few months, I (26M) and my sister (25F) have been taking care of my mother (59F), who was diagnosed with Stage 4A ovarian cancer in late 2020. In January 2021, we were able to get my mom to a top cancer center, where surgeons worked quickly to extend my mother's life--without them, she would've died long ago. After surgery and a difficult bout of chemo, she responded really well and there was little cancer detected in following scans. It looked like she would be cancer-free soon and could beat the odds.

In January 2022, my mother visited the cancer center's emergency room to inquire about worsening eyesight. A scan found that the cancer had spread to her brain. Her oncologist explained to us that the spread of ovarian cancer to the brain so quickly was rare, so they typically did not test for it so soon after the original diagnosis. In any event, my mother quickly underwent radiation therapy to treat the brain mets. Before this treatment, my mother was able to independently do much on her own--eat, bath, cook, walk, shop. She's gradually lost all of these abilities since the radiation therapy in February. Today, she is unable to walk without the assistance of at least two people (and only a few steps), is occasionally confused and had hallucinations (possibly from opioid medication as she still appears lucid 80 to 90 percent of the time), has considerable nausea, and barely eats any food. Even a transfer to the portable bathroom next to her bed is difficult and has occasionally required three people to successfully complete. It has become a 24/7 job for both of us and it is unsustainable for much longer, I feel.

According to our last meetings with her oncologists, the brain mets are improving and there is little sign of cancer continuing to spread in her body. However, we are unsure as to what the next treatment steps are for her. We have only been told that she may need further radiation or chemotherapy in the future, but we do not know when that will happen or how it will affect her body. This has made us feel like she could get better one day, but we are now really finding it challenging and overwhelming to take care of her. We really want to know how we can be helped in this situation and recently my sister and I have talked about hospice care, but are not sure what that entails exactly.

In many ways, I feel like I am failing my mom. She took care of us by herself after my father also died of cancer at only 38 (I was 5 so I have few memories of that time, but his death came quickly after diagnosis). My mom sacrificed everything to give me and my sister a great life full of opportunity, so I want to do right by her and repay all of her love. She has lived undocumented in California for 30 years, so our options are frequently limited (however, she has Medi-Cal \[Medicaid\] coverage thanks to California's laws, which has been a blessing for us). We have tried to move her into a nursing home at one point, but this was not covered.

I feel like if I was the one in this position, she would be doing everything she can to be with me.

I have some questions that I am hoping for some answers to:

1. In such a situation, does anyone know what our options are? If we were to go with hospice, does that mean she could not be treated any longer if she were to improve? Are there any other options besides hospice through which we could get at least some respite?
2. If the oncologists are correct about the brain mets shrinking and the little cancer left in her body, would it be too early for hospice?

My mother has an appointment with her oncologists tomorrow, so any guidance or words of wisdom from the people in this group would be incredibly amazing. Even to hear the experiences of people in similar situations would be very comforting, whether in the comments or by PM. Thank you so much."
ketogirlfromucf,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_usvtn7,4,i977duf,"As a therapist/counselor and someone that battled cancer myself I find it hard to believe that she asked you to cut your hair. That’s just  not professional. Are you sure she wasent just creating a safe space to discuss the possibility of what you would want to do if you lost your hair because part of her job might be to connect you with resources. Sometimes in therapy we make an open ended statement to initiate conversation about a difficult topic and allow you the ability to think/respond/consider options. As a side note, not everyone cuts their hair off, some let it fall out naturally, some wear a wig or head cover and some chemos don’t cause hair loss at all. Sometimes a therapist just doesn’t click with someone and maybe that’s what happened here too. Try to find one that you do click with if you can. 

If you’re considering not doing treatment I would strongly recommend a palliative care consult (that’s my personal specialty that I work in). In palliative care we sit down with people and talk through the diagnosis, treatment options, fears, hopes, goals, concerns and then help patients choose the path that is best for them at the time. Sometimes that path is not to pursue treatment and we help with symptom/pain management or connect them with hospice care, if eligible. Sometimes the path is to do treatment or a modified treatment plan and we can still help with pain/symptom management! It’s a really great service that works with your primary oncology team to support the patients goals.

You are under a lot of stress right now. I don’t know your medical history or if this is a new cancer diagnosis but take it one step at a time. Find someone you do trust to come to appointments with you because there can be a lot of information!! You don’t have to make decisions today, you have time to think and process the options.",t3_usvtn7,t1_i977duf,2022-05-19 13:29:41,/r/cancer/comments/usvtn7/what_do_i_even_do/i977duf/,r/cancer,what do I even do?,"So tomorrow I have my ptscan to determine how my cancer is and the next steps..

These types of problems can be caused by the cancer, a linked but separate illness such as infection, the treatment, or can be psychological.  Consider consultation with palliative care who can often help with uncontrolled symptoms.  

Look at the ECOG performance status.  This is often how we grade cancer related illness in a very general way.  It can let you ballpark how she is doing.  ECOG 1 is pretty standard.  ECOG 2 is a little worse but usually ok. ECOG &gt;2 is getting more worrisome.  

Let your doctors decide if she is appropriate for the clinical trial -- they are motivated to ""pick winners"" to some extent and you don't want to turn down potentially good therapy.

She's been fighting it since late 2020 when it was originally determined to be stage III. Since then she's had chemo, surgery, radiation, and two different types of hormone therapies, but unfortunately they haven't been able to stop the spread of her disease. She has progressively gotten worse since her diagnosis and in particular within these last few months. 

She recently started a clinical trail which we are hopeful will slow or stop her cancer. One of the requirement for the study is that the patient have more than six months of life expectancy. This is a big part of the reason I think I may just be paranoid. 

What I'm worried about is that my mom actually doesn't have much time left. Eating has been a struggle for her for the last few months, but lately it seems to have gotten worse. She has so much nausea. The thought of food makes her feel sick and Zofran doesn't seem to help her too much. But even if she is able to get past the nausea, she gets so full so quickly. I've been making her high calorie smoothies and she can't bring herself to finish them. She can also barely stomach Ensure anymore. Another thing making me worry is her increase in sleeping. She is tired all the time. She sleeps during the night time, but then ends ups falling asleep multiple times throughout the day which is something else that makes it hard to get food into her. On top of that she has a really hard time walking, has little interest in engaging in conversation or doing anything outside of laying in bed and watching television. She also has ascites that developed back in November of 2021, but has progressively gotten worse as time has gone on. All these things make me really worried that things aren't going well for her, but it doesn't seem that the doctors think the same. I just want to know if others think that I'm looking too much into things or there is something to genuinely be concerned about here. Her oncologist hasn't mentioned her prognosis or any concern that things may not be going well, so I just don't know. I have brought all these concerns up before, but I haven't brought them up in the context of being scared that time is running out for us. I too worry that I'll bring it up and the doctor will brush it off as no big deal and she'll continue to get worse. 

I apologize for the long post. This has been on my mind a lot lately and I don't know if I'm just catastrophizing or not. Thanks for reading all this and any input is appreciated."

I have just had a meeting with my oncologist to discuss the biopsy results of my colonoscopy. It is now truly confirmed to be exactly what they had informed me it was likely to be. However, they have also informed me that the genomic testing of the biopsy has revealed what sub set it is. Which sadly is quite an aggressive type. 

My initial time frame (given very roughly with no certainty) was around 4-5 years providing treatment is successful. Well, it has now been changed to 2 years maximum providing treatment goes perfectly. More like to be 12-18 months. 

Thanks for all the kind words and responses from everyone.

Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 32 yr old male that is reasonably fit, reasonably healthy, and have had absolutely no symptons before.

&amp;#x200B;

I have just had my diagnosis of Advanced Metastatic Colon Cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

It started low in my colon and has spread to a destructive lesion in my pubic bone, 8 growths in my liver, 3 on my left kidney and many many smaller growths in my lymph nodes.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of making this post is just to get it off my chest to people that have either experienced it, or have family members that have. Without being a damn Doctor, of which I have had far more than enough of in the last 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my story.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago I started getting pain in my left hip, I went to see my local GP who gave me anti inflammatories and asked me to report back in a week.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later it had gotten worse rather than improved, so he referred me over to get an xray and an ultrasound done of the area. They came back inconclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

The next step was an MRI of the area, which did happily reveal that the prognosis he had suggested was correct (a labral tear on the femur) however it also incidentally found a destructive lesion in the pubic bone.

&amp;#x200B;

This set off a whirlwind of blood tests and other test after a second opinion (my partner is an oncologist who forwarded the results to her consultant to get her opinion). The testing required was a full blood work up with cancer markers included as well as a full body CT scan.

&amp;#x200B;

The blood work came back as completely normal except for my CA 19-9 cancer marker, normal is less than 40, mine returned with a result of 1880.

&amp;#x200B;

The CT scan revealed multiple growth in different areas, confirming that it had spread and that I would need a PET scan to get more definitive answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I was then fast tracked through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre which is where my partner is currently working. They organised a PET scan to happen within a few days. I was also allowed to see the results about 10 minutes after the scan was concluded.

&amp;#x200B;

I was lit up like a christmas tree showing all the growths.

&amp;#x200B;

I have since spent 5 days in hospital in a pain crisis due to the lesion in my pubic bone having weakened the bone enough for it to fracture. (which just btw, seriously sucks) Whilst I was in the hospital they have also now done a Colonoscopy to get tissue samples of the Primary tumour in my colon.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently that is all I know, but the conversation with my oncologist have confirmed this to be a terminal case, and that systemic treatment is the only option, which will only allow a small extension of life.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate it all, my life was finally going in the right direction, I am successfully running a small business with one of my younger brothers. We are just about finishing our second full financial year and are expected to hit out first major milestone of 500k turnover.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also intending to ask my partner to marry me in a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

We were looking at houses to buy, and are working on our first child (she has reproductive issues, so we are pursuing IVF). Everything seemed to be going so well, I guess I can't be too surprised that the universe decided to slap me back down to reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's all I have to say right now, I just wanted to hear some other peoples opinions on everything, and to maybe get a little support in this ridiculous time of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers"

You have two options when it comes to statistics. Dive in, find the good numbers, the treatments that have people living 5, 7, 10 years after diagnosis, or stay away all together. Don’t go down the rabbit hole of looking at negative stats. Nothing is for certain.

Next, try and get your dad to go to a major cancer hospital if you have one nearby. Most trials and specialists willing to try out the newest most promising treatments are at these. Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, Moffit, John’s Hopkins, find one!

Celebrate the good news, but don’t get ahead of yourself. My dad had lots of ups and downs in his short battle. Just 2 months before he passed, he was told he was showing signs of early remission. The cancer was gone from his lungs! Unfortunately it had moved unnoticed into his spinal fluid, and that was it. This leads me to my next point, if something doesn’t seem right, say something and say it until it gets looked at! My dad was starting to sleep 20+ hours a day and when he was awake, he had headaches or wasn’t all there. The doctors did brain scans which were clear and said it was probably a side effect of treatment or something non-cancer related (he had developed AFIB shortly before diagnosis). By the time we made enough noise that they took it seriously and tested his spinal fluid, there was no hope for treatment. It was pain management and palliative care. 

Finally, spend as much time as you can with him. Ask him about his past. There are sites out there that give you leading questions to try and learn as much as possible. Write it down if you can. There are still times where I know my dad did something or would know the answer to which family member did that thing in 1985, but it’s lost now. Doing this isn’t giving up hope on recovery. He will die someday, hopefully not from cancer.

fishymcswims,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_vjhss7,8,idj9hi1,"Overall, I don’t think doctors should generalize patients as “keep them in the dark” or “overwhelm them with detail,” but instead approach each patient as a unique individual and offer them the opportunity to make informed decisions and participate in their own care as they see fit.

I have a unique perspective as both a cancer survivor and someone who’s worked in palliative care.  I’m the type of patient who wants to know more about my condition and care.  As a professional, I’ve also seen situations handled beautifully and respectfully, whether dictated by the individual or their cultural norms (or both) where a patient doesn’t want to know and allows their family members to talk with the doctors instead.  Law and ethics requires that patients be able to make informed decisions in their care, but what that means to each patient/situation can be different.

Life expectancy should only be offered in general terms (months to years…hours to days…) with the preface that no one knows for sure.  There are some generalizations for disease projected outlook and protective and risk factors that can alter that, but prognostication is not a science by any means.

There’s a lot of research and opinions that can go into this, but at the end of the day, I just want yo say that I’m sorry if you (or a loved one) are facing some tough news right now regarding life expectancy.

I'm a lurker to this sub, my mum also has metastatic breast cancer (57). I don't know where your head is at and what kind of person you are, but your post kinda struck a cord with me as I had a lot of similar questions. I wondered if this could be of benefit to you. I just read a book called ""With the End in Mind"" by Kathryn Mannix (palliative care doc). In a lot of chapters it talks about patterns of decline, and personally it's the first time I've come across something so explicit and informative. I had a lot of the same questions and struggled to get clear answers. I can understand why, it's difficult for anyone to say how long. What I liked about this book is reading anecdotes and getting an understanding of patterns. It was a hard read, I cried a lot.

In April we learned she had five brain mets. I have taken a leave of absence to be her caregiver. She can’t walk at all, is very weak, gets confused easily and sometimes forgets words. This past week she is suddenly sleeping a lot more-11-12hrs at night, 2hr morning nap, another nap in afternoon. The hospice doctor keeps acting like she probably doesn’t have long but it feels like such a slow decline, since this all started three months ago. Has anyone been in a similar boat? I keep asking myself does she have days, weeks, months? Her appetite is still good because she’s on dexamethasone but the increase in sleep seems to be signaling things are going more down hill.

A will allows you some control over your stuff after you pass away. Without a will, all your stuff goes to your next of kin. If that's not what you want, you need a will. If you want part of your assets to go to a non-profit, you need to do that while you're alive or through a will. If you have kids you can nominate who their guardian should be in a will. You may also create a standby guardianship created to name someone responsible for your kids if you can no longer do so. 

You should also have a healthcare power of attorney or advanced directives done so you can maintain some control over your healthcare even if you're incapacitated and can't communicate. There are also financial powers of attorney that can allow someone access to your assets and pay your bills in case you're not physically or mentally able to do so. 

I worked as an attorney for a non-profit law firm and helped people with these issues. Feel no shame if you don't have one by now. My brother, at the time of his diagnosis in his 40's, was an attorney, married, three kids, had a house, but no will. Dealing with your death is not something most of us want to do, but if you have many types of cancer you don't have much choice.

This came to mind after reading that the actor Chadwick Boseman had no will at the time of his death. His widow wants half of his assets to go to his parents. Generally, a surviving spouse would be entitled to the entire estate. I don't know if there was an earlier agreement or arrangement to this effect or just generosity on her part."

I won’t downvote you and I encourage others not to as well because you do have somewhat of a point. Currently I am on Portrazza. It’s a chemotherapy made for squamous non-small cell carcinoma both lung and/or skin. It’s the worst experience I’ve ever had and I’ve been through the ringer with many many medications. My treatments are done at home with a private nurse on the 1st and 8th of every month and then three weeks off. The biggest issue for me is what it does to my GI tract. I have multiple sclerosis as well which I’ve had since I was young and that already does a number on my GI tract. So I’m frequently vomiting and having a lot of trouble keeping food down. The only thing it hasn’t done is made my hair fall off which I am very very thankful for. 

So my days are filled with coughing up blood and in the fetal position in bed when the pain gets unbearable. I’m on palliative care for that but the pain still manages to break through. I’m really tired of narcotics even though I believe they are underutilized in chronic pain patients, which are the majority of patients I deal with. 

At my next appointment with my oncologist I plan to talk to him about a new novel non-chemo treatment I saw a commercial for that’s made for my cancer as well. It’s a mix of two DMDs, Opdivo and Vervoy that supposedly promises to eliminate the deleterious effects of traditional chemo drugs. I’m hopeful, I wouldn’t go as far as optimistic, but I’m hopeful. 

I hope this extra information serves to allay your worries about my initial post.

Been dealing with the highest treatable kind of testicular cancer the last...3.5 months.

Had port put in, ball taken out and 4 cycles of EP. My doc and I were ecstatic midway because my tumor shrunk by half!! 😀

Yay!!!!

Finished my last cycle first week of June. 

Got follow up CT, ultrasound and bloodwork.

It came back. My bloodwork got worse, and my tumor grew. It. Came. Back.

I'm sad and angry--because this is the situation I'm in and it sucks, even though I know it won't compare to many many of you. 

Have wonderful insurance. Been on short term disability with my employer since March. (I'm in the USA)

Out of FMLA hours, out of personal days, vacation time and sick leave. I was planning to go back to work, soon--but that's completely out of the picture. 

As soon as my STD ends and I'm not back--I'll be fired. That's just how my company rolls. 

I have to apply for long term disability--but that won't even cover my damned car payment and insurance much less food, rent, etc etc

Plus I'm a type 1 diabetic--and it won't cover the cost of any of my prescriptions and I'm on a ton. It won't even cover what I use for insulin in a month. 

I'm so screwed. My two options are: a different kind of chemotherapy (which I don't want to do because the damage I have from this initial set is horrid--I can't even pick up a pen without shaking, hearing loss, etc), and major surgery which will automatically put me out of work for 2 months--but it takes like 2 months to even schedule it. 

See my issue? I don't know what to do. I want to drive to my employer tomorrow and see if I can talk to HR and my supervisor together. They recommend me talking to the plant nurse but she is a completely mean and uncaring person who just wants to watch the world burn and she absolutely hates to even have to assist anyone.

I don't know what to do. 

I'm literally stuck in life. And I have no good options down the road. No other jobs in my entire state start at what I'm making or have the same or comparable plans (medical dental vision) that my company has. I've been there 18 years--even though seniority means absolutely nothing to them. 

And long term disability and COBRA insurance and Obamacare, and Medicaid and Medicare doesn't cover near what I need. BLECH. 

I'm just so sad and angry. 

The chemo works in like 99% of patients and I'm the 1%. 

I'm telling my oncologist that no matter what I'm going back to work--and I don't care what he says. I need the job to live...but can't work it through chemo, since chemo crippled me to the point of being bed bound for half the week and in the bathroom the other half. 

What do I do?

I don't even want to tell my family--because everyone, including me, expected it to be over.

mariodejaniero,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_vspdhv,3,if3o01m,"Cancer nurse here. First of all sorry about your mom. As for the meat of the question. There are 4 main ways of dealing with cancer. 

1) Radiation therapy (or radiotherapy)
2) Chemotherapy/immunotherapy
3) Surgery
4) Palliative/watchful waiting 

When you meet with the oncologist they will give you more details but essentially these can be done in any sort of order and combination. I wouldn’t call it good or bad news if she is doing chemo/radiation. Every cancer is different and some cancers are only susceptible to certain treatments. For lung cancer, chemo and radiation are very common. 

Chemotherapy is what most people think of as “cancer treatment.” It is a systemic therapy, very frequently given through an IV or mediport (basically a surgically implanted IV). It is made of chemicals that specifically target rapidly dividing cells - which is what a cancer is, just a cluster of cells that is dividing out of control. Unfortunately it affects all rapidly diving cells and can kill them too. Those rapidly diving cells are most common in your hair, fingernails, and GI tract - hence what most people think of when they think of chemo - hair loss, nausea, mouth sores, etc. there are many many many chemotherapeutic agents out there and they all have their own side effects so those are questions to be answered between your mom and her doctor. 

Radiation therapy is a very targeted therapy. It uses high frequency waves to kill cells. It is pretty easy to do, and it is just like getting an X-ray. Lay down on a table and let the machine do all the work. You don’t see it, hear it, feel it. In my experience, lung cancers are usually treated with high dose, short term radiation. So about a 30 minute treatment, every other day for about a week or two. This also depends on where the cancer is, if there are multiple modules, and what equipment is available at your local cancer center. It’s not uncommon to also expect a slightly longer course of daily radiation for about 4-6 weeks. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to comment or DM me and I will be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability but also know I legally can’t give out medical advice. I am just here to educate and support.

As an oncology pharmacist there aren’t a lot of medical situations I can think of that you would be required to go to hospice for pain management unless your body isn’t tolerating the options you have. Or if your body isn’t tolerating dialysis because of the amount or type of pain meds you need. 

In regards to the Lasix, if you have been on dialysis for 12 years and have not produced urine for 12 years, that means your kidneys are damaged enough that not only will Lasix likely not work, it likely won’t cause any more damage than is already there. So let the nurse and doctor be proven wrong about it and don’t worry yourself about it.

This is a super important point. Palliative care includes so much more than just hospice. Palliative care is meant to palliate suffering from any terminal disease, even if you won’t die from the disease for many many many years (or never in many cases).

Palliative care providers, especially those associated with cancer centers, are far more experienced with treating cancer related pain, nausea, neuropathy, depression, etc. 

However if they’re telling you the reason you have to go to hospice is because you need IV pain meds, then it’s probably true. 

Still, if palliative care medicine consults are available to you it will be valuable to use it even just to help your transition.

His blood tests are fine and don't see any CEA cancer markers and his CT scan shows no growths or tumours growing anywhere. 

Both the gastro surgeon and the oncologist gave 2 options :
1. Wait it out and do regular screenings. Colonoscopies and CT scans. 
2. Do a colon resection to remove a small 5-10cm region around the ex polyp site. To remove all doubts and can further be staged .

I rarely have encounter a hospice care facility that also manages/coordinates palliative services, and state funded programs that Medicaid/Medicare patients qualify for on top of what’s paid for by commercial insurance as well. A social worker does that part. Things like respite is sometimes covered by insurance, but emotional support without the medical care, companionship. Those things are not. in-home haircuts, home based grief counseling, cooking meals, cleaning, grocery shopping, a lot of things the family/caregivers struggle with when they’ve committed all of their energy to 24hour medical care; yet still need to be addressed somehow. Those things can’t be arranged by the nurse. We can only do vitals, process notes, med adjustments and ordering more rxs and DME for delivery. Patient education, arranging for a lpn or cna to do basic personal hygiene, etc., Beyond that we’re limited. Most of that comes out of patients pockets; but it’s not necessary if you have the support of a palliative team with a social worker on board and those things typically aren’t apart of hospice services- from my experience.

A fall with a break that wasn’t a result of negligence or related to the cancer itself, or pneumonia that requires more than just oral antibiotics, anticholinergics and oxygen supplementation, for example. In those cases, where the patient is on hospice, skilled facilities with 24hour nursing staff is available is a covered option- when it’s a temporary concern &amp; the family can’t manage on their own. As long as it’s not while they’re in the active dying process, this is pretty standard practice. Home Hospice doesn’t mean you’re committed to suffering along the way when it’s an easily addressed concern. The only thing I’ve encountered with difficulty having it paid on is ambulance services for hospice patients. that isn’t covered unless it’s pre-auth’ed for anyone on home based care. As I said before, hospice, palliative care, or both can be covered depending on your insurance, and what your facility provides. In some places the only option is one or the other but in others they provide both. It’s not often that I’ve run into all of it covered by one service yet needing the support from more than one isn’t uncommon. The hospice nurse can’t provide much beyond the basics; vitals &amp; progress monitoring, DME &amp; Meds, patient education. however non-essential things that are related to quality of life is a palliative service usually taken on by social workers to arrange. Social workers in a hospice program is not common. Palliative care services or through the state for Medicare/Medicaid patients is an option for this. 

Medicare guidelines- is more of a minimum standard of care. Just as with contracted fee schedules, they pay for/allow much less than commercial insurance does. If Medicare guidelines for standards of care were imposed in these situations, the number of visits the hospice nurse could make to a patients home would be limited. As would the drug doses/quantities. Same for paying out of pocket; if Medicaid/Medicare denies coverage- it’s as good as denied access to a service. OOP isn’t an option.

Your mom knows she's going to die sooner than later, and it sounds like she's doing what's most important to her -- spending time with loved ones in the up close/personal/intimate way that she wants. 

As a two-time cancer and chemo survivor, I can tell you that a lot of times people put themselves through some terrible treatments to make loved ones happy, not because that's what they want for themselves. And doctors go along with it because they don't want to get involved with messy family dynamics. Sometimes patients in this position really resent their loved ones for forcing them into awful treatments, but don't know how to say it, or feel that they can't say anything since their loved ones just want them to live longer. Maybe some of this is going on, and if so it's coming out with angry accusations about the stress you're causing her. 

This is really hard to say so I know it must be terrible to hear, but have you considered that she may want to go more quickly?  I suggest having an honest but calm discussion with her about her wishes and how she wants to spend the remaining time left.

The results came in today and the doctor's reactions wasn't very good. An initial appointment for surgery has been turned into immediate chemotherapy on the earliest date available. We never suspected anything till now as he's one of the most healthiest people we know in our family. 

The only details the doctor has given so far is that it's Sarcoma, supposedly the worst form of cancer out of all. And that it's in stage 4 indicated by the spread of it from its point of origin from pelvis region to lungs as well as bones. It's pretty evident from the antics of doctors and other technicians over there that they're hiding quite some facts. 

So please be honest with me. What are his chances of survival? Will the chemotherapy just keep controlling the spread or will it actually help him recover completely? Should we avoid these treatments that will completely cripple him or let him live and go back to his normal life and wait for his time?"

Went to Sloan Kettering, received a hepatic pump, plus surgery to remove the Mets. I won’t say it’s been easy. I’ve had probably a dozen surgeries, over 40 treatments, sepsis several times and the cancer has spread to numerous organs. The good news is that I am currently only being monitored with scans every 8 weeks and hopefully I’ll have good news again. Only 1 surgery so far this year and praying it’s my last. It’s a rough journey but I am too young to give up. I have young children and willing to anything to stay in their lives. Make sure you have a great team in place, including a palliative care team, which some people mistake for hospice care. Still  do all of your favorite things, don’t let cancer define you.

She's been in the ICU for 6 days. Every day getting weaker. She's not going to get better. She is so weak that chemotherapy will likely kill her and there are no alternative treatments. My mom has been given the option to stay hooked up to her machines and continue like this until she eventually passes or she can be taken off and given very high doses of pain medication. The doctor said she would last a couple hours at most once taken off the machines. This is not something she's had a lot of time to think about because we didn't even know she had cancer until about 4 days ago. I know there might not be a great answer for this question, but.. is there anything I can say to her to make her less scared of dying? The hardest part through this whole thing for me is knowing how scared she is and not knowing how to help her.

My doctors tell it how it is. I was told on the day they diagnosed me that they don't talk about a cure for my type of cancer. Their goal is to give me as much high-quality time as they possibly can. Beat the cancer back. Keep it so it doesn't disrupt my life too much. All of the decisions about my care are up to me. They will give me the options, I make the choices. If I want to stop treatment and ho for palliative care only where I'm drugged oug of my brain, I can. My choice.

If I want to take the painful and risky treatments - as long as there's a chance it could help then I can choose that.

My family is hiding a lot of things from me, they always smile and act like it's all okay and good but my cousin told me she overheard them saying it's palliative and they wont live for long.

For more infos, he has stage 4 NSCLC with bone mets on the hips and Sydrome of. Bourgeot-Sjören as a secondary effect that paralysed his face to some extent.

I have a lot of question and what they're saying on the internet isnt helpful to me and I dont know what to believe anymore. I dont know if I have to have hope or not and the bomb my cousin dropped on me is way too big.

Anyway, some of my questions are can Iressa actually make the cancer shrink ? Is it only palliative ? And is it the only drug used against EGFR positive and why would they choose this specific drug if there are other ones ?

ive been dealing with the new back pain since may maybe? i dont remember. i was doing very good for so many months where i didnt need like, any daily med to get me through the day. and then suddenly it changed and my back hurts...and now im terrified of asking my doctors for help. i dont think my pain has to do with my cancer. not directly at least. i had a bone scan done yesterday to rule anything out and im sure its gonna come back as nothing, so im trying to prepare myself for the doctor calls ill get when they realize that. 

but like, what do i do? my back hurts...but if its not cancer related, do i deserve to have the pain relieved at all? but then a part of me thinks...maybe my back hurts because the cancer has made me less active and that made my back more prone to being hurt. so in a way...indirectly...it COULD be cancer related. but even thinking like it that way is making me feel guilty too. like, am i just so lazy because of the cancer that its hurting my back?? am i using cancer as an excuse to be lazy and the result is a painful back? i feel horribly guilty about that.

my care team has been trying to figure out why my back hurts all week and im stressed out. i hate answering ""no"" to all their questions. i hate the long pauses they take when they dont know what to say next because to them it sounds like the pain either isnt real or is coming from nowhere. it sucks. i hate feeling like im crazy because of back pain.

the same thing happened before i was diagnosed. my first symptom in feburary 2020 was back pain. we didnt fix that until december of 2021. this new back pain feels the same, just in a different spot, thus why my doctors are so confused. before, the reason was a tumor in my spine, but my most recent scan in may showed nothing else in my spine that could be causing the pain, so am i just going crazy? i dont know. its frustrating. i wish i could relieve the pain with tylenol, do it on my own and avoid all the questions from my doctors, but even 4x extra strength wasnt doing anything and &gt;!i was low-key overdosing on the tylenol !&lt;for a couple weeks, which only made things harder for me and my poor cancer ridden liver. its better for me to be on prescribed pain meds, but that doesnt stop me from feeling immensely guilty over the whole thing. 

idk. i suppose i just wanted to vent to people who might relate or who might have some words of advice or care. ive been going through this for 2 years now but i have been living for 26 years before that absolutely terrified of asking for help. its hard changing how my brain is hardwired, its hard accepting that i need help and i need to ask for it and that i DESERVE to be helped. i wish i could do it on my own, silently, quietly, and get better before anyone even knew there was anything wrong with me to begin with. its hard needing to rely on others.

Reagan__Turedi,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wb2vjv,9,ii4qkmx,"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lungs is small cell lung cancer. There are two stages to this cancer, instead of the traditional four.

* Limited and Extensive.

Limited means that the cancer is limited to one side of the chest (lymph nodes included), and can be treated with a single radiation field.

Extensive means that the cancer has spread extensively through the lung(s) or outside of the lungs to a distant organ.

The standard of treatment depends on the stage, but is primarily treated with a platinum doublet chemotherapy consisting of Cisplatin or Carboplatin and Etoposide. Somewhat recent studies have suggested, and approved the addition of the immune therapy ""Tecentriq"" to chemotherapy (typically for extensive stage disease). So, the first line of treatment may be any of the following:

* Cisplatin + Etoposide + Tecentriq
*  Carboplatin + Etoposide + Tecentriq

Cisplatin is typically given in a curative setting. It has similar, but marginally better, efficacy compared to Carboplatin, but tends to produce more side effects and be harder on the kidneys.

Carboplatin is typically given in a palliative setting. This chemotherapy will generally have less side effects, but has a harsher effect on blood counts compared to Cisplatin.

Tecentriq can be given in the case of extensive stage disease, as this is what it is approved for, but many patients (including my father who had small cell cancer of the pancreas), with a ""limited stage"" disease can get approval for Tecentriq.

Surgery is not typically recommended as a first line of treatment since this cancer is typically very quick to metastasize. It is often assumed that by the time a diagnosis of SCLC is made, there is microscopic growth elsewhere in the body, and a large presence of circulating tumor cells. If the stage is limited, there may be a role for surgery following a response to chemotherapy.

A few caveats I will mention are the following, as I believe that some oncologists not entirely being truthful about the reality of this diagnosis creates a worse outcome overall:

* This cancer is aggressive, and the survival rate of this cancer is not great.
* This cancer is known to respond remarkably well to chemotherapy initially, but it tends to relapse very quickly with relatively resistant disease.If the goal of treatment is to cure the cancer, you have to throw everything you have at this cancer in the first-line setting. Once this cancer relapses, it is very hard to get it to respond to another line of treatment.

**You will need to do the following:**

1. Request a copy of the pathology report, and make a note of the Ki-67%. This is a value of how fast the cancer is growing. The higher the Ki-67, the faster it is growing. This will become crucial for treatment decisions later on should the cancer progress (i.e. do you have time to ""wait"" and see if immune therapy will work \[takes 4-8 weeks\], or should you switch to a second line chemotherapy?).
2. Request an additional biopsy if needed to get a Next-Generation Sequencing analysis performed. This type of test identifies the precise genetics &amp; mutations of the cancer, and might identify targetable mutations. Even if there are no targetable mutations, sometimes the report will show which sub-variant of SCLC this is. (Does is have typical TP53/RB1 mutations? Does it harbor additional mutations that indicate a trial of another drug is worthwhile?, etc)
3. Sometimes the pathology can be wrong. Small biopsies, limited samples, or improper use of tools during the biopsy can result in things like a ""crush(ing) artifact"" which can simulate small cell carcinoma, despite the pathology being something completely different. If there is suspicion of this cancer being misdiagnosed (no response to cisplatin/etoposide, very slow growth, normal tumor markers for SCLC, very faint neuroendocrine markers on IHC,etc.) I would request another biopsy. ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21632632/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21632632/))
4. You should request that with each blood work a test to measure both LDH and NSE is performed. Typically NSE is more likely to be a viable tumor marker, but LDH is also sometimes elevated in the case of small cell lung cancer. These will allow you and your doctor to get a sense of treatment response well before your scans.

&amp;#x200B;

Most oncologists attempt to explain the goals of treatment using a variety of different terms, analogies, metaphors, etc. I find that these are often not useful and confusing to patients. I will explain this in very simple terms so that you don't have to rattle your brain trying to figure out what the doctor is saying, or ""read between the lines"" of what your doctor is saying.

**If a cure is the goal of treatment, then quality of life during treatment matters less. A curative treatment for SCLC is a three step plan.**

* **Systemic control, local control, removal.**

Systemic control is chemotherapy. You need to ensure that the microscopic spread is eliminated, and new tumors do not pop up elsewhere in the body. You will first control the cancer on a systemic level.

Once you have achieved systemic control (your first scan shows that the cancer is shrinking, and no new tumors have appeared), you will continue doing systemic control, but add in local control of the cancer. This is typically in the form of radiation. You will irradiate the living hell out of the tumor. Ask your radiation oncologist to be especially aggressive, and if denied, find one that will. MRI guided SBRT is a form of radiation therapy that allows for extremely high doses of radiation to be delivered to a very precise location. You can find a center that offers this here ([https://viewray.com/find-mridian-mri-guided-radiation-therapy/](https://viewray.com/find-mridian-mri-guided-radiation-therapy/))

Once you have gained both systemic and local control (your followup scan after the radiation shows continued shrinkage of the cancer, and no new tumors pop up) you can elect to do surgery. This will remove any residual cancer.

Following this is a period of ""watch and wait"" where you wait to see if the cancer is gone. This cancer is quick to return if cells are left, so this period will be brief. My non-doctor opinion is more chemo/immune therapy post surgery should you be able to tolerate it, but I know most oncologists will disagree. Find one that agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

**If the goal of the treatment is purely palliative, then the treatment is a multi-step plan to prolong your life + ensure quality of life.**

You will have chemotherapy with/without immune therapy, or immune therapy with/without chemotherapy until treatment failure. In the event of treatment failure, you will continue to switch to different therapies. In the event of a targetable mutation, this may mean a targeted therapy or clinical trial. You may receive palliative radiation/palliative surgery to eliminate tumor mass from problem areas. An example of this is spinal radiation to alleviate the pain caused from bone metastasis. 

Just because you are on a palliative treatment plan does not mean life comes to an end soon. There are plenty of patients who have outstanding and remarkable responses to a single therapy that keeps them alive for years past their prognosis. There are new treatments coming out every single day, and what we have now may be 1/10th as effective as what we will have a year from now.

I will end this with a mention of my father. He was diagnosed in February 2021 with multifocal small cell carcinoma of the pancreas. He had two massive tumors in his abdomen stemming from both the pancreatic head, and pancreatic tail (14cm and 8cm). His abdominal lymph nodes were also aggressively infected with cancer. His anticipated survival was anywhere from 6-8 months. He experienced progression of disease following chemotherapy in June 2021, and during that time some of his doctors recommended that further treatments would not have the effect we were hoping for. We were told that the reality was that this cancer would decide his fate, and that aggressive treatments would do more harm than good.

We were lucky enough to have oncologists that agreed to our plans of extremely aggressive treatments, because as of today my father has had no evidence of cancer since November 2021, which is 8.5 months.

Been referred to hospice. But currently not all that sick, just waiting for the other boot to fall.","****Please don't read this if you don't need a bummer story from someone who is almost definitely not going to defeat cancer****

Well let me try to keep it short.

I was diagnosed in the summer 2020 with Lymphoma: at first I was told it was some kind of indolent variety that would require lifetime maintenance, but I could live with for decades.  Not much later this diagnosis was changed diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which is aggressive but also curable. It had created large abdominal masses that would eventually cause organ failure etc if left alone.

My first round in this fight were a loss for me; RCHOP and more severe chemos were not keeping the cancer down, and would not lead to remission.

Halfway through this fight my oncologist started transitioning me to a new plan; we'd beat the cancer down as best we could and I would start in a CAR T cell immunology treatment study.

At the end of the year I began CAR-T cell treatment.  I immediately experienced severe side-effects (cytokine release syndrome) and went to the hospital  where I suffered a spinal stroke that left me paraplegic.  I now had to deal with this new disability while waiting to see if the cancer had been treated successfully.

It had!  I showed remission, eventually went home in Feb 2021 to train myself how to walk again, cope with being paraplegic, etc.

Lucky me, I have an awesome wife and family to support me!  I can't imagine going through all that alone.

Fast forward to Feb 2022.  A new tumor was discovered in my pelvis.  It caused pain there and in my left leg, and eventually made that leg weak again to the point where I lost my nacient to walk with a walker, etc.

This time around I was dealing with weak blood counts; I would go neutropenic, needed red bc transfusions, had poor platelets, etc. This disqualified me from a lot of experimental treatments.

But we went ahead and did our best.  First I got radiation to try to postpone the aggressive tumor growth, and it worked well with minimal side effects.

Next I tried an experimental chemo option, which simply did not work well enough.

From here we tried another study drug plus chemo,  which also didn't keep up with the tumor.  Actually I wasn't able to do more than one full round of this chemo due to poor blood counts (mainly platelets).

Currently I don't qualify based on various factors for other drug trials or treatments.  They don't want to try CAR T a second time since the first one almost killed me, left me disabled.  I'm on a maintenance chemo of sorts (recently had second round) that's less effective as I go.

My team has already referred me to hospice, or will soon- according to them it's better to set this stuff up now while I'm still able to think straight.  Things could start to go down hill in a week or two, or maybe much longer- who really knows??

So unless my platelets somehow miraculously recover, and I qualify for some kind of miracle study treatment that actually works this time, I looking at end of life here.  I wish I knew how to feel about this; I've never despaired throughout the whole ordeal- no idea why.  But that may change soon.

Anyway that is all, thank you for reading this shit story, and please forgive me if it has a negative effect on you.  I did try to warn you!  I just felt the need to share this garbage."
ketogirlfromucf,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wflegm,6,iiwwc95,"Do you have health insurance? What is your out of pocket max? I remember when I started chemo last year I was overwhelmed by the cost of treatment but quickly realized with my insurance I had to absorb most of the upfront cost and quickly met my out of pocket max. This year I literally met my $8,000 out of pocket max from one round of chemo and some radiation in the first 2 months. The rest of the year including my huge surgery and oral medications are “free”. Your social worker in clinic can help you sit down to review your insurance documents if they are overwhelming for you. Financial assistance is limited at best for organizations paying for someone’s treatments but you could try fundraising in your community or looking into some small grants. It sounds like your cancer might be metastatic at this point (in more than one organ) so I would also ask your doctor about the goals of treatment (curative vs life prolonging/palliative) at this point and what they anticipate treatment to look like long term. If you’re in the US have you applied for Medicaid or maybe your hospital has an income based assistance program. You could also switch to a hospital that does offer an assistance program.

ETA: just saw you’re 13. You don’t need to worry about all these details. Talk to your parents. It likely is not actually $13,000 - that is probably the cost before insurance.

pavlovunkedisi,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wl7ih0,1,ijson8p,"Cure is achieved when all cancerous cells are eliminated from the body. For e.g., if there is cancer only in your lung, then surgery is done with curative intent, so that, by removing the  cancerous tumor, hopefully all the cancerous cells are removed from the body. Unfortunately curative intent doesn't always mean that a cure is achieved since there can be circulating cancer cells in the body even after a treatment is performed with curative intent. Such remaining cancer cells can cause recurrence, either in the same location or in a distant part of the body. If the cancer has metastasized, then it's very often not curable: so treatment is  performed with palliative intent, i.e., with the intent to prolong and optimize patient's life. So palliative treatment is different from hospice care (end of life care), and a person with cancer could live long with palliative treatment where cancer is handled like a chronic illness (of course how long depends on the type and aggresiveness of the cancer).

For e.g., in my case, I was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 2. I had a surgery with curative intent. I had clear resection margins and clean lymph nodes. My doctors thought I should be cured. I even received chemotherapy after the surgery to decrease the possibility of recurrence in case there were remaining cancer cells in my body.

My oncologists told me that the chemoradiation would be given with “curative intent.“ At the time, I didn’t believe a word of it, thought that the treatment wouldn’t work and that I would be dead within two to three years.

However, the treatment seems to have worked really well. (Yay!) Since the end of treatment, I have had 9 follow-up scans and have all been clear with no evidence of malignancy.

So now I get to wonder about things I didn’t even think to wonder about three years ago, namely what does it really mean to be “cured.“ Up until now, I had just assumed that that merely meant I had chance of getting to 5 years without a recurrence, but that the cancer would almost certainly return after that.

So, I suppose my question is this: When my oncologists say that they are treating someone with “curative intent,” does this mean:

a) We think you have a chance of getting to five years without a recurrence, at which time you will be officially cured. Of course, the cancer will probably come back eventually at some point (10, 15, 20 years from now), but that will “count” as a new cancer. (Of course, what do I care what they call the cancer a new cancer or not, if my treatment options will be the same).

OR

b) We think it is not only possible that you will not only reach 5 years without a recurrence, but that it is also possible that you will live for decades without a recurrence and die from another cause?

In other words, do they mean a possible “cure,” or a possible ***cure*** ?"

Any advice is appreciated.,"Hi r/cancer 

I thought it would be good to write down my thoughts. Any advice or words of support are greatly appreciated.

I am curently sitting in an empty ER waiting area, (unheard of at this time of night.) waiting for my mom to get unloaded from the  ambulance and get in a room. My mom was diagnosed with  stage three Ovarian Cancer 3 years ago. Since then she had beat it with Chemo, but it is back and worse then ever, and non of the Chemos work anymore. 

My mom most tough person I know. She would never whine or complain about anything. She is loved by everyone in her church, among our freinds, and anyone in the neighborhood. I know I am lucky to have her as my mom.

Recently we have put her through chemo, Immuno therapy, dozens of doctors and specialists, and every treatment. Recently, he has been in pain. So, so much pain, and there doenst seem to be anything we can do. We are  immigrants, and even though we have been in the U.S. for over 20 years our paperwork is still in limbo. My sister got married, but until everthing is done, my mom is inbetween Visa’s and cant get any kind of insurence, goverment assistence or even a ID to make checking into the ER easier. So its not uncommon us to wait weeks for a doctor apointment, only to be kicked out of the office without reason. Dispite us making out situation clear from begining, saying that we are paying cash.

Now we are here, I forced my dad to stay home (so he could at least try to get some sleep.) and I’m waiting here a 3 a.m. for the hospital staff to finally tell me i can go in and hold my mom’s hand while they pump even  more pain meds in her to make her life even a little bit bearable. I have lost count of how many time this has happened, nothing the doctors gives us seem to work and we cant go to pain managment because, again, she cant get a state ID. So she lives in constent fear of the pain returning.

I hope this gets better soon. i dont know how much longer she can hang on like this. I dont know know what we are going to do when we run out of options. We have an incredible support network and thank God everyday for it. 

The new goal is trying to get her into Mayo Clinic, we first need to get Financial aid because we heard they would keep you if you dont have insurence. But we have also heard several out friends, some with the same type if cancer, get healed from them when every other hospital and doctor already gave up. If anyone know a trick to get in, something to put on the forms that could help, please share with me. 
 
Thanks for reading"
EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wnvc54,2,ikazawe,"Call the doctor tomorrow. This is not OK. Tell your doctor the concerns exactly the way you’ve told them to us. One thing about being a caregiver is that you can’t be afraid to pick up the phone and call the doctor when you have concerns. That is the number one thing to learn when you are either a caregiver or a cancer patient.mAnd if you don’t like what they tell you or it doesn’t make sense, you need to press the issue. You don’t have to be mean about it but you have to be assertive.

You should be able to get your mom a consult with a nutritionist, someone who can help find some foods she can eat, who can keep tabs on her food intake and her hydration and give you advice on how to deal with both. A palliative care doctor can also be helpful when somebody is suffering from chemo side effects like this. That doctor can access quality of life and determine if your mother is depressed or if she’s just reacting normally to being very sick and having toxic chemicals in her body.

Some oncologists are good about also assessing a patient’s quality of life. And some just focus on whether or not treatment is working and don’t care so much about quality of life. You got a figure out which type of oncologist your mom has. If the doctor doesn’t respond well to your concerns, that is the time to get a palliative care doctor involved who only focuses on quality of life.

And your mom hasn’t given up. That phrase should never be applied to anybody who is sick. She has an extremely difficult cancer and she’s had toxins pumped into her body.

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wokl59,15,ikbsumx,"I can’t tell you what I would do in that situation. Do your doctors have an idea of how long you have if you don’t do any more treatment? Regarding your wife, what are her thoughts? Have you had a frank discussion with her about this? I don’t think she would want you to stop treatment so that she could begin getting on with a new life. I’m guessing she would want you to stop treatment only if it was the right thing for you, not to spare her something that you think you would be sparing her.

Have you tried any drugs for depression?  The fact that you’re suffering right now it is primarily mental and that you feel you can handle the physical part of your situation, that tells me more could be done. I’m on antidepressants I was on them before I was diagnosed with metastatic cancer and for some people they can be very helpful. I think it’s worth looking into.

If you can have a meeting with a palliative care doctor, that could help. This is one of the things they can do, is to talk through these issues and do it with and I both towards quality of life and the medical realities. My experience has been that doctors who choose to be palliative care doctors are doctors who are empathetic and who can have these really tough discussions that an oncologist may not be capable of. If you didn’t do more treatment, I would think you’d want to understand more about how much time you could expect and what quality of life you could expect during that time.

overwhelmedmum,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wokl59,1,ikfszf1,"Hello willmeeling! I don’t really know what to say other than I get it.

I am 34F with 3 kids (10m, 8m, &amp; 3f). I was first diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2019 (right after my baby turned a year old). I did oral chemo and 36 sessions of radiation (found out mass was cancerous after majority of it was removed). Everything seemed ok. In January of 2021, a routine scan informed us that the cancer spread to my left lung and about half was already whited out. Started iv chemo and did that for about 5-6 months but was stopped by my doctor because the side effects were too severe for me. Ended up getting prescribed Lonsurf. Eventually that stopped working and by the end of 2021, we found out that it spread to my bones now. In the beginning of this year, I ended up changing my oncologist because I felt like he was giving up on me. Then again, I never really felt like he was #teamme. The nurses were amazing and helped me a lot but I just couldn’t continue with this doctor. He had no problem throughout my time with him, reminding me of my estimated life expectancy. Initially it was 3-5years with treatment. Then as it spread, 2-3 years. This year, he said that I should focus on palliative care and hospice because the new meds he put me on, stivarga, might not work and going back on iv chemo is kind of moot at this point.

This new doctor is pretty straightforward, blunt, compassionate, and really shows he cares. I’m back on iv chemo and I’m on every 2 weeks. I do about 5-6hours in the clinic and then get placed on a to-go pump that runs for 48hours. I hate it. I hate the vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss (something I’ve struggled with and should be a pro 😅 not a con), loss of energy, depression and increased anxiety. Let’s not forget the pain I’m constantly in. I’ve tried so many different pain meds and none helped/worked. Percocet was working until it stopped. Now, I’m on methadone and it helps take the edge off the pain but I still feel it. It never goes away. I use a walker to help me when walking for stability because it started attacking my right thigh bone (received radiation). I’d use a wheel chair at my appointments but after I got radiation and the pain wasn’t so bad, I ditched the wheelchair (have one at home just in case) and forced myself to walk. It’s challenging but I’m trying to fight this. 

I try not to think about dying and all that because I’m not ready. My kids are still so young and I want to experience their birthdays, be there when they go through puberty, first bf/gf, graduations, first jobs, marriage, starting a family &amp; pretty much all of life’s milestones. I’m stage IV and don’t know how much time I have left. I’m trying to make the most of my time now but it’s so difficult. I can’t be outside during the day because my skin is so sensitive to the sun/heat. I have difficulty breathing because my left lung is collapsed. There’s just too many negatives. I try to be positive but it’s like as soon as I start to feel like a person, I’m quickly reminded to pump my brakes and face reality.

I’ve had thoughts of just being done but I just break down and beat myself up for thinking that. I can’t give up. I don’t know what to do majority of the time. I just know that I want to be around much longer than I’m scared to admit what I think I have left (does that make sense). I get how you are feeling and how we think it’s better to be over with this so our love ones aren’t burdened anymore. They don’t deserve it. They deserve better. I’ve been told this many times that no matter what, they will be here. Because they love me. You are completely loved. People don’t stick by you during difficult times for nothing. They want to be whatever you need them to be. They want to hold your hand throughout this scary, difficult and dark time. I think it’s great that you’re seeing someone to help with the thoughts you’ve been having. Do you talk to your wife? About these feelings? 

I’m very stubborn and find it hard to believe sometimes that I deserve all this love but I know deep down it’s genuine love. That’s what makes this so much harder. We can’t give up. We’ve got to keep fighting even when we think we can’t much longer. A little longer . Just a little longer. ❤️",t3_wokl59,t1_ikfszf1,2022-08-15 21:47:20,/r/cancer/comments/wokl59/i_want_to_stop_chemotherapy/ikfszf1/,r/cancer,I want to stop chemotherapy,"Just a quick history, first; I am 45 and I was diagnosed with colon cancer 3 years ago.

There are groups within NA for people who have to take pain medicine due to their physical conditions. If he does become addicted which, I understand is very likely, that’s a bridge you cross when you get there.

While he was in the  hospital, we asked everyone who came in the room about pain relief, but the only thing they offered was percoset. (Advil is a no go, because he'd taken too much at home and they were qorried about stomach damage.) Due to previous addiction issues, he didn't want to use opiates,amd when we asked for other options, they just shrugged. 

Now that he's out of the hospital bed and has to move around to go to appointments, the pain Is much much worse. He gave in and went to a random doctor near us for a percoset prescription, but we keep asking everyone we talk to at his cancer appointments for other options. All they'll say is that we'll meet with the pain management team on Thursday, and that we're lucky to have been able to get an appointment that soon. (At that point, it will have been two weeks since he was admitted to the hospital and over a week since he was released.)

Is this normal? I'm absolutely furious. Without the percoset, the pain is absolutely disabling, but, again, he has had addiction issues.

I don’t know anything about the American system, but here in Canada, when I had a pain episode that was uncontrollable, I was able to go through my local hospitals cancer clinic to get revered to the palliative care ward in a neighbouring community. I was admitted for some time as they gave me a ketamine pump that could not be used at home, and injectable dialaudid (hydromorphone). Once my pain was stable, I was given the choice whether to remain in care for Christmas, or go home to my family. On discharge I was set up with a home nurse 3x a week and a prescription for above said injectables minus the ketamine (though the way it works with dilaudud is a god send). Unfortunately I kept blowing my line, so I was taught to install my own injection site. Luckily for me, I beat that round and eventually had to taper off the injectables. I was prescribed oral dilaudid and tapered down.

FolFiri is a type of chemo mix. They abbreviate the drug names of the cocktail they give you. Surgery to remove any of my tumours was never an option so I never had that conversation with my treating team but there was a push to start chemo straight away.

I struggled a lot with chemo recovery with the first 2 rounds of chemo (4x2 cycles so 8 in total). I was going in for treatment every 2 weeks. My oncologist said she only gives 5% of her patients as strong a dosing as she did initially. She went hard due to my age and that I was physically fit. Since then, because I have lost that condition, the dose has been reduced so the recovery has been a lot easier.

My palliative doctor has been incredible at managing my symptoms (pain, bowel issues, sleep, anxiety) and making sure I am as well as possible. The negative being because of all the opioids I’m on, I am unable to drive anymore. Chemo fog is probably my most challenging symptom because nothing can be done. I have also got severe neuropathy which means I have lost some dexterity in my hands which slows me down with simple tasks like getting ready in the morning.

Initially i was advised that a low residue diet would be best for me. I ended up dropping 10kg within a month which I think was primarily muscle wastage. I really struggled with eating at all because of severe diarrhoea which now turns out was due to a bowel obstruction. Since my emergency colostomy, eating has been a lot easier. I just have some food aversions due from the chemo.",t3_wqe1tg,t1_ikne3k1,2022-08-17 12:44:19,/r/cancer/comments/wqe1tg/33_stage_4_colorectal_cancer_feeling_empty_inside/ikne3k1/,r/cancer,,

We're lucky in that we live in the SF bay area so we have some national cancer center options. I talked to one of the top lung cancer doctors at UCSF already and he thinks palliative / systemic medicine the only option given that my mom has peritoneal carcinomatosis (very rare for lung cancer). UC Davis is still cautiously waiting to see how the system treatment (EGFR target therapy - osimertinib, it's an easy one compared to your panitumumab experience) goes before making any recommendations so I still have hope for that one.

Where was he supposed to get the chemo? NYU? Is the main problem that he’s too sick to go to his chemo appointments? Like once he’s feeling better, he can attend those appointments? 

There is a chance that they will admit him for symptom control, but once that is over they will discharge him. These symptoms are also common with stage 4 colon cancer, so they might just be trying to get his pain meds figured out. He needs fentanyl patches.

They can’t give antidiarrheal because he can have an obstruction.  It sounds like the next step they take is going to be a feeding tube so that he doesn’t have to swallow anything, along with IV nutrition. With stage 4 Mets, these are common things.

It is important to realize that those goals for the day are exactly what they should be doing for him. Getting him pain controlled and able to walk is their goal.

His mother rode in the ambulance with him, and apparently the drivers refused to take him to NYU/Langone, where he is being treated for his cancer. Instead they took him to our shitty local hospital, where he was pumped full of antibiotics on the assumption he had c. diff. 

After several days of antibiotics, test results came back showing no infection after all.

He can barely stand to drink clear liquids because of the nausea, and every time he does, it triggers multiple episodes of painful diarrhea. They have refused to give him an antidiarrheal. 

They aren't offering any other treatments; they just want him to keep trying to drink tiny bits of fluids, and eventually build up to solid food. Given that he starts shitting his brains out the second he puts anything in his mouth, I don't see how that's going to work.

I am both a cancer patient and retired ER doc.  I’m 70 and terminal. I’m blessed to be in the Houston area with MD Anderson. I have spent quite a bit of time both in their ICU and the palliative care ward. Probably the best thing besides their expertise, is that they maintain a full service emergency room staffed with both Oncologist and Emergency Medicine Docs. This emergency room (called acute cancer care clinic for legal reasons) is restricted to established MDA cancer patients.  It avoids all of the confusion a outside hospital may confer. 
MDA is a teaching/academic center. 

I’m not personally involved and can’t legally offer any medical advice. On the surface, it sounds like the current hospital is doing what seems indicated. There seems to be a breakdown in communication here.  I would hope there to be professional cooperation between the different treating entities.

However, she also developed ascites.  And stopped eating, i can't stress enough how important it is to eat protein, consider protein shakes like supportan and prosure.  That will prevent ascites.  

To prevent bedsores use a neumatic mattress.  There are some very cheap online.  They work wonders.

Soft_Raisin5384,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_wkd18r,2,im2ng3d,"I'm so very sorry to read what you are going through.

My late Daughter was diagnosed at late stage 4 at age 23.  We knew something was wrong for a long time.  She was misdiagnosed many times with...IBS, an ulcer, c diff, uti, and one doctor told her to seek behavioral health counseling.  Seriously.  Precious time was lost. 
Was diagnosed when she had obvious swelling and huge volumes of fluid was drained off her belly.  Was also having difficulty breathing. 
 We started treatment in Atlanta. She had debulking surgery and Frontline chemo was at Emory.  She was on a chemo that was used for lung cancer.  After that chemo series she was presented with no treatment options even though the chemo regimen did little, perhaps it was holding the disease at bay, no growth but no reduction.   She did not feel like anyone on the care team there was aggressively fighting for her to find the best treatment available.   She researched on her own and found a good care team at UC health in Colorado.  It was at UC health that we were embraced by a comprehensive team, a oncologist, a pain mgmt doc, a social worker, a therapist, resources to help us navigate how to manage living with the disease, and eventually palliative care and Hospice.
 I believe because of their agressive approach with a new chemo regimine she gained about 6 to 9 months and they were able to improve her quality of life.

Looking back on it I see that it took a village of skilled people to give her the very best experience.  
 In no way were we receiving that with our 1st doctor.

I had pain in my abdomen and shortness of breath.  No appetite.

My primary care doctor did nothing other than take my blood and announce me anemic.

I went to the Emergency Room on August 1st because I could not breath.  I was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure.  

They had to remove an obscenely large volume of fluid from my abdomen and from my lungs.

I have blood clots on my lungs.

But the devastation was that I have stage 4 ovarian cancer.  Treatable, maybe, but not cureable.

I am going to die.  I just don’t know when and I don’t really know what to expect tbh.

I had my first round of chemo last Friday.  Not too bad, actually.  But I feel like I have aged 20 years in a week.

So far my interactions with my oncologist (by default because he was my hospital doctor) have been disappointing.

I want a doctor that cares enough to talk to me.  I want a cancer care team that I can rely upon at a moment’s notice.

After a few rounds of chemo we had a very disappointing visit with a surgeon at MD Anderson that told us there was a 5%chance chef would get him to the point of a liver resection, He basically said go home and do chemo till it stops working. Instead we reached out to Dr. Kemmeny at Memorial Sloan Kettering CC in NYC and she had the HAI pump implanted (that the surgeon at MDA said was old technology. Like, so is the wheel and we use that daily) and 6 months later he had a massive liver resection. Over 15 tumors were removed in various lobe sections, or were ablated. He has had recurrences and is most likely not curable at this point (mets have been in his lungs (had two lung resections), in his lymph nodes, in his liver, on his kidney, etc.) but MSK has always been as aggressive as my husband can take and treated everything.

I am healthy.  I can eat what I want.  My weight is good.  My appetite is TOO good.  I walk about six miles a day.  I even started a new job a year ago.  I tolerate chemo really well and got a great result.

By all means, the dinner and the in house mani/pedi sound like a great treat...and I really feel for you guys - the universe always throws so much chaos at us during these times (i.e. battling cancer, reno... etc) but in time your wife wont care about the reno, or money spent on a gift, she'll just cherish that time you guys had together being you. 

Lastly, one thing worth considering is asking your wife what she wants that day to look like. She's well aware of your whole situation and might not want a big deal made, or might have something in mind that fits for where you guys are at right now (both financially and health wise). 

Fuck Cancer, and I hope you guys have a wonderful birthday together.",t3_x890fc,t1_inhs9cy,2022-09-07 19:50:06,/r/cancer/comments/x890fc/wifes_birthday_coming_up_what_to_do/inhs9cy/,r/cancer,Wife’s birthday coming up. What to do?,"I’ve been fighting stage 4 soft tissue sarcoma for over 5 years. Recently, my chemo treatments are canceled and I’m on Hospice/ palliative care. 
In addition to my situation, we’re dealing with remodel in kitchen and master bath due to a water leak. So, our house is a mess. 

Being realistic, this might be the last birthday I get to spend with her. Money is tight thanks to the remodel and medical bills. 
I had thought about a nice dinner out, but not sure my stamina will last. 
I’ve thought about a spa day with mani &amp; pedicure maybe in house?

Not exactly, although that's what I thought before I got cancer. Hospice is specific to end-of-life, which often involves palliative treatment, but palliative care includes treatment for non-end-of-life and non-terminal cases. 

I had lymphoma with a good prognosis but a brutal chemo regime. The first recommendation I got from a fellow cancer patient was to go to palliative. I saw them after my first round of chemo and I cried harder in that appointment than when I was diagnosed. It was incredible to have someone acknowledge my pain. Anyway, they helped with any and every symptom and side effect -- cancer pain, neuropathy, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, anything. My oncologist was committed to ridding me of cancer, palliative was committed to helping me cope with the process.",t3_xigc5j,t1_ip3ihuk,2022-09-19 18:36:46,/r/cancer/comments/xigc5j/palliative_care_vs_pain_management/ip3ihuk/,r/cancer,,

In some cancer centers they also help to coordinate care between multiple specialists as well. So as time goes on if you're seeing your oncologist, radiologist, neurologist, pulmonologist, and your PCP, palliative will keep them all on the same page and make sure you're not having issues that are slipping through any of the cracks in between these specialists.

mygatito,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_xiiqlm,27,ip4wpge,"Hi mate which country is it? Also how are you performing physically at this moment?

Also where has the cancer spread to?

Ask your doctor - Why hasn't immunotherapy (keytruda drug or others) been recommended?

Metastatic cancer doesn't necessarily mean end of life.  
Sometimes, people even end up with no evidence of disease.

Also it appears that the doctors are moving you to palliative chemo which is low dose chemo.

Here is what you need to do (Time is critical) -

You need to get a 2nd opinion ASAP from doctors in your country - questions like what treatments are available, what combination of chemo drug do they recommend, can they still go for full dose chemo for you?

Dad has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  Was diagnosed in April.  He is still here which is amazing and was on Folfox chemo.  

4 weeks ago at chemo the doc came around and asked how he was going. She asked if the chemo rash he had developed on his ankles had improved - it had. She asked how he was and he said he was fine. That he has no pain, just that he is tired. It was his 9th chemo out of 12.

I made a comment that the podiatrist had come to visit him at home and did the prick test and discovered he had absolutely no feeling whatsoever in his feet. And the doctor shut down the chemo. Said he can no longer be on that chemo because he has developed neuropathy and its too dangerous to have him continue. That there is too much of a risk that  he will fall.

A few chemo sessions before that his cancer markers had risen quite a bit and the doc told us of about 3 or 4 other chemo drugs he could go on if they stayed up. Luckily they went back down but with that knowledge I asked the doctor what would be the next best for him to go on out of those 4 she told us the other day.  She said there is only one he can go on now due to the neuropathy.  I cant remember the name of it  - I have it written down at home. 

Dad doesn't understand that he is dying. He doesn't understand that there is no coming back from this. He honestly believes the chemo will cure him and that everything will be fine.  I told mum that she needs to tell him before we see the oncologist so that he knows what he is going in for.  He thought he was going to be fine. 

Tomorrow he has to go in and decide if he is going to continue trying to fight or if he is going to let himself go on his terms. I know my dad. He is a very simple man and while he knows there's no cure, I know he doesn't comprehend that the end is going to come this year. I know he will chose to go on chemo but he doesn't understand that this chemo is not kind to the body like folfox was. His body will react more than what it had with the other.

I dont know what to do. I dont know what to think or feel. Im so lost. I feel like I can't breathe. I say I need to go to the shops and I just put on my metal and scream into the steering wheel on the side of the road.  Everyday dad is becoming less and less mobile. He lies about his pain. He won't take care of himself - if nurses didn't come 3 times a week I think he would only shower once just to stop mum nagging him. Its been 3 weeks since he has brushed his teeth. No amount of begging or pleading or anger will make him brush his teeth. He will Tomorrow though because he doesn't want us to tell the doctor he isnt brushing his teeth. 

What do I do? I dont know what to do. I don't want him to go on like this but I know he will chose to fight and I am terrified of what it is going to do to him.  I dont want him to go through this anymore but I don't want to lose him. 

I hate myself that I made that comment about his feet. He could still be on that chemo if I hadn't opened my stupid mouth. If I hadn't said anything then he wouldn't have to make this decision for a while. The guilt is crushing that there are moments I cant breathe.

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_xk069m,2,ipdh24u,"It sounds like there is a lot going on and it’s all contributing to you feeling completely overwhelmed.

Are you going to the appointment with your dad or is your mom going with him? I think the doctor needs to be very clear with your dad about what’s going on. I don’t think either you or your mom should take on the responsibility. Someone in that appointment needs to ask the doctor what type of timeframe he is looking at. The doctor should also be able to answer a question about what that timeframe looks like with treatment, what that timeframe looks like without treatment, and what side effects and quality of life your dad can expect during treatment. Without knowing these things, A patient can’t make an informed decision. In the US, we have palliative care doctors who participate in these conversations. I really believe that the doctor has to take the lead here as the expert voice and make sure your dad understand the reality of his situation. 

The doctor should also participate in a discussion about quality of life as it relates to your dad’s hygiene, pain and other symptoms or side effects he may not even have told you about. It sounds like your dad is experiencing deep depression, and that’s common for cancer patients. And it sounds like he’s using denial as a coping mechanism, also not uncommon. But these things can be addressed by his care team. 

I’m sorry you’re feeling so crushed by guilt, but there’s a very good reason why they can’t let him continue if he can’t feel his feet. If you hadn’t said anything, he might have taken a fall and broken his hip and he’d be totally screwed. By the way, cancer patients feel that way about side effects too. It’s terrifying to have to report side effects to your doctor because you’re afraid it means they’re going to stop treatment. But you have to be responsible. You have to own up to side effects because if you don’t, they can become extremely serious.

Are you scared every day of getting heart disease? Having a stroke? Getting in a deadly or life changing car accident?

All these things are among the most common ways for people to die.

You're in remission, which means no cancer can be detected, but they will check regularly just for your peace of mind.

Meanwhile, each time you go to and leave the hospital (no matter how you get there) you are probably statistically more likely to die in an accident than from the cancer recurring, especially since with regular checkups, it's likely to be caught early if it does return.

My uncle had Hodgkins disease when he was 21. His doctor put him off for months, insisting the lump in his neck was just a cyst. His mother (a nurse) made him go back 4 times. My uncle is a man's man and not one to complain, or keep complaining, or ""waste"" a doctors time. It took a lot of persuading, badgering, nagging and just generally being a stubborn old... nurse, to get him to keep going back.

Needless to say, this delay in diagnosis was not helpful.

Anyway, you know the outcome, hodgkins. Then followed surgery, radiation, and chemo. He spent weeks in hospital. He nearly died twice and his chest is covered in large, ugly scars (keyhole wasn't a thing back then).

He's 65 or 66 now, and the disease has never returned. I believe after 5 years his checks went from yearly to every 5 years, and after 25 years he was fully discharged from the service.

Treatments have come on a lot since then, so you stand a better chance than he did. But any statistics you read on life expectancy are just statistics, your chances of guessing which group you'll fall into down to pure luck, or bad luck.

I had a 9% chance of surviving a year but I'm responding ridiculously well to the palliative chemo and am actually hopeful I might even get to the no evidence of disease stage (it's too far gone for me to ever be declared in remission).

Just take it as a warning to get your priorities straight and live your best life because tomorrow, you could get hit by a bus. And you have no idea how many people are injured each year by their pants/trousers. Duvet/quilt injuries, and even deaths, are also common. Don't even get me started on the dangers of stairs!

Pick 2-3 hospitals in the US as in your case US is the ideal option.

So this post is about the emotional impact of getting diagnosed with cancer. 

I was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic) aka bile duct cancer.
It's been around a month since I got my diagnoses but I have yet to have an emotional response, or at least not the emotional response one would expect. 

I never got the feeling of dread, sadness, impending doom, or any other unpleasant emotion. I have been very matter of fact about the whole thing. 

Is this something any of you have experienced? Is my emotional center on the fritz or something ?

How did you react?


EDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing. That is very interesting that it seems so common to react like I do amongst those with cancer. I'm a bit relieved now."

Your partner wants you around. That's a plus for staying.

Nobody knows your prognosis - that's a neutral.

I'd stick around. Start treatment and see where it leads you. If you start suffering. If the pain starts to be too much and affects the quality of your life maybe then you could stop treatment and go for hospice or palliative care.

In my case - I've stage IV lung cancer - I decided on my options 2 years back:

As long as I'm not in serious pain


                                AND
I've still got my metal faculties


                                AND
I'm not too much of a burden to my family


                                AND
I don't get invited to the pity parties much



Then I stay. The main things are not being in constant pain and not being a burden to my family. 

With a lot of luck and some decent treatment breaks I could be around for another 10 to 15. As long as it's not in pain - that's worth fighting for.



You're not being selfish, my friend, you're being pragmatic. As long as you can squeeze a few drops of joy out of life then you should stay. When it gets too much, bow out gracefully

Option B is to get all treatment possible, including surgery and chemo, possibly extending life and dragging loved ones through the process.  
My spouse is in favor of B because she wants me around as long as possible.  
I’m in favor of A because I’ve cared for loved ones through a long decline and I don’t want to put my family through it. 
My cancer is extremely rare EWSR1-CREM fusion.  Prognosis is poor but mostly unknown.   
I’ve had surgery and it seemed successful but consensus from the tumor board is that the margins aren’t big enough and want to try again.  
At this point I feel fine.  I have ct scans in December as part of my plan and want to wait to see what’s up.  My dr thinks that is risky because of the aggressive nature and although surgery is a possibility later if it’s detectable I will then also need chemo.

tamaith,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_y09c2b,11,irs1rol,"I had a tumor next to my iliac artery so I was inoperable and that sounds like the case with your wife. I am HPV+ and no markers were found in my biopsies or blood. No visible lesions and my cervical and uterine biopsies showed nothing. I was confirmed HPV+ SCC through a EGD aspiration biopsy of a node in my chest. I got chemo of Taxol, Carboplatin, Avastin + Keytruda. Started last December. My Dx went from cervical cancer to endometrial cancer somewhere in my treatment, but it was weird. The end game numbers were stage IVb metastatic disease, and probably incurable.   


I saw 4 oncologists and only 2 were willing to treat me, one of the two was 'wait and see what the biopsy showed'. Because I responded well to chemo I was able to get radiation to my pelvis and chest when previously I was told it was too much area to radiate - but the good chemo results made it possible. I have separate oncologists for my chemo and radiation and both are taking care of my follow up treatments.     
The worsening of the pain she is describing sounds like neuropathy from the chemo I experienced, in addition to the gabapentin she should ask about taking a vitamin B complex supplement, there are some studies that show it seems to help reduce or prevent nerve damage. Wearing cheap hospital issue compression hose was the only way I could sleep on some post chemo days, I would get cramping and a sensation like firecrackers going off in my legs and the counter pressure did help. The gabapentin was no help for me at that time but it passed fairly quickly, a few days post treatment and I was fine.  
After my radiation+cisplatin treatments I have a lot of scar tissue in my pelvis and chest but that is to be expected and was part of the treatment plan. I am now NED and everything is back to normal. Everything still works as it should even though I think my bowels will never be the same again. The way my radiation oncologist explained it to me is they set up barriers of scar tissue to keep the tumor contained if it does return. I have no idea how much of my lymph system was involved or destroyed in the process but I am feeling the effects of it. I was told if I do need pelvic surgery in the future I will lose my colon and bladder in the process because of that scar tissue.   


I am now on Keytruda as an off label test for maintenance, infusions every 3 weeks. I was told I will be on this for the rest of my life. I don't have the markers it is proven to work with so they are trying to prove that it will work on cancers of my type.  


In regards to my neuropathy the sensations in my feet are coming back and it no longer feels like I have carpet glued to the bottom of my feet, The sensations made my feet so sensitive even socks irritate my feet and I have to tape up my toes at work, it has changed my gait so I am now getting knee and leg pain with foot cramps. Most recent was last night with my left leg, hip, and knee swelling and cramping but the gabapentin and an aleve and a pillow under my legs is all I needed to deal with the pain and sleep well. My lymph nodes were radiated so I do get frequent swelling of the lower legs, I use compression hose at home and elevation to deal with this. I looked up some lymphedema massage techniques on YouTube and got a soft bath brush to do the lymph massage on my legs. It does feel good and seems to help. 

There are even compression gloves if her hands are affected too. The sensations I get in my arms are not the same as the ones I feel from my legs, they are more of a burning  electric shock sensation than the firecracker/cramping sensation I get on my legs. Cramps in my hand are just really my hand refusing to act, no pain at all but my thumb and fingers will just refuse to move until I stretch them back to position. I do wear compression sleeves at work and there is a huge difference when I forget to wear them.   


I can still stand and walk without an aid and go to work and my swelling is minor on the lymphedema scale and something I can deal with at home. A single aleve is all I need to get through a workday. I know this is like a drop in the bucket to the pain your wife must be feeling. Inflammation is a side effect to the immunotherapy and I think this may have a hand in the joint pain I am getting now and how I have had to adjust my walking, overall I tolerated my chemo and radiation well even though it was not without it's own type of suffering. When I read on here how bad some people are doing with their chemo my heart just breaks because I went though it like nothing compared to others. I worked through chemo and my side effects were minimal. It has not impacted my quality of life post treatment much at all and I am not sure how much is treatment related or just getting older.   


You got to remember that chemo tears your body apart on a cellular level, and your body has to put itself back together. This takes strength, energy, and pain. Fatigue is going to happen. You are doing right listening to the doctors and palliative care.  Let them know of all side effects and track them on a calendar, I use a happy planner - the month calendar for appointments and the weekly I use as a journal and symptom tracker. It does help during appointments.    


Best of luck to you both, take care.",t3_y09c2b,t1_irs1rol,2022-10-10 16:35:01,/r/cancer/comments/y09c2b/looking_for_chemo_patient_user_experiences/irs1rol/,r/cancer,Looking for Chemo Patient User Experiences,"Good day, strangers.

My wife has a recurrence of cervical cancer. Doctors are giving her 1-2 years with treatment. We're still processing but it's been an insane emotional rollercoaster these past several weeks. In early September we found out she has a tumor about the size of a nectarine near the base of her spine that's also encasing the arteries feeding her legs causing swelling, pain, and mobility impairment. We've been told the cancer is also in the lymphatic system but hasn't spread to other major organs yet. She's now being treated as a palliative patient to help improve her quality of life.

Her chemo treatment will include Carboplatin, Bevacizumab, and Paclitaxel, 6-8 rounds of treatment over the next 4+ months. She will also have immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab). She had her first treatment (7 hours of chemo + 4-hour blood transfusion) 5 days ago and a few days later, noticed terrible knee joint pain (burning and aching), extreme fatigue, and tingling/shooting pains mostly in the hands and legs/feet. After speaking with her pain management team, she has been prescribed Gabapentin (day 2 use and no signs of improvement). She's also taking hydromorphone and Tylenol to deal with the constant pain.  

Does anyone have user stories regarding these treatments that they'd be willing to share?  I know reaction cases can be different from person to person but perhaps hearing from those with experience might offer us some reassurance.

We're doing our best to maintain a positive perspective but it's been so challenging, especially this past week and we're very scared for what's to come recognizing that our time is so precious, now more than ever.

Thanks and FUCK cancer!"

The doctor or a nurse who can talk to her and understand why she won’t take her medication. In the US, she could see a palliative care doctor who could try to understand her state of mind and whether refusing medication is her way of saying that she is ready to stop treatment. Having surgery that is incredibly risky and will only allow her to eat, it sounds very risky. It’s hard to understand exactly how well she can communicate her desires, But has your uncle tried talking to her very frankly about whether she actually wants to stop treatment all together and simply receive comfort care until she passes? If she’s able to talk and can articulate what she wants, it would be worth someone trying to have a frank discussion with her.

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_y1lfdb,25,iry85d1,"Is the “they” the doctors? I think doctors do respect a patient’s decision not to pursue treatment, at least they are supposed to. Has your husband clearly articulated to them that he has decided to forgo all treatment?

How recently did he have his last pet scan? I am not clear on why your husband is refusing to get that. It’s not treatment, it isn’t invasive. And it will let them understand how far his cancer has progressed.  If your husband has decided that he doesn’t want any more treatment for his cancer, knowing where it’s located in his body can help them as things progress. It’s great that he feels absolutely fine but at some point he won’t. I think getting a pet scan to benchmark where he is could help with his comfort/palliative care going forward. Of course if he doesn’t wanna do that either, that’s his choice. But personally I don’t understand it. I can understand somebody deciding to stop treatment but refusing a scan, A little less understandable.

I have to say that your post does disturb me a little, I don’t know how old your husband is but saying that life is depressing so why not just let the cancer take over and kill him… when he’s feeling fine physically, that sounds like it’s some thing that could be addressed with therapy and I get that he won’t go. His doctor should still respect his wishes once he states them clearly, but if a doctor gets the sense that it’s depression or emotional distress that is driving the decision, maybe that’s why the doctors are pushing back?

Even so, once he tells a doctor that his decision is firm and he’s not going to get treatment, he just wants to be kept comfortable and pain-free as much as possible, that should be the end of his oncologist pushing him.",t3_y1lfdb,t1_iry85d1,2022-10-11 22:37:52,/r/cancer/comments/y1lfdb/why_cant_they_respect_my_husbands_decision/iry85d1/,r/cancer,Why can't they respect my husband's decision?,"Lung cancer - it was stage 1B at initial diagnosis (early 2020, that was SUPER fun).

They ended up doing a complete hysterectomy, but to our surprise, they didn’t take any lymph nodes even though they said they would. 

Fast forward 4 weeks, I’d been giving her daily injections, and they called to say she needed a PET scan because the cancer wasn’t contained within just the uterus. When they examined what they removed, the cancer had also gotten into the cervix, which surprised even the medical team. Yesterday mum had the scan, and today after I finished work I noticed a lot of texts on my phone to call mum asap.

So the scan results show the cancer got into the lymph nodes, and has gone as far as the carotid artery. There are also lesions on her lungs they’re concerned about…and she mentioned a few other places, but my head went fuzzy and I don’t remember where else it is. They asked if she wanted to continue with the planned radiation and chemo, or just leave it…to me that sounds like the medical team don’t hold out much hope. I’m just numb right now, but I have to be the strong one. I have to let her go through whatever emotions she needs to go through right now…but I don’t know what to do.

He's struggled off and on with quitting smoking (he'd gone two months without it until the recent diagnosis), and he also has COPD, but he literally feels fine. Sure, he can't run a marathon (or up a flight of stairs) but it has no impairment on his daily life. It seems to absolutely baffle them, because on paper he should feel really sick, and he doesn't. It also seems less real to us because he DOES feel fine. He feels as good as the day he was diagnosed.

But they keep pushing him to do another PET scan. He doesn't want to. He doesn't want to do chemo. Frankly, things the past few years have been so-so at best, employment for both of us (he's only working part time and I lost the last two jobs because yanno, it's kind hard to keep it together at work when your personal life is crumbling), moving across the country, our relationship has been iffy...

I'm not saying there isn't anything for him to live for, but life has been kinda depressing for a long time with little likely to change, so why not just go out on his own terms?

Of course he won't see a therapist...

Maybe I'm just ranting here, but if they could just let him live his life so we can enjoy the time we have left (and max out the credit cards in the process since we aren't legally married and the debt would die with him) and he not be a human pincushion, that would be great.

Edit, since someone asked - he's 61, coming out of a 40+ year career in a dying industry."

I suffered from pneumonitis, post chest radiation, and I couldn't walk 10 steps without losing my breath and I was in so much pain from the burning in my chest, etc. My Oncologist put me on temporary steroids, prednisone. I took them for 6 weeks and I felt like superwoman 🦸‍♀️ during that time. It was a miracle to get such relief. I was able to do so many things that I couldn't before. I felt like a whole new person during that time. 

Once I was healed from the pneumonitis though, we tapered off the steroids. It was a life saver for me and greatly improved my quality of life. Please ask your Oncologist, not palliative care, about maybe trying daily prednisone temporarily.  See what they say about it. It's worth a shot to ask anyway. We have to advocate for ourselves.

I told my palliative care doctor and he said “no, if you’re going to take that, it should be constant,” (and here’s where I fucked up), I missed the rest which was “…and that’s why I never prescribe them.” In my chemo fog mind , I heard “take them (2 tablets daily) starting now.”

I have lost almost all my energy. I can’t stand up without several rounds of yesyesyesmaybenope. Apparently this isn’t just chemo - it’s the steroids amplifying the weakness to the nth degree. I’m tapering off them but the doctor said it could take months to get my energy back. I have months to live, so my question is, “Is this my new normal?” Do others have experience in this? I’m not ready to be carried from room to room or pushed around in a wheelchair - I think I have more to give in me. I’m just scared this is permanent.

My surgeons are happy with the work they did, and they managed to take out all the little nodules invading my peritoneal cavity. 

However the histopathology came back and after speaking with my onc, I am terrified. He calls it Stage 4 (!!!) and is certain the cancer will come back if I go off my hormone blockers. He does think I can have a good and normal life and I’ll be fine as long as I am good with the medications. But what happens when the cancer becomes resistant to the meds? 

“We‘ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”

They offered him prophylactic radiation to his body and brain, to hopefully slow down the chance of a brain met.

Personally I would be exploring what all the options are. With my chemo I’ve had “holidays”, lowered dosages, etc.

I wonder if you just need to give yourself some time to regroup? It’s not like you can’t change your mind whatever you decide for now.

I think it’s a good sign though that you understand your limits and when you need a break.",t3_ycrn3t,t1_itpd6cr,2022-10-25 10:05:39,/r/cancer/comments/ycrn3t/everything_is_crap/itpd6cr/,r/cancer,Everything is crap,"Things aren’t looking good and I don’t see any hope.

He has been told that after this new chemo protocol he switched to in April that there were no other options if it didn't work. This is what has happened and now they are saying to go on Lonsurf as a last resort. 

They said it Lonsurf doesn't work then they will explore clinical trials for him which will have to be self funded as they aren't covered by our country's healthcare. This isn't really an option for my uncle so while I would absolutely be researching new medications and clinical trials, if they aren't funded by the NHS then it's a no-go.

I understand what you are saying about the treatment not working but given how many other growths occurred with the 1st chemo protocol before they said ""this isn't working"" it seems odd to say that the 2nd chemo isn't working after the first sign of growth, when they have mentioned all other growths are still dormant.

The issue is that the oncologist wasn't initially giving anymore information. They gave my uncle a few options and then immediately followed it up with what do you want to do then? Not giving him any time to research or question further.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally my struggle is seeing my uncle doing all of these fulfilling things so independently while the oncologist's are talking about palliative care and last resorts for treatment. It doesn't match up with what I ""thought"" their life would be like when I expected doctor's to start talking like this I suppose, but as I said I've never dealt with any of this before so it could just be me having a very unrealistic expectation or misconception.",t3_ydi44y,t1_itu9k1x,2022-10-26 10:59:31,/r/cancer/comments/ydi44y/how_can_lonsurf_be_the_right_suggestion_when_my/itu9k1x/,r/cancer,,

I agree with everyone else that the foundation of the pain treatment will most likely be an opioid (such as oxycodone), which is a narcotic, but really effective for pain.

NecessaryFile5763,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_u93lvq,1,iu4a4f8,"My mom was diagnosed on March of this year. Stage 4 she had fluid buildup in her lungs, that at first thought came from COvid she also had earlier this year. She found out because she abdominal pain which she attributed to gallbladder which had to be removed. The surgery was performed and they found peritoneal nodules and fluid buildup. Keep in mind that on December and January she had some blood work done and nothing came out. Not even in the tumor markers. The doctors from the hospital in Ecuador told us that there was nothing left to do and to give her palliative care, cause she was not going to resist chemotherapy, she's had several now. My sister and I brought her to the States and she has started treatment. The doctor here said that her cancer will respond well to her treatment which has given us hope. A hysterectomy was performed on her and the doctor said he found it in the ovaries (the scans couldn't spot the main tumor at first) but it had ""very little cancer"" (his words). He saw that the surrounding area was very clean aside from a superficial cancer that spread on her colon, which he managed to remove, so basically the treatment had worked according to him. He advised us schedule an appointment with her oncologist to have a few more chemo sessions. She will go for 2 more this month and on January, and if everything goes well she will be in remission. Her CA 125 is at 5.2 now. 

What can I say she's been amazing throughout this. Giving us all strength. My prayers have been answered and I feel more at peace now. Her family has been supportive calling her and praying with her. She says she's more than certain she will survive this and that she even had dreams of being declared cancer free. I wish your mother well OP. Hopefully her and my mom can be part of that statistic of women who were cured.

It had spread all over in her pelvic region, and she had two nodules in her lungs. Chemo was started immediately and she responded very well to it. After the first 3 sessions, the tumors had reduced significantly and she had surgery to remove any tumors along with a hysterectomy.

She finished her 6 chemo treatments in August 2020 and in November 2020, her CT scan results came back clear. Every month her blood work is taken to check for tumor markers and every 3 months she has a CT scan. From November 2020 until now, all her CT scans have come back clear and so has her month blood reports.

Today she got the results back from her most recent blood test and the 15-3 marker came back at 28 (26 being the high point). Her onco is pretty matter of fact and doesn't say much, she's hoping to talk to him tomorrow but he told her before tumor markers don't mean much and they can be off, the CT result is what has to be looked at.

For 1.5 years my mom has been cancer free and also taking oral medication called ZEJULA. She also religiously takes CBD twice a day and THC at night before going to bed. Her cancer has been kept completely at bay with no signs of returning.

I dont even know what I'm trying to ask, my mind is in a whirlwind, I love my mom dearly and the thought of her cancer coming back is making me sick to my stomach. Have any of you lived a long life after having stage 4 ovarian cancer? Or do any of you know someone that has? My mom has responded so well thus far, I just want to know if there's a chance her cancer never fully returns?

Also, how much weight do you put in the tumor markers?

Everybody is different and you can only speak to the level of pain that you feel. Somebody else telling you that this is normal doesn’t get rid of your pain.

sudiptallica,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_yb2898,1,ivdx5y2,"@Hooded DM, i feel you. My dad was also diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in October 2022. His bloodwork indicated he had a PSA levels of 507 ng/ml. The highest can be is 4.1 for reference range. Multiple extensive bone metastasis and infiltration of lymph nodes. All at the same time his uroflowmetry is normal. It spread silently for all this time. Our ortho doc said, the bone mets likely have been initiated in the past 6-12 months. So the 2-3 months timeline should not have caused the bone mets. But he could have placed been on ADT 2/3 months earlier, that is unfortunate. 


Our medical oncologist has started Androgen Deprivation Therapy one day after meeting him for the 1st time, and due to be given his 1st chemo in the coming weeks.

I hope for your dad the ADT is already initiated. The earlier it is done, the better for him and to put a brake on it for now.

The cancer eventually stops responding to ADT and a change of treatment plan is required then, which your medical oncologist will orchestrate. Whenever in doubt seek a 2nd /3rd opinion to be sure the treatment regimen is correct. 

But do keep up hope, with good lifestyle and treatment the progression free period can be increased drastically.

I guess it is not at a curable stage now, and the intent would be palliative care. Dont freak out on this info. E. g., diabetes cannot be cured and you have to take care/manage the symptoms accordingly.

He received bloodwork in May 2022 that showed he might have cancer. The doctor forgot to send the results to a specialist for over two months. By the time a specialist was able to see him in October (doctor had covid for 2 weeks then on vacation for 2 more), they found out he had prostate cancer with 5 locations in his bones. Because of the several delays by the doctors, it's spread into his bones.

&amp;#x200B;

 The specialist says they usually do chemo/radiation if the spread is in less then 5 locations but because it's 5places they won't treat him. They said that they will give him medication to try to prolong his life but that's all they can do.

If anyone has been through this before, what question should he be asking at his next specialist appointment. They will be reviewing all the locations of cancer in his bones + prostate. Does anyone know of any treatments or experimental drugs he should be asking about?"

Last month I started chemo, and I'm on a relatively short course since my cancer is less of beast and more of an annoying mosquito. Nonetheless the thing I did not expect or get warned about was managing the symptoms of everything happening. I'm almost done since my second round of 3 is basically done and I feel like I have no right to even post about it here but I feel like this is as fitting of a place to get the most real answers if any.    

I feel like I've become a slave to what's wrong with me today or tomorrow or the next day, I know you gotta stay strong but that usually includes having a way to fight with but right now it feels like I'm just receiving a beating. You take the chemo, chemo gives you nausea, you take meds for the nausea, they leave you basically immobile for almost a week. You take shots for immunity, suffer from diarrhea. Deal with diarrhea and now I'm nauseous and afraid to eat anything because I've literally emptied everything in my stomach the night before, but now I need to eat something that makes my stomach sit but I'm afraid that will make me throw up.     

I understand that I brought nothing new and chemo is a bitch and people have dealt with WAY worse, but I really want to hear personal experiences. How did you deal with it? Is it reasonable to expect the doctor to give you medicine for ever single thing cause that doesn't sound right. I've read my chemo guide book like 20 times and it's nothing but vague general tips that apply to any sick person not just chemo patients.     

My treatment is really short, 60 days if things go accordingly, and the doctor said it would be heavy, but I can't manage my expectations. They told me my cancer is relatively treatable with over a 90% chance of cure but then I've been told over and over that I'm taking a heavy dose. Then again my heavy doses are no where near what I see other people suffering through every single day for years.    

This post is mostly a rant and I feel real shit complaining about real trivial stuff when there are people fighting a battle with an unknown outcome everyday better than I ever could, but those bunch of trivial stuff have drained me and I don't know how to keep dealing with it constantly I'm even hesitant to do a simple check up tomorrow.      

Thanks and sorry."

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_yptctn,14,ivl3sgq,"I’m sorry things are taking so long. I don’t know if it helps to know that this is something that has come about since Covid. It’s taking longer for scans to be scheduled and longer for biopsies to be scheduled and longer to get test results. I believe that patients need to be squeaky wheels and advocate for themselves, but sometimes you can’t get satisfaction. 

I suggest that you contact an oncology social worker at your cancer center, someone to help act as an advocate for you and to advise you how best to navigate the system. I also suggest that you immediately ask for a referral to palliative care. You don’t have to suffer with pain while you wait for this CT scan. And lastly, if you run into delays with any of those two things, you immediately contact the patient advocate or whatever it’s called at your cancer center. Tell them you’re in pain and you’re not getting the help you need.

This assumes that you have given your oncologist a red alert that you cannot wait for the CT scan and you need pain relief now and they haven’t given you any help. You need to let your oncologist be 100% aware that you can’t live with this pain for another day, you have to say it that clearly.

You’re not getting the care you need. You’re not getting the pain relief you need. In a perfect world, we would get the care we needed without putting up a fight for it.

_-Loki,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_yptctn,12,ivln8ic,"You are being let down in the worst way. 

I saw my GP on February the first, my preliminary blood results worried her so she phoned me and asked me to admit myself to hospital that evening. I felt like a hypochondriac because my only symptom was breathlessness. 

On the second I had my CT scan. Stage 4. 

Later that same day I had my colonoscopy so they could take biopsies. 

During the next 4 weeks I had further blood tests, an MIR and two meetings with my consultants. The first meeting was to confirm things (basically, girl, you gon die!) and the second was to discuss treatment. 

I began palliative chemo on February the 28th. So far I'm reacting very well. The primary cancer is all but gone, although the metastases will still kill me eventually. I was given 1 to 2 years with chemo, 18 month average, but everything is shrinking. At most I feel bad for 4 days every two weeks, from my chemo, which means I have 10 days when I'm fine. Honestly, I have more side effects from the chemo than I ever had symptoms from the cancer. But it's keeping me alive so I try not to complain. And like I said, I have many more good days than bad. 

Given how everything's going, I'm hopeful I might defy the odds but even of not, I intend to make the most of the time I have left. i created a bucket list of fun things to do and my friends and family get together with me one weekend a month and we do some things from the list. I've joined local groups and I'm out there, meeting new people and trying new things. 

You need to make some noise and if possible, get yourself admitted to hospital. In-patients always take precedence over outpatients. If you're in pain, go to the ER, kick up a fuss, play up your symptoms. If you can't do that, I'm sure your wife can do it for you and demand you be seen and admitted. 

It's an old adage but it's true, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. One of you needs to get loud and start complaining. 

Finally, this is not the end. Once you're on proper pain relief and treatment, things will look up. And besides, you're only stage 3.

OffMyRocker2016,t5_2qixx,cancer,t1_ivw58mm,3,ivw858r,"Thank you so much. Yes, I've definitely got plenty of love and support around me. My diagnosis is certainly terminal and I'm as okay with it as I can be. I have a great team of doctors and a lovely Palliative Care team, too. I'm grateful. 

Anyway, it does seem that there's something seriously wrong in your father's situation. I can really see your concerns better now being that you are allowed his medical info and they're still stalling you. That's got to be beyond frustrating to say the least.

I can't help but wonder if you should consider changing hospitals by asking for a transfer somewhere else. That may prod them into telling you what's going on. Truly, there's no reason for this to be taking so long in terms of getting the biopsy results, etc. I'm actually angry about this, too, because this is serious business and they're wasting even more precious time. 

As for your father not advocating for himself much, that's unfortunately pretty typical for many men in the older generations. They always say they're fine, even when they're not. That's the way they were raised. They're told they're fine all the time so why wouldn't they believe differently? 

My father was the same way. He dealt with a ton of pain for a very long time and by the time he decided to see the doctor about it, it was too late. He was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer that had spread throughout his body and he only lived another 8 months after diagnosis.

I think you should try calling the hospital administrator if you don't hear back from the doctor you called. You could also try asking to speak with the head nurse at the nurse's station on your father's floor. See if they can help you in some way with the communication problem. Maybe they can at least give you an idea is what's really going on and explain why you're waiting so long for information. It's worth a try anyway.

The last three weeks of his life were so traumatic and he declined very quickly. I didn’t even recognize him. He wasn’t sleeping and sitting at the edge of his bed everyday in severe pain. He would just look at me and cry. He had expressive and receptive aphasia and was very confused most of the time. One night he looked at me and held my hand. He said “ I just wanted you to have a father.” He fought so hard. He was on a dilauded drip and it was shut off because he was breathing 4x a minute and the dr said anytime he would pass away. Well, after it was turned off, he woke up and tried to get out of bed and did whatever he could because he wasn’t ready to go. He saw me, grabbed me and  gave me the biggest hug. He was put back on the drip and passed later that night. 

My dad was a badass. 34 years in the Air Force / air national guard and retired as senior master Sgt. he worked as a police officer as well and studied for his masters at the same time when I was a kid.

She only has medicare/medicaid insurance, and a little over a month ago her Oncologist told her that the chemo (not immune therapy as she is immunocompromised) was slowing growth, but not reducing the size and therefore her insurance would no longer pay for it. She wanted radiation for pain and he refused and completely ended her care and told her to go on hospice. We were both pretty shaken that they wanted her to go into hospice so soon after diagnosis.

Neither of us fully understood hospice, and she didn't want to go on it since she was afraid that she would lose her social security and home health care. So since then she has only been treating her pain with motrin and oxycodone, and now her pain is at a debilitating level where she can't eat or go to the bathroom. I researched and found out she wouldn't lose her social security or home health care (at least according to google) and that they would provide radiation treatment for pain relief.

In the meanwhile enjoy every day to the fullest.

Even if it is terminal, have fun activities with her, let her eat all her favourite foods, she will need the nutrition. I wanted to go with my mom to her parent's parent country (they were political refugees) but unfortunately for us she didn't make it...

Unfortunately she couldn't because she was afraid her heart couldn't take it (she also had heart problems).

I can only advise you to also seek some therapy (both of you, you need to talk to someone about what you're going through) especially in these times, but also take some time to yourself as well when you will start taking care of her.

Ignoring it and hoping it will go away is not an option. How do you get over the anxiety enough to even make the phone call?
AggravatingAccident2,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_ywrfv5,10,iwkx0dg,"Long Version of the points with examples:

1. I have multiple examples of you requesting medical info from my care team (and two incidents of them giving you that info) without my knowledge or permission. I filed HIPAA violations on the staff who failed to notice that you were not authorized to get or receive info on my behalf. **From now on, if my care team gets in touch with you, your first question needs to be “have you talked to (my name) about this, and, if so, did (my name) authorize you in writing to manage my medical info or plan?”** If either answer is “NO” (like it currently is), then refer them to me and hang up. 
2. You need to be honest and stop trying to blow smoke up my ass. Last week when you asked me to request a prescription for X “just in case” my bullshit alarm went off. And because you are abysmally bad at keeping secrets, it didn’t take much to discover you had decided behind my back that I was on too many medications. I take ONLY what my palliative care doctor has prescribed, and yes, he has a list of every medication including OTC meds or supplements, that I’m on. **If you can’t be an adult and include me in key discussions, then I’m not so sure I can actually trust you to be my Medical POA when the time comes.**
3. You need to let me vent without you taking it as a call to action. I have multiple incidents where I tried talking to you about what I’m going through, only to discover later that you’re ten steps into carrying out a detailed care plan I have no knowledge of, or input into. **Try talking to me, or better yet, shut up and listen to what I’m saying before doing things that may be at odds with what my care team and I have decided.**
4. You need to start respecting my right to body autonomy. You make me feel like a thing rather than a person when you violate my space. The worst was last month when you walked up, removed my mask, and stuck your disgusting dirty fingers into my mouth to check for mouth sores when you could have fucking asked permission first. I don’t regret that ass chewing I gave you once I stopped being stunned. Don’t touch me unless I am ok with you touching me. I felt so violated that day, and I’m still angry about it; **I am not an incoherent piece of meat.** Not yet. 
5. You need to understand that just because you read something somewhere, you aren’t an expert. Yes, I’m including you, my medical doctor sister who last saw a living patient back in your residency in field A and before you switched to field B. You in particular suck at things like what isolating for Covid entails, or taking my BP by wrapping your Apple Watch around my wrist tight enough to leave a mark. I checked and that’s not how it works, just like quarantining doesn’t require me to eat my meals outside in the rain as that’s the only safe way for me to take my mask off. 
6. Try growing compassion. When I said my goal was to live to see Xmas, you responded that it was a foolish pipe dream and that I needed to get it straight that I’ll be dead way before then. Guess what? I’m still here and going strong with Thanksgiving plans for next week. Also, telling me I’ll never see your kids again unless I disregard my doctors’ recommendations and stop all treatments in favor of accelerating the dying process doesn’t exactly give me hope that you are trustworthy.",t3_ywrfv5,t1_iwkx0dg,2022-11-16 12:00:42,/r/cancer/comments/ywrfv5/dear_family/iwkx0dg/,r/cancer,Dear Family,"

I’m writing this draft to my family who I hope continue to be IT-challenged enough that they won’t recognize me (if they do, then good on you).I’m mainly venting to the community because I need to understand if I’m being a “cancer-zilla” or if my anger is justified BEFORE going directly to my family. FYI: This is the short version - I’ll put the long version in a comment.

Dear Family: First, I love that you want to help me, and I am not ungrateful for that help. I know how lucky I am to have you in my life. That being said, I hope the following are honest mistakes, but I worry they are not because you keep doing things behind my back that puts my trust meter into the red. This dying business is hard enough without my having to question every interaction we have.

1. I have multiple examples of you requesting medical info (and at least two incidents of them giving you that info) without my knowledge or permission.  **From now on, if my care team gets in touch with you, your first question needs to be “have you talked to (my name) about this, and, if so, did (my name) authorize you in writing to manage her medical info or plan?”** If either answer is “NO” (like it currently is), then refer them to me and hang up.

4. You need to start respecting my right to body autonomy. You make me feel like a thing rather than a person when you violate my space. **I am not an incoherent piece of meat.** Not yet. 

5. You need to understand that just because you read something somewhere, you aren’t an expert. It’s laughable hearing you tell me you know all about cancer pain when you’ve never had a condition where you needed pain meds more than two to three days. Try living under medicated for three straight weeks in a row then we’ll talk about how I just need to talk to my pain and let it go. Until then, shove your meditation over medication shite up your ass. 

6. Try compassion. When you want to play tough cop, save it. I am listening to what my doctors recommend, not what you think should happen. **My death is the one time in my life where I get to be selfish and do what I think is best.** When you’re dying you can make different plans for yourself."

I want to give you some kind of comfort or reassurance but there are just no right words, only an echo of how I imagine you must feel and me trying to keep from crying.


They NEED to be made to hear this.  They NEED to be made to respect your decisions, your autonomy, your boundaries and your legal rights.  It is clear that they have NO idea what your current reality is.  They do not understand your physical pain and probably are not even capable of imagining what you are feeling physically, much less emotionally.  


The healthier they are, the less they seem able to comprehend what is actually happening and the more determined they seem to be to convince you that whatever bullshit they have hatched in their heads is going to banish your pain and make you go back to being whatever you always were for them.


The care team members that have given in to your relatives' demands for information, etc need to be reported for breaking your area's medical privacy laws so they can be disciplined for disregarding your legal rights.


The family members who are actively working to interfere with your care decisions and trample your autonomy need to be cut off both socially and legally.  Consult a lawyer to discover your specific rights and what you need to do to ensure that these people do not steal your autonomy and interfere with your final care.  I know it sucks.  You shouldn't have to deal with this on top of what you already have to bear.  


Finally, do not let ANYONE tell you that your pain isn't real or that you shouldn't be allowed to do whatever you legally can to get what comfort is possible in regards to your palliative care.  If you need opioids to manage your pain then do what you need to do and to hell with them.

I’m on a break from chemo as of a month and a half ago because my last scans came back NED. 

But within the last couple weeks, I’ve been experiencing chest pain, coughing, loss of appetite, and really bad shortness of breath. My oncologist didn’t take any steps to rule out the cancer coming back, just told me to go to the ER. There, they misdiagnosed me with pneumonia. I took antibiotics for over a week and it didn’t get better. I went back the other day and they did a CT scan — found a big growth in a lung and another growth in my chest. 

Now my oncologist has moved up my next PET scan to evaluate these growths, but it’s not for another week. 

This isn’t the first time that I’ve suspected a health issue was cancer-related and been blown off by my doctors only to later find that it was cancer. 

I’m afraid I won’t make it to the next scan, much less whatever treatment options there might be. I can’t walk a few steps without getting out of breath. I’ve had no appetite. I can barely sleep. 

I have an appointment with my oncologist on Monday (god forbid a medical emergency happens over the weekend) and I’m going to request an end-of-life drug. I know the process can take a couple weeks, and I want to have an out just in case my situation gets even more painful.

My mom is in her last stage of pancreatic cancer, and is currently in the hospital managing pain until we figure out hospice. We’re trying to decide if it’d be best for her to be at home or in a facility. 

So far she needs help standing, going to the bathroom, showering, and eating. Due to pain killers she has difficulty understanding what we’re saying and her sentences don’t always make sense. There are also times where she gets upset or confused and says things over and over. At first she told us she wanted to be in a facility, but then she wanted to be home. I don’t know what she wants anymore.

My dad thinks it’s best for her to be at home. Originally I agreed, but now I’m not sure. Im going to be at work all day, and my dad is older and experiences some memory loss. I’m just worried my dad won’t be able to care for her fully. I know I’ll become mentally and physically exhausted trying to do work and help my dying mom at the same time. I love her so much and I want to do what’s best, and I feel like I’m giving up by wanting her to be in a facility. But if she’s in a facility, she’ll be cared for 24/7 by a trained nursing staff.
However, if she’s back at home she might feel more comfortable in her own room. My dog would be able to sleep beside her too, they’re practically joined to the hip.

“A terminal illness is an illness or condition which cannot be cured and is likely to lead to someone's death.”

When I spoke to a palliative care physician and asked what I would call myself, he said I am terminally ill because I have the disease that’s most likely going to kill me, Unless some other dire health issue comes up or I accidentally step in front of a bus. I have stage four metastatic melanoma and there is no cure. So medically, I am considered terminally ill. 

There is no timeframe attached to that. It has nothing to do with the six months or five years or anything like that.

The reason I say this is because once you have had cancer you will always be at some risk of it metastasizing, even years after treatment has been completed. There is no doctor who will 100% guarantee it will never come back. 

There is: 

NED- No Evidence of Disease - this is what everyone calls ""cancer free"".  This is typically used in early stage (0-3) and late stage (stage 4) cancer, once treatment is complete or in the case of stage 4 once active chemo is completed along with rads/surgery if used. This simply means ""we can no longer detect cancer in your body.""

NEAD- No Evidence of Active Disease - typically used with us stage 4ers. This is achieved once active chemo is completed along with rads/surgery. It means ""We can still see or detect mets but they are no longer active (essentially dead mets)"". 

There are SOME exceptions to stage 4 being terminal as it is not necessarily used in some types of cancers the same way as with cancers like breast, cervical, colon cancers. But ultimately yes stage 4 is a life ending stage as there is no cure once cancer metastasizes. All treatment moves from a curative process to a palliative process with the goal of extending life. 

I know I sound cold or callous, I am really sorry for that but I do think it is important that people understand and use the correct terminology. Sugar coating does no one any good. 

I personally have been NEAD for almost the entirety of my diagnosis. I was diagnosed initially with stage 2B breast cancer 5 yrs ago. Just 4 months into chemo and my mets were found on a CT scan. I finished chemo and immediately started antibody therapy along with a bone strengthening drug.  That was in feb 2018 and I am still on that same line of treatment with zero progression. 

If one looks at the stats they need to understand a few things. 

1. All stats are pretty outdated. It takes years to collect and compile them and by the time they are released they are already well outdated.

2. Stats do not take into account the advancements that have been made after they have been released and most released stats are usually a few years old already. 

3. Cancer treatment has become very personalized. They no longer throw everything at it and hope it works. It is pretty fine tuned and even the methods of detecting cancer has gotten better. 

4. And if stat collection for other types of cancer is anything like breast cancer, The way metastasises are tracked is very very poorly done. Infact unless you are diagnosed metastatic de novo (stage 4 right at diagnosis), your metastatic progression is never included in stage 4 stats. So for example myself. I was stage 2B so when I die, my stats will be collected as a stage 2B death even though stage 2 is not deadly, I will never be included in the stage 4 stats. That is because they do not change your initial staging and progression stats are poorly tracked and recorded. I know it is stupid and there are groups trying to get this changed. 

Because of the advancements people are living much much longer. I am still considered an outlier and I will still most likely die from breast cancer but I have very much out lived the the average life span of 18-32 months at stage 4 and with each year that passes I have a greater chance of seeing my children into adulthood.",t3_z5mw2p,t1_iy0idf1,2022-11-27 20:44:48,/r/cancer/comments/z5mw2p/daughter_of_stage_4_colon_cancer_50f_i_have_a/iy0idf1/,r/cancer,,

1. If your dad has a Palliative Care team, they can assist you by assigning you a social worker to help you with this. If he didn't have a Palliative Care team, ask his Oncologist about it. 

2. You can try contacting your local Department of Aging or Senior Services to see if they can help.

3. You can try contacting the local health department and request a social worker to assist.

4. Maybe instead of Medicare, see if your dad qualifies for state insurance instead of Medicare or maybe a combination of both Medicare and Medicaid, if possible. Speak with a social worker about this option.

I'm not claiming that any of those will solve your problems, but it's more options for you to consider &amp; try. You never know, they may be able to help. Don't give up.

It’s been a heck of a year with him and I am currently his caregiver. Prior to his diagnosis he had 5 TIAs (minor strokes). We have been through the ringer and adjusting to treatment with his cancer dx. So far it’s finally going well. His cancer has done amazing after many bumps in the road. His tumor has shrunk to the size of a prune and he’s finally feeling well. We are even close to getting his pleurx drain out and down to draining every 3 weeks. The problem is the medication he is on is thousands of dollars and now just NOW we have a problem with insurance. I get it, I work in healthcare and even deal with insurance so I can understand most of it.He’s supposed to change to a Medicare plan this week too since he’s now retired but I have been through rep after rep and I can’t get help in answering any questions about his chemo med coverage. How older people navigate Medicare is beyond me!? I am so fed up I could possibly cry. I have been through plans, pharmacies, reps, countless people and companies and no help! No one can actually help in navigating the cost of this literally life saving medication. So here is the medication we need to keep someone alive and no one is willing to help with it!? I am just needing to vent and probably throw a bit of a fit before I get back at it. I just can’t understand how our system makes sense. They want 4k just for a one month copay this month with his current private insurance! Now I’m supposed to pick a random health insurance plan to fit his needs but no one can actually break anything down aside from basic copays and tiers. It’s so frustrating! It just feels like every time we get in a good place it’s another mountain to climb. I’ve been working with the pharmacy on a grant but that won’t come in time for his next dose. We just want to survive without going broke, I don’t know why that’s so much to ask for. To ya know live, get treatment, and still be able to eat while doing it.

EtonRd,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_z83ncc,25,iy9ludu,"I’m very sorry for what you and your husband are going through. I think there’s a confusion about what palliative care is. You need to speak to your husbands doctors and understand more about what’s going on.

Palliative care means getting care that improves your quality of life. It could be pain management. It could be help with nutrition. It can help manage other side effects. The thing to understand is that it isn’t always replacing care from oncologists. It can be in conjunction with it. It’s not a step before hospice. But a lot of people get confused because when someone enters hospice care, they work with a palliative care physician. But you can start working with a palliative care physician the day you are diagnosed with cancer. 

The question to ask the doctors is what is the next step in treatment? I understand that he’s going to get another surgery, but what treatment are they doing systemically to treat the cancer that is throughout his body? Once you find out what the treatment plan is, you can ask about that treatment and what the stats are in terms of how long it will work for. It’s not the same as a prognosis but they can tell you that on average it works for a year or on average it works for three years, it can give you some sense of where things are.

I have seen a palliative care physician for the past three years, to help with pain management. You don’t want to “beat” palliative care. It can be a part of a treatment plan for years before somebody transitions to hospice. Can you talk to the palliative care physician and ask what specifically they will be helping your husband with? And maybe get those scans re-taken with your husband sedated so they can know for sure where the cancer is.

fishymcswims,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_z83ncc,3,iybbeh8,"Speaking as someone who has worked in palliative care, it’s a service that people can receive at any point along the trajectory for a serious or life-threatening illness - at the time of diagnosis even.  True, it can eventually transition into hospice, which is what end-of-life care is and generally involves more services available to a patient and their caregiver/family.  Hospice is generally when a person has an estimated 6 months or less expectancy, but prognostication isn’t an exact science, so patients have been on it for years on occasion, or even discharged when if the condition doesn’t appear to be terminal anymore.  Palliative care can involve symptom management such as pain and nausea, appetite and GI-related issues and so on.  One difference between palliative/hospice symptom management and other providers is that the services often have more time to talk things through with patients in regards to goals-of-care and decision-making.  It can be a heavy field to work in at times, but it’s an honor.

I can’t speak for other countries, but unfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons providers in the U.S. often don’t involve palliative care (or hospice for that matter) until there are no longer any life-saving or -prolonging options left, sometimes within 72 hours or less of a person’s end-of-life.

You, on the other hand, were very rude in your response to them. No need to tell someone to ""shut up"". If you didn't like their comment. You you can choose not to answer them or choose to down vote their comment or just ignore it altogether and wait for others to comment.

I'm sorry you didn't like what they said, but your reply was a bit out of line. Most of us try very hard to be mindful of our responses in here due to the sensitivity of the issue of having cancer or dealing with someone who has/had it. 

It's certainly normal to worry or have anxiety about cancer returning at any moment, whether you're the patient or the caregiver of someone diagnosed, so I get where you're coming from with that and you have a right to express your feelings here, but attacking someone that's just trying to help explain something to you, isn't really fair, is it? 🤷🏽‍♀️

Keep in mind that while we're certainly here to support each other, we're not expert therapists or something and we can't be expected to alleviate your anxiety and you're not always going to get the comments you want or expect. However, we can suggest that you speak with your boyfriend's Oncologist about maybe getting some support from a Palliative Care nurse who can set you up with a social worker and maybe even a therapist or in-person support group to help you with your anxiety regarding your bf's condition. 

There is also the group here in Reddit called r/leukemia you can get into to get more specialized support for your situation, too. 

I'm sorry you're dealing with this and we do our best to help each other, so please be aware that we're not here to try to be mean or disrespectful in any way. 🙂

Things to ask such as, what are the different treatment options to pursue, how long she might have left based on current staging, what will they do to manage her pain &amp; other side effects of treatment, will they assign her a Palliative Care team to her, etc.

Lastly, I think you need to be sure your mom gets her affairs in order now, rather than wait for later. Get an end of life plan together. Make sure there is a medical power of attorney set up for when your mom is no longer capable of making medical decisions, set up a financial power of attorney so that her bank accounts, etc can be handled after her passing,  see an estate attorney for getting both a living will and after death will together, find out what her final wishes would be and follow her requests.

The most terrifying part is when it spreads to distant parts of the body.  And nothing can be done.

Has your mom been referred to palliative care by her oncologist?  Palliative care is designed specifically to make the patient as comfortable as possible and manage all symptoms.  They also focus on patients other needs including emotional, spiritual and practical.  They are a great resource.  They should be able to help her with panic attacks and other symptoms to the extent possible.  And might have some resources to help her cope with blindness.  And mental health issues.

I imagine that your mom is terrified of being left to fend for herself while blind.  She needs a dedicated caregiver.  

Also, only your mom can decide if she wants to continue to fight the cancer or just be made as comfortable as possible until the end and have hospice care.  I don’t know if you live in a “right to die” state or not, but at some point that is something to consider as the suffering reaches a certain point.

This sounds like a hard road for your mom, but you can help make sure that she gets the care she needs.

She is obviously in severe emotional distress, you’ve described that she’s been to the ER twice for emotional issues. That’s not giving up!!!  that’s being in severe emotional distress and utterly traumatized.

Your mom should be referred to a palliative care doctor immediately who can talk to her about what she really wants, in a calm and supportive manner. No judgment. Talk through the options of more chemo, or whether she wants to forgo more treatment and receive only comfort care until she dies. They can also help her or refer her to a therapist to deal with her anxiety and depression. There’s also medication she can take to deal with those things. Palliative care will focus on having her life be more comfortable, regardless of whether or not she decides to get further treatment.

I don’t think you should tell your mother what you want her to do and how you feel. As much as you love her, this isnt about you.

They give you a phone number so if you do indeed get a grapefruit sized b-hole (my dude can measure his own anus but not grok what his IV bag says?) or the more typical mouth sores…they can help you.

18mather66,t5_2qixx,cancer,t3_zk6fe8,4,j00if9j,"Thinking of you - this a challenging, heartbreaking period for sure. 

Once it was clear my dad’s treatments were no longer improving his quality of life, we shifted to palliative care. He was on it maybe a week and a half before we shifted to hospice.

The only reason we didn’t go straight to hospice is the stigma of hospice and feeling that we were “giving up.” I knew better, too, as I used to secure grants for hospice programs at the hospital where I worked and knew the breadth and depth of services hospice offers. 

As promised - hospice was fantastic - he was able to improve a bit with the focus on quality of life and face his inevitable decline with tremendous support from a really empathetic care team that he trusted and had shared his preferences with re: end of life. 

I wanted to share that story because the earlier you enroll someone in hospice, the more agency they’ll have over their palliative care and end of life. If you enroll them closer to the end, there’s a good chance you’re making decisions for them. Which is stressful and can make you feel out of your depth.

They can provide spiritual care, art/music therapy, massage therapy, home health aides, comfort measures - they can orchestrate a wealth of services and take a lot of burden off the family, allowing you to spend more time focusing on the person instead of just the complications the come with end stage cancer. 

Sending you and her and your whole family strength and peace during this time. 

Another side note - Try to find a nonprofit hospice if there’s one around you, many have been absorbed by venture capital firms due to the reimbursement
model  - and they’ve been known to cut services to ensure a wider profit margin. Either way, there’s likely reviews you can read up on to ensure you choose the right service if you end up enrolling her in hospice.",t3_zk6fe8,t1_j00if9j,2022-12-13 04:42:16,/r/cancer/comments/zk6fe8/is_this_the_end/j00if9j/,r/cancer,Is this “the end”?,"My mom has extensive stage small cell lung cancer with considerable spread throughout her body.

Waxy/greasy skin, but skin is a normal color

Dried mucus around lips

“Lifeless” look in her eyes (hard to describe, but it’s almost like she’s looking past me, or can’t focus on me. Could just be because she’s not wearing her glasses. 🤷‍♀️)

And the time in the hospital they kept increasing her morphine for comfort but she felt like they overdid it and now she wants to wean herself off of such a high daily amount. The reason being is she wants to function and have her mind. She was previously offered a fentanyl patch and declined it. If there are pluses and minuses comparing between fentanyl and morphine. 

If anyone can share anything that can be helpful, I really appreciate it. She has been fighting so hard.

Palliative care is a term used for pain management - at any stage. Is she on hospice with palliative care? Or just pain management ? 

If she is on at-home hospice the doctors/hospital would - in the US at least - send her hospice nurses to check in and perform care regularly.

Even when everything has already been prepared. People are going to deal with their stress and grief in different ways, there's no way around that. It is okay to feel how you do. Just because you are not constantly at the bedside doesn't mean you are experiencing any less grief than your brother and father. 

A few other people mentioned palliative care and/or hospice. Since she is already on palliative care ask to speak with one of the care team to address your concerns. They may have some suggestions or resources.

I would also take the time to talk with your father and brother if you have a good relationship with them. Perhaps a conversation will bring about some ideas to make things more comfortable for everyone involved. 

Also, I want you to know, your life is more than ""the shit son who just plays video games and does jack shit."" Your life began with your mother.

If you're an independent contractor, you don't have an employer because you're your own boss and on 1099 from each place you perform work. If you're getting a W-2 from a company at the end of the year, the you're an employee and not an independent contractor. That's first. 

Secondly, if you're an independent contractor, you should have your own LT disability insurance that you're paying for each month already and I'm guessing you don't. If you're an employee of a company who completed a W-9, you can file for disability through your HR department at work, but keep in mind that check will be about 60% of your normal earnings.. and that's if your employer offers LTD, whether they pay for it or you do out of each paycheck. 

You can also try filling for SSDI through the Social Security Administration. That will involve your Oncologist agreeing with the disability and helping you complete the process. You must fill out the forms and gather records as well.

Truly, there's a lot to unpack here because we don't really have much details. Certain conditions must be met. Your best bet is start at your employer's HR Dept. Then speak to your Oncologist about getting you set up with Palliative care who can assist with possibly providing a social worker who can help you navigate through this better. You can also contact Social Security directly.

So, Palliative care focuses on quality of life, decreased suffering, and pain and symptom management alongside any curative and life prolonging measures.  So, a stage IV breast cancer patient can get palliative care while having chemo and radiation.   Once those curative measures stop, then usually hospice takes over.  So hospice is palliative care *instead of* chemo and radiation.

Now, there are always exceptions.  Sometimes a patient will get palliative radiation to help decrease pain while on hospice.  And some patients on palliative care never transition to hospice.  But the focus of palliative care is to live the best possible life for the longest time. 

Hospice, in my opinion, is unfairly stigmatized. I see it as a supportive service for people to keep them pain and symptom free, have the best quality of life, and keep the family supported while someone either isn’t or can’t get chemotherapy or radiation.

She had a good quality of life for the first few years of her diagnosis, but there was a point where continuing treatment without a doubt made things harder and more uncomfortable for her. I don’t think she would have done if any other way - it was her personality to “fight” until the end. 

It’s possible with all the information your mother has been given that she believes she will be most comfortable with minimal/palliative treatment. Everyone decides on their own path. 

No matter what it is challenging to care for someone you love as they die. This will be difficult. 

I viewed it as my job to fill my time with her with joy, and facilitate anything I could that would make her happy/more comfortable/feel loved. I tried to be her logical and practical cheerleader. I cried at home where she could not see, and I saved my tearful “I love you and thank you for being in my life” for the end. But again, everyone does things differently and there may be different expectations in your culture that I can’t account for. 

I hope you find balance and peace with the situation.",t3_feat1k,,2020-03-06 15:28:54,/r/breastcancer/comments/feat1k/mom_was_diagnosed/fjnj6cx/,r/breastcancer,,

I too have metastatic breast cancer. Most people don't know what this means. 

Metastatic breast cancer is also known as Stage 4, secondary, late stage, advanced or terminal.  I was diagnosed at 36 yrs old initially early stage 2B invasive ductal carcinoma ER/PR negative, Her2 positive,  but 4 months later in between chemo cycles 4 and 5 I have a ct scan for back and neck pain and they found my mets on my vertebrae. I am now in month 32 of my breast cancer diagnosis and month 28 of the metastatic diagnosis. I am still on my 1st line of treatment after completing 6 cycles of chemo, unilateral mastectomy and opted not to have radiation. 

As someone else said the stats are inaccurate, for several reasons. View them more as a guide rather than an absolute.  It takes years to gather the stats and compile them and so they tend to be about 5 yrs or older. Also the way stage 4 (aka metastatic de novo) and metastatic (initially diagnosed early stage 1-3) deaths are recorded (even though they medically are the same thing, statically they are recorded differently) are skewed due to the fact that they do not change your staging from the initial diagnosis. 


We all know the 1 in 8 stat. That 1 out of every 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives. 

What most don't know is that for every 10 breast cancer patients 3 will end up with a metastatic diagnosis. This can happen at any point after diagnosis right from the very initial diagnosis to even 20 yrs after completing treatment and doctors have no way to know who will end up with a metastatic diagnosis. 

There are lots of options for pain management and don't be afraid to ask to meet with the palliative care team, they are there to help your wife with pain management and to guide her in her options for living as good a quality of life as possible. Palliative care does not mean end of life care. Research shows that the earlier palliative care gets involved the better quality of life for the patient. 

Some of the options for pain management range from physio therapy to medication to radiation and at times surgery. 

I personally have been on the same line of treatment for the past 28 months. Eventually this line will fail, the cancer will become resistant and then we will move onto the next line of treatment and so on until I no longer have options. This for some take mere months and for others years. Again no one has anyway of predicting how anyone will react to a treatment.

Your wife can live a decent quality of life with the right supports and treatments/medications. Don't be afraid to use narcotic pain meds if she needs them. If one is careful with their usage and using as prescribed they can make a world of difference in quality of life. 

I suggest you look for some online support groups specific to your wife's type of cancer and make some local connections if possible. You are going to find that some people in your lives are going to pull away. They may also try to use your wife's diagnosis to garner sympathy for themselves. One of the things I did when I was diagnosed was make a set of rules for myself and others regarding my diagnosis. 

1.No one outside of my home is to hug or kiss me as I am immunocompromised. 

2. I will always be as honest as possible to myself and others about my illness and how it impacts me and my family (I am married and have 2 little boys).

3. I will not sugar coat anything so if you ask me how I am doing, expect the truth. If I am having a shit day I won't smile and pretend, I will say it is a shit day. 

4. Do not expect me to console you about MY cancer. You can have your feelings about it but do not voice them to me. The only ones I have a responsibility to in regards to emotional support surrounding my illness is my kids and my husband. I don't even consol my own parents, they are adults and they have siblings and friends they can get this from.  

I have had people say to me ""mindy you don't know how hard this is for us. It is breaking our hearts."" My reply is to then say back ""really? I don't? Because I do believe I am the one who is sick. I am the one who has nightmares that have me waking up screaming and crying in the middle of the night. I am the one who has to suffer the treatments and surgeries and have to wake up every day knowing that I will be leaving my children and there is not a damn thing I can do about it."" 

As for your doctor releasing info, I would be very upset with this, what they did was break HIPAA laws. They shouldn't be sharing any info with anyone expect your wife, not even with you unless she gives the ok to do so.

Please feel free to contact me if you need to chat or have questions. I wish your wife well and that treatment goes easy on her.",t3_hvou0x,,2020-07-22 16:34:05,/r/breastcancer/comments/hvou0x/the_whole_situation_so_far/fyvxfvo/,r/breastcancer,The whole situation so far ..,[deleted]

She was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and she managed to have mastectomy done while it was on stage 3c. Doctor said the breast cancer might re occur and so she gave us hormone therapy, in the form of letrozole. She said that due to her old age, it is recommended that we skip chemotherapy and so we did. I'm pretty sure that was a very bad decision now, at this point. Just 6 months after surgery, we saw a lump at the surgery site. Doctor confirmed it to be a breast cancer recurrence. Her medication was changed to Tamoxifen but it wasn't really effective as her lump kept growing. Her treatment was then changed to radiotherapy alongside injections of fulvestrant. Soon after, we saw some small lumps on her stomach area. The biopsy confirmed it to be cancer but the profile has changed and it is now only 2% hormone receptive. The oncologist therefore said that her only possible treatment at this point is chemotherapy and so we discussed about it. I myself though that we should at least try out the chemo and perhaps immunotherapy as well. The oncologist on the otherhand will not allow chemotherapy to be done on my grandmother saying she is too old and it might worsen her dementia. My grandmother also has diabetes. I'm going to see another doctor for a second opinion but is it really best to not even attempt chemotherapy on my grandmother?  I'm not very sure and any advice will really help. Without chemotherapy she really isn't really receiving any form of treatment due to the new tumors not being hormone receptive, I think. Any help and advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Forgot to mention the cancer has spread to her hip bones which I think is what's causing her a lot of pain when she tries to sit up. She also has stroke on her right side, also her surgery site.

It's really hard on you, literally breaking down your healthy cells in addition to the cancer.

It sounds like the other options were not working now so they have decided it might be worth it now since the cancer is progressing. I'm really sorry she and your family are going through this. It's a really hard decision to see if treatment that might extend a life but decrease quality of life is worth it. 87 is a good long life even without a cancer diagnosis.

My name is Mindy, I'm 39 and mom to 2 boys (both have adhd, one is on the autism spectrum and the other has a speech disorder) and I too have terminal breast cancer. I was diagnosed early stage oct 2017 and 4 months into chemo they found mets on my vertebrae (feb 2018).  I have been living with MBC for 33+ months now.

There isn't much I can say to ease how you are feeling right now. Just know there are others in this sub who gets what you are dealing with. We each have our own way of coping with being in this situation. I know right now it feels like everything is flipped upside down and like you are living in a nightmare, this feeling will ease eventually and you will find away to live a life while dying. 

You have options for treatments and pain management. Ask to speak with palliative care (not the same as hospice with is end of life care). Palliative care is there to help you live the best quality life as possible. They can help with pain management and what your options are going forward.  There is no shame in needing pain meds, there is a difference between addiction and dependency and need. Don't be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself. 

Radiation of the mets may be an option to help with pain from those problem mets, this is something to discuss with your oncologist. 

Ask to speak with a social worker as well, they can help you with finding funding, disability programs and other supportive measures. 

If you want to talk please reach out to me, also there is a sub reddit specific to stage 4 cancers, I believe it is r/stage4cancer.

From the beginning we told our 6 year old exactly what was happening, that mom was sick and was going to be okay but needed lots of rest, was going to lose her hair but was just as beautiful, everything he needed to know but in the best way a 6 year old could comprehend it.

My 6 year old has been a champ with the exception of a few outbursts. Before school started, my wife sent an email to his 1st grade teacher that she was sick and how it was affecting our son. 

I take a lot of time to take care of my wife, to make sure she is comfortable and be an emotional support, doing housework, cooking. My wife's sister lives with us part time to help us with our kids, which we really appreciate since she is also a college kid and a big help and our kids adore her.

My son does the hybrid school schedule. Last week I got a call that he had a meltdown and needed to go home. He was so upset, all he wanted was his mom to comfort him.

It's not fair to these kids. They should be able to play and run around with their mom and dad, my son shouldn't have to cry at school because his mom is sick. He shouldn't have to spend so much time away from his mother while she is in bed or at an oncology appointment.

I’m 40. I have a mutated gene they call CHEK2. That came as a shock since no one on either side of my family has even had breast cancer, at least up to my great grandparents. I caught it super early so doctors said I probably would have to have hormone therapy to keep it all at bay, but no radiation or chemo. 
Due to COVID and whatever else, I just had my bilateral mastectomy this last Monday. They took my sentinel lymph node for biopsy and the doc told my hubby that the node looked to be normal, soft and mobile. I’ve been doing amazing, I was up and moving about an hour after my surgery, the pain has been minimal, I was scared to see myself in the mirror, but that turned out okay as well, better than okay actually, making jokes about letting my freedom ladies fly and looking like a tough warrior. I was having super positive thoughts and thinking yes this is over!! 
2020/Cancer decided I needed to rethink everything I was so happy about. I called to get the biopsy results on Thursday. The lymph node is cancerous. I spoke with the nurse so I have no idea what this is looking like, how cancerous it actually was, etc. my follow up is next Friday, in the mean time the doc will meet with my oncologist and a tumor board to decide what happens next. And in the mean time my mind is a jumble of shit that doesn’t slow down. But I am hanging on to the hope that it was isolated to the sentinel lymph node and didn’t have a chance to spread at all. Or if it did since I caught it early and it isn’t a super aggressive cancer that maybe it’ll only have spread to the surrounding lymph nodes. 
I have 2 little boys, 7 and 9 (almost 10). I have now entered a fight for my life that I wasn’t anticipating. I refuse to let this fucker take me from my family. It’s not going to happen. I will NOT let it!!!

I apologise if I'm not using any of the correct terminology I live abroad and haven't been present throughout her BC journey. 

I'm pretty much gutted I don't know what this means really, from what my family has told me, which isn't much  (I didn't want to bombard her with questions and havent had the chance to properly talk to my family since we live apart) she will most likely be passing away soon. 

This terrifies me because I haven't lived in my home country for over six years and have barely spent any time with my family in almost two years due to covid restrictions at the beginning of this year. 

By the way things have been explained to me I will not be able to make it home to see her before she dies. I simply can't afford it and it would take me about three weeks to travel with quarantine and then also risking making her sicker just to say goodbye, it's out of the question for the time being and I can't miss three weeks off work.

My question to you guys is simply, how do I say goodbye? I don't have any statistics or explanation on how long she's got, I assume it varies from person to person but is there any chance she'll hang on for a few months? She's only 62 and in good spirits but I also assume that without treatment this aggressive cancer will continue to spread fast and that we're simply out of time.

If you're grade 3, and young, I'd do absolutely everything the doctors recommended. Even the with best statistics and lowest grade recurrence is a gamble. Stack your odds as high as possible while you're able to or you'll regret it later.

Talk to your doctor about your side effects. You shouldn't have to ""think"" you might have atrophic vaginitis, that should be something you bring to them and they can definitively diagnose it so they can prescribe palliative treatment for your impairing side-affects.

metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t1_gkekis4,34,gkexalk,"First, I am sorry you are a part of the MBC community. I was diagnosed at 36 initially stage 2b 4 months into chemo they found mets on my vertebrae, so stage 4. I am now 39 and in August I will be 40. I have been stable for the past 3 yrs.

As for explaining to those who insist you will beat this, the best way I found to approach this is to be frank with them. That once cancer goes stage 4 all treatment is of a palliative nature. 

Metastasis can be confusing for many. I found the best analogy is this:

Imagine you walk into your kitchen, you turn on the light and you see a couple cockroaches (cancer) scurry under the fridge. You call the exterminator and you fumigate (chemo) your home. You hope that the fumigation killed all the cockroaches. What you don't see is all the microscopic eggs hidden in the walls (bones), the cracks of the floor (liver), in your ceiling tiles (brain), in the motor of the fridge (lungs). All the places that the fumigation couldn't reach. You go a period of time not seeing cockroaches anymore and so you assume the fumigation did it's job and then one day you walk into your kitchen and you see a cockroach scurry under the stove. You think ""how is this possible? I followed all the instructions. I took all the right steps.""  Well cancer just like cockroaches are masters at hiding. Their eggs (cells) can lay dormant for years until the conditions are just right and they hatch and start growing again. 

Chemo is effective. It works and for many they never experience progression but for approximately 30% of all early stage breast cancer cases they do and this can happen during and after treatment is completed even 20 yrs down the road. It isn't anything you did wrong. Doctors and researchers themselves still don't truly understand the mechanism of metastasis, they have theories but they have yet to find the actual key to this. No amount of positive thinking, praying or eating a special diet is going to change the fact you have a life altering and life ending illness. Treatment helps, it gives you more time earthside. Only you can decide how much and for how long you want to endure treatment and what kind of quality of life you will want going forward. 

Be honest with those who are saying things like ""you can beat this"" tell them how it makes you feel. That it is dismissive of your feelings and the very real an unfortunate situation that has been thrust upon you. 

Set some rules of engagement as well for those around you. I found that setting rules really took a lot of the pressure off of me but also off my loved ones as well. I also used the ring theory to help me decide where each person in my life falls in regards to whether they are a part of my immediate inner circle. 

My rules are:

1. Honesty. I will be as honest as possible about the realities of my illness. The treatments and my options. If you ask me how I am doing, I won't lie if I am having a shitty day I will tell you. 


2. No seeking comfort from me unless you are my kids and husband. I am already dealing with my own emotions and mental well being. I have limited reserves and I refuse to give more of myself than I have too. This even applies to my own parents. I am not responsible for how YOU feel about MY illness.


3. If you don't like the way I am choose to approach my illness, how I speak about it (I have a lot of dark humor). If you are uncomfortable with the things I say, then I suggest you take a break from my life and get right with yourself. 

4. Status Quo. Talk to me like you did BEFORE you knew I had stage 4 breast cancer. I want to hear about your shitty day, the terrible date you went on. I want you to ask me for advice or tell me a stupid joke. If you have a question about my illness, treatment etc just ask. I am more than happy to share. 

One of the things I did right away was make a facebook group specific to my life with cancer. I have an extremely large family (last count we were in the 100s, this is aunts, uncles, 1st and 2nd cousins that I have contact with regularly) and so calling or emailing every person or even just the aunts and uncles would be really time consuming and exhausting. 

I use the group to update everyone on what is happening not only with treatments but my life in general. I use it as a diary and sometimes I just write to vent and other times I share important and educational info.  It is also a way to control the information about cancer life. People know that if it isn't on the page and I haven't told you directly then it isn't true. They also know that if they message me digging for more info that they won't get it. I share what I want and nothing more.

metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_ljq7bb,8,gngyc6y,"Hi. First I want to say My thoughts are with you. No one deserves to get this diagnosis. 

As for whether you still have cancer after a lumpectomy only the doctor can answer that. Even then they can not tell you that you are 100% cancer free and any doctor who does say ""you are now cancer free"" is a doctor who is sugar coating the situation. 

The truth of the matter is that for early stage breast cancer diagnosis there is approximately a 30% chance of metastatic disease happening at some point in the patient's life, even years after treatment has been completed. 

A local recurrence (so new tumor growth with in the breast tissue) is also a possibility but it is not as detrimental as a distant recurrence (metastatic disease in distant parts of the body such as bones, liver, lungs and brain). 

When cancer become metastatic then all treatments are of a palliative nature, so think more time and trying to decrease cancer load but not with a cure in mind. 

I hope this clears it up. My advice, learn the early signs of metastasis. Make sure your GP is also familiar with the early signs of metastatic disease as well (you would be surprised how many GPs miss these early signs until cancer load is obvious).  Try not to let fear dictate your life, I myself have been living with metastatic breast cancer for 3 yrs, and I lost a good year of my life to the fear and emotional distress. I still struggle from time to time but I am trying to figure out who I am now and I am enjoying my time as much as possible.

It ties up services for those of us who actually have legitimate pain and symptoms and it discredits us everytime someone fakes a symptom. 

I was diagnosed early stage and 4 months into treatment mets were found on my spine. They were found because I had lower back pain and an increase in blood calcium levels that prompted a ct scan.  My point, metastasis can happen at ANY point even during treatment. I am now 3+ yrs into my diagnosis and was getting scans every 3 months, now every 6 months due to stability. 

If even half of my fellow breast cancer patients were to fake symptoms for scans I would be forced to wait for my much needed scans because of the over flow of patients. 

For those early stagers they need to learn the early symptoms of metastatic spread and they need to make sure their general practitioners know the symptoms as well.  By the way when it comes to MBC there is no ""catching it early"". Once it goes metastatic all treatment becomes palliative not curative.

They just found metastasis on my pelvis and spine and in the lymph nodes under my pectoral muscle. If I had it to do over again, I’d make up aches and pains to compel my oncologist to order scans just so I could catch it earlier and change meds sooner for a better outcome. Where to make up the aches and pains? Breast cancer most often metastasizes to the pelvis, spine, liver, lungs, and brain. Pretend you have a persistent cough. Say your lower back hurts. You’re getting headaches and double vision. Idk but don’t be complacent because even if it’s early stage, there’s a 30% chance that it will metastasize."

With early stage breast cancer approximately 30-33% of cases end up turning metastatic and 100% of untreated cases end up metastatic. Metastatic breast cancer is not curable and is palliative. 

I was diagnosed oct 2017 with stage 2B IDC intermediate grade Her2+ HR -. I was 36.

4 months (feb 2018) into chemo they found mets on my spine and said I was probably de novo but the mets were initially too small to be picked up until chemo caused them to calcify. 

I did 6 cycles of chemo (3 FEC 3 Docetaxol) and have been receiving herceptin every 21 days and zometa every 3 months since feb 2018. I also had a unilateral modified radical mastectomy. I opted to not do radiation. 

Here is my reasoning... 

Cancer is like cockroaches. You walk into the kitchen and flip on the light and see one or two scurry under the fridge, what you don't see is the 100s-1000s of cockroaches and their eggs hiding in the walls, the floor cracks, under the stove in the motor of the fridge etc. You call the exterminator and they fumigate (chemo) your house. The hope is that by bombing the system you get those hidden buggers that are not detected by sight. 

Chemo works. Yes it sucks but for the most part the side effects are temporary and those that are not are mostly manageable.  If they told me tomorrow I needed chemo I would not hesitate to say yes to it. 

If I could do one thing different I would Not have surgery. I have long lasting side effects from the mastectomy. Lymphedema, I also was left with a very large ""dog ear"" under my arm that resembled a B cup breast in my arm pit. The surgeon went in a year later and removed it and now I have the opposite issue a large caved in area that makes it almost impossible to wear a bra as the band now rolls up and settles into the scar and then the area swells. I also can not lay on the side anymore than a few minutes and have shoulder pain all the time. 

I opted not to get radiation because I seen no point. It wasn't going to change my prognosis in any significant way and radiation is only a risk reducer for local recurrence it does Not prevent local recurrence and does not stop metastasis from forming anywhere else in the body. Also once an area has been radiated it can never be radiated again. So if I did radiation then had a recurrence in that spot my only option would be more chemo and further surgery which means removing the muscle of the chest wall. My medical oncologist was not happy with this decision but the radiation oncologist agreed with my choice not to radiate. And 3+ yrs in I have no regrets. 

Herceptin took me about a year to get use to and now the side effects tend to be pretty mild with some flu like symptoms the day of and a few days after.

Zometa sucks balls in general but again the side effects only last a couple days.",t3_nb2t9x,t1_gxxj906,2021-05-13 02:05:16,/r/breastcancer/comments/nb2t9x/are_there_resources_for_people_that_dont_want_to/gxxj906/,,Are there resources for people that don't want to pursue chemo/radiation?,[deleted]

Breast cancer can and does metastasize long before diagnosis is even made. 10% of all new breast cancer cases are metastatic de novo (stage 4 from the start).

There also does not need to be a palatable lump for metastasis to happen. Infact in some women their primary breast tumors are never found, they are diagnosed by biospy of a met that was accidently found during other procedures. 

There is no such thing as ""Cancer Free"" once you have had cancer. This is because cancer cells can ""hide"" in places that chemo may not reach. So while you may have No Evidence of Disease and go the rest of your life this way, there is no guarantee you will remain this way. 

Stage 4 is also known as Metastatic, secondary, advanced, end stage or terminal. There is no cure. 

Stage 4 means spending the rest of your life getting scanned, treated and scanned again. We call it the treat scan and repeat. 

Stage 4 treatments are never of a curative nature they are solely palliative. We use treatments to buy us more time. There is always a trade off though. You may get more time but you may also end up with secondary cancers from chemo and radiation or heart or kidney failure from chemo and targeted drugs. There are physical, mental and emotional trade offs as well. You have to accept that there will be decreases in your quality of life. 

Palliative is not the same as hospice. Palliative is the caring of those with life ending illnesses and providing care and treatment that eases pain and decreases symptoms. One does not need to be actively dying to be palliative and research is showing us that when palliative care becomes involved early in a stage 4 diagnosis the patient experiences a better quality of life. 

Hospice is the care provided to those actively dying. Who no longer have treatment options or no longer want to pursue treatment options. Hospice is the guidance and caring to death. 

Finally. We patients do not in any way shape or form control how our cancer behaves. We can not will treatments to work. No amount of smiling or positivity will change a cancer diagnosis or prognosis.

I said NO and kicked them out of the ICU room.  I have always been a firm believer that the mind rules the body.  If I see myself healthy and well then my body reacts.  I took control and decided to do nothing aggressive. I have been on Herceptin/Projeta and Amerdix for 18 months.  Recently the CT showed minimal advancement.

You were right to support your mom. At the end of the day she made a choice and she was comfortable with that choice. 

Contrary to what some may claim, even in this sub and even by some other MBC people, stage 4 aka metastatic breast cancer CAN NOT be cured, even with conventional treatments such as chemo, radiation and surgery. 

The best we can hope for at this point is longevity by way of palliative chemotherapy, targeted treatments, radiation and surgery.  For some, like myself, we hit the cancer lottery and we get very long periods of stability before a treatment stops working and for others the treatment results maybe short lived or never work at all. There is really no way to know who will fall into which category.  I have been stable the entire 3.5+ years but I know of women who were diagnosed the same year and type as I who died just months after diagnosis and others who are very close to the ends of their lives. 

I am betting your mom knew the extent of her disease. For her to be able to take that and make a decision to opt out of conventional treatments and to just live her best life while she could is amazing and admirable. Not because she bucked the system but because she stayed true to herself. Everyone has their own idea of what a good or great quality of life is. 

What you can do for your mom now is ensure she is getting the best care possible. Have a frank and honest discussion with her about her expectations going forward. Have her write out her wants and needs regarding hospice and end of life care. Advanced medical directives come into play here. What does she want medically if she loses consciousness? Does she want a GI tube to assist with feeding? What about pain medication? Depending where you live medical assistance in death may be an option she might want to consider. These are all things your dad, you and her medical team need to know to ensure her wishes going forward are met. She also needs to know that it is ok if she changes her mind on some things. It is ok if she decided to try treatments. But she also needs to know that no matter what she decides you will be there supporting and loving her.

metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_osqv14,13,h6qja7v,"I would guess that it depends on where you live and whether insurance requires it in order for the other treatments to be covered, but ultimately your body, your choice. 

I live in Canada and so we have absolute freedom to decide whether or not to follow a doctor's recommendation without fear of retaliation from the medical center or medical team. 

I opted out of radiation. My oncologist was pissed. I told him that I understood the risks and that it is my choice. Admittedly our medical relationship was never the same after that and so around 2 urs into my diagnosis I fired him and switched to another oncologist in the same oncology clinic. 

A few things you need to consider. 

1. What does the pathology report from the mastectomy show? Is it a complete response or are the margins not clear?  

For me despite having stage 4 breast cancer, I had a complete pathological response in the breast and lymph nodes from chemo. My oncologist and radiation oncologist both stated they had not seen results like mine in many years and there was no evidence I actually had cancer other than the clips left behind from the biopsy, not even scaring from the many tumors I had. 

2. Have you had a consult with a radiation oncologist? What is their recommendation? Did they give you risk of local recurrence stats?

My radiation oncologist was very thorough. She knew I was on the fence about radiation. The fact I am stage 4 made my decision a lot easier as I already knew I wasn't willing to give up anymore time to cancer than I already had and I was not willing to give up would could have been my last summer with my kids. 

She was very frank with me in that there are no stats on how many people end up with local recurrence after opting out of radiation. This is because most people follow the trifecta of treatment (chemo, surgery, radiation). Opting out is just not common. She figured my risk of local recurrence would be about 10-20% higher compared to someone early stage who did not have a complete response to chemo. 

3. Do you understand the function of radiation and how it differs from chemo? 

This is something that most patients don't really understand or know. There is a huge difference in their function and why they are used. 

Chemotherapy is like carpet bombing. It is systemic. It travels through out most of the body and gets into all the nooks and crannies. 

Radiation is targeted treatment. Meaning it only has an impact on the area it is aimed at and the surrounding tissues. So if they are radiating the breast it has no impact on cancer that maybe growing else where for example in the thigh bone. 

Radiation is also a one and done. Once an area has gone through a series of radiation, that area can never be radiated again. So if local recurrence does happen despite radiation, you no longer have that as a treatment option. Radiation can and does also cause tissue damage and so if local recurrence does happen and you need surgery, you may end up losing more tissue/muscle than necessary. 

Radiation is not a preventive treatment although it is touted as such. ""Radiation prevents local recurrence."" No. No it doesn't. It only reduces the risk of local recurrence. It can also be used palliatively for painful or problematic mets for stage 4. 

Radiation also will not prevent nor has an impact on metastatic spread.

I am now 3.5+ years into my stage 4 diagnosis. I completed chemo in march 2018 and surgery april 2018. I have had clean mammograms ever since and do not regret opting out of radiation. 

At the end of the day you need to ask yourself. If I opt out and x# of months/years from now I have a local recurrence, will I be ok with the choice I made to opt out?  Do I understand why radiation is done? 

Also keep in mind that you also have the freedom to start radiation and stop it if you feel it is to much for you. Just because you start a treatment it does not mean you have to finish a treatment.",t3_osqv14,t1_h6qja7v,2021-07-27 18:36:03,/r/breastcancer/comments/osqv14/do_i_have_to_do_what_the_doctors_recommend/h6qja7v/,r/breastcancer,Do I have to do what the doctors recommend?,"
I just had a double mastectomy after receiving adjuvant chemo. I did 4 rounds AC and 5 rounds Taxol. I was supposed to have 12 of Taxol but I thought the tumor was growing and a sonogram confirmed it was. 

Surgery was scheduled almost right away. I am now 4 days post op. I’ve already been told I will likely do xeloda pills for some time after but it was just dropped on me that radiation is a possibility. 

I am totally opposed to radiation at this point and I wonder do I even have a say in this? Is there an appropriate way to express this to my oncologist?

Apart from the cancerous tumor that was removed the pathology report came back clear. No lymph node involvement, nothing in other breast, and nothing in the surrounding tissue of the tumor. 

Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated. Thank you!!"
metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t1_h7h8gtt,6,h7hbsro,"Here is the thing. Once you have had cancer you will always be at risk of metastasis. There is no such thing as ""cancer free"" or ""cured"". Sure there are doctors who use the terms but I think that comes from a place of not wanting to upset patients or make them feel hopeless. 

The risk of metastasis changes depending on the type of cancer and it's sub type and it's drivers (example hormones and her2).  For some cancers the risk is so low it could be considered non existent and then for others such as breast cancer the risk can be quite high. Like I said previously approximately 30% of all early stage breast cancer cases will end up progressing to stage 4 and this progression can happen at any point, including although rare during active chemo and in some case it could just months after completing treatment or it could be many many years. I have spoken with some women who developed stage 4 20 yrs after their initial early stage diagnosis and treatment was completed.  

Unfortunately one of the reasons people tend to not hear of these stats is because of the way breast cancer cases and stages are recorded in north america and the uk.  Metastatic spread after early stage diagnosis is actually not reported for SEER reports. We get grouped into the early stage we initially were diagnosed with statistics. So when you look at the stats they are skewed.  So for example lets say we look at the death rate stats of  someone with IDC stage 2B and it says 2% have died of stage 2b IDC. Well that isn't exactly true because one can not die of stage 2b breast cancer. That 2% is actually those who initially were stage 2 but progressed to stage 4 and died. 

And when I say one can not die of stage 2 breast cancer I mean it. It is because at that point the cancer is contained to the breast and the breast does not contain anything necessary for life.  But once it starts spreading to other organs it is just a matter of time before it overwhelms the body. This is why all stage 4 treatments are palliative in nature. Once spread starts there currently is no way to stop it entirely, we can only slow it down. 

So I was originally stage 2b so my death will be recorded as stage 2b with distant metastatic disease.",t3_owiu19,t1_h7hbsro,2021-08-02 22:09:20,/r/breastcancer/comments/owiu19/im_starting_a_community_that_helps_spread/h7hbsro/,r/breastcancer,,

One is in the back on a rib and the other near the aorta in mid chest and unable to biopsy either. Second opinion with a top radiologist believes early stage 4 but also not clear.

Our current situation is:

A. Treat as stage 3 aggressively. But the oncologists said outcomes and life span aren't as good if it's actually stage 4 and you burn your body out with all the aggressive treatments up front since it'll just spread again.

B. Treat as stage 4 starting with hormone blockers. Only using chemo as needed and rotating through medicines over the next few years. Hope that a stage 4 trial comes a long that applies.

C. Treat as stage 3 with ispy2 trial (or similar national trial) with standard chemo + AC, radiation, surgery route but a bonus breast cancer drug that is shown to work well in other cancer settings and matched to her cancer subtype.

D. Wait 3-8 weeks for more biopsy results, chest node surgery and results, genetics to all come back then decide a,b,c. The road we're currently on.

We're waiting to speak with a cardio thoracic team to use a robot to biopsy the chest node, which is in a dangerous spot. There's also an ICD involved that needs to be removed which adds a couple more week wait after surgery. Suggesting Lupron while we wait.

My wife and I are of the opinion that she's a strong fighter and young enough that the hormones and wait stage 4 route is dumb. That we should start chemo immediately and go after it aggressively and see what happens. We feel much more pressure timeline wise if we're on the cusp for 3 to 4. We have an amazing marriage a 1yo and a 4yo and this is fucking it all up. It's like the worse dream we could conjure up.

How about you don't say anything about the people who are dying or have died from cancer since that's never a situation you've experienced? Especially when you're saying it so self-righteously.

Honestly every single comment you've made in these threads is so condescending and self-important I have to say something for those who are here but too tired to.

The truth is- You've got no skin in the fatal cancer game right now. You want to get real? That's it.  Don't tell stage 4 cancer patients about clinical trials. People here have been through multiple. Don't tell dying people ""you're not less, you fought"" as they are dying while you simultaneously promote ra-ra soldier language that helps no one. Uh duh, they know they're not less and they don't need your permission to know it.

""Why do we have to ""tear"" each other down""?! Because no one wants to hear you endlessly pout over 2 threads about how awful it is no one wants to join in the warrior/solider/battle language that you're using to the objections of actual dying patients from the comfort and safety of someone with an actual future. It's extremely easy think of this as some gallant knight's quest when you've yet to see or experience the brutal reality that is unique to terminal cancer.

And valid criticism of your behavior and that fact that other people disagree with your opinions shouldn't be taken as ""tearing someone down"". This isn't high school, grown ups should be able to take critique without thinking it's a personal attack on them. Healthy disagreement is perfectly fine. Adding the victimization element with that line is quite manipulative. And in a fricking cancer sub no less! Spoken to active patients while you're cancer free?! OH COME ON! Call me crazy but I take far more issue with you trying to shout down dissenting, more relevant voices with the ""we're all part of team cancer"" routine when people have very valid concerns about your statements than worrying about some fictitious notion all cancer patients have to be supportive of each other or else they're the problem not the person causing drama in the first place and then continuing it with a second freaking individual post. That's just completely out of line. It's borderline emotional blackmail. This is not the place for you to work out issues or try to marginalize people who don't agree with you blindly. This is not a place for you to bully peers with your toxic positivity or nothing mentality. Remember- you're the one who spoke out originally in your comment, you opened yourself up to criticism and differing views by your participation. No one dragged you into this but you. Lashing out at people- people in active treatment, terminal people- because you weren't received universally positively is completely uncalled for.

Take a step back and consider for one second: you no longer are battling cancer by your admission but are here lobbing accusations and getting snappy at actual cancer patients and making this all about you.

Everything is all focused on your opinion in this post and your original comments on the other post. You're centering this entire issue on you (what you think, *""what can* ***I*** *say?!""*, what you take offense of when other commenters speak their piece, this entire rebuttal- nobody needs your rebuttal, you're a random anonymous internet person not the spokeswoman for cancer, not a famous person who needs to control PR), and frankly your overall general rudeness isn't welcome to people dying of this shit. You seem to have some serious main character syndrome everything you've commented on this has been all ""me, me, me"". That's extremely inappropriate when you're no longer affected and haven't experienced the illness in question. Stage 4 terminal cancer quite simply is a whole different ball game than what any other stage. It's especially inappropriate too when you did so in such an immature manner. ""REPORTED AND BLOCKED!"" Is that how you contribute so much to the women diagnosed after you? Is that ""how you're here for people""? Is that you yourself practicing your extremely loaded and preachy words of ""can we make our points without disrespecting and minimizing people's experiences?"" Geez, thanks. How helpful, respectful, and supportive of you!

The fact is- Unless you've been given the terminal stage 4 metastatic diagnosis, sit the debate on what the patients prefer out.

There's a saying- never miss a good opportunity to shut up. You and everyone else really need to take that advice on this matter unless you've been there yourself. Sit this one out.

Until you're stage 4, until your tumors are ulcerating through your skin to the point they become open wounds you have bleeding for YEARS, until the cancer has eaten into your bones so much you can no longer stand and support your own weight with your met riddled spine, until you're getting blood transfusions on a semi-regular basis because constant infection, until you have to spend half a decade on palliative chemo, immunotherapies, and radiation just to continue living, until you've been on more tamoxifen than your doctor has ever given any patient, tried half a dozen different chemos and just as many immunotherapies just to watch them all fail, you don't know enough to speak on this! You can't even imagine the experience. So don't try to comment on their preferences.

Stage 4 cancer is not a battle it's the blitzkrieg and patients aren't soldiers, they're innocent civilians taking shelter while being bombed incessantly, simply seeing how long they can last before their body finally breaks down from it.

There is no fight. People dying of cancer aren't fucking warriors. They're just people who just want to be left alone by this thing. This isn't glamorous and romantic, warrior princess battling to the end stuff.

It's the life slowly draining from your body as you try to gasp and reach to keep your head above the waves. Until one day the wave is too big.

Soldiers have a choice and voluntarily engage in a fight. Stage 4 patients don't and only engage in survival. The last thing they want to be are soldiers fighting a battle.

You clearly don't have experience with it talking the way you do. Terminal cancer isn't badass warriors shit, it's the saddest fucking thing a patient can experience and those around them will ever see.

Just kept this in mind going forward. Maybe you'll finally learn something from this. No rebuttal post needed here too.

They went through clinical trials for experimental drugs so that we could have better options. THEY LITERALLY RISKED THEIR LIVES so we might survive. Sounds like a fucking warrior to me.

I genuinely do not want to offend anyone. I'm sorry if I did.

metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_tucvlp,38,i33cino,"Initially diagnosed oct 2017 with invasive ductal carcinoma stage 2B intermediate grade. Her2+, ER/PR-.  I was 36 yrs old. 

Nov 2017- March 2018Did 3 cycles of FEC. 3 cycles of Docetaxol. Had a complete pathological response to chemo.

April 2018 Unilateral left side modified radical mastectomy 

Opted not to have radiation. 

Feb 2018 Bone mets found on CT scan after I complained of a sore back and neck and had a sudden increase in blood calcium.  Mets were located on vertebrae T2, T6, T11.  Chemo caused these mets to calcify. 

Started Herceptin and Zometa Feb 2018 and have been on them for the past 4 yrs.

Generally I am doing well and have had zero progression in 4 yrs. I do have joint and muscle pain through out my body. We assume it is from  the chemo and targeted treatments.  I deal with a ton of brain fog to the point I quit driving (backing into my MIL's brand new car one evening solidified that for me). I am tired a lot and extremely unreliable due to fatigue and the general feeling of being unwell and so I no longer work, which for some may sound great but it is really isolating. It seems the only time I leave my house is for medical appointments. But I get to be with my kids and raise them with their dad, my husband. I am grateful to have no progression and to be able to mostly care for myself. I have a great support system especially with my husband. 

I was never given a timeline on life expectancy. In fact my original oncologist just out right refused to talk about it and would repeat ""Mindy you are fine and healthy. You will be here many years.""  I fired him last year because I felt he wasn't listening to my concerns and was being extremely dismissive. If I got upset about anything at all he would state that I need therapy and then compare me to his other patients.  I used to get printed copies of everything in my health records and in one of his consults to my family doctor he advised her that my estimated lifespan would be 5-7 yrs. I have now used up 4 of those years.   Others in my situation consider this a chronic condition. I however can not see it like that, it is ultimately a terminal illness and unless something else kills me first cancer is my death sentence. I am ok with this, I made peace with this very quickly. There is power in acceptance. I say this because initially I was extremely emotional, fearful and angry. I wasted so much of my precious time crying and staying in bed feeling sorry for myself that I knew it wasn't sustainable and nor was it fair to myself or my family. It took months of hard work and self reflection and what I finally found helped me was to sit down and write out my advanced medical directives and make a plan for end of life care. I live in Canada and so we have access to medical assistance in dying and so I met with them and had all my questions answered. I also met with palliative care who really helped me feel at ease with my situation. They answered the questions my oncologist refused to answer and they reassured me that their role was quality of life vs my oncologist's stance of quantity of life.  I feel that because I was able to let go of the anger and fear and make peace with my fate that I have been a happier more present mom and wife. Now that's not to say I don't have bad days. I do, frequently but I am much more capable of recognizing those days, giving the fear, anger and sadness the space it needs and then I get on with it. 

I have a lot in my life to be grateful for. If I get to see my children off into adulthood I will be able to die knowing that I served my purpose and that they will all be fine.",t3_tucvlp,t1_i33cino,2022-04-02 10:13:40,/r/breastcancer/comments/tucvlp/stage_4_roll_call/i33cino/,r/breastcancer,Stage 4 roll call,"Can we have a roll call for all stage 4 MBC patients/caregivers?

Looking at those numbers another way: that's roughly the entire population of the city of Buffalo, NY. It's nothing to sneeze at although we think of that number as being small, it's a lot of women in all reality. 

That 3% absolutely happens. As the child (who also happens to be in medicine) of a patient who had even lower odds (2%), didn't take all the treatment avenues available to them when it was stage 1, and is now dying of stage 4 cancer recurrence 10 years later, I'd implore you stay on the doctor recommended treatment. Exhaust every opportunity you have to stop this now while it's still treatable.

In the long term, despite the discomfort, you're not going to regret the things you did to safeguard yourself. You will however absolutely regret the things you didn't do if your number is one of those 200,000 in the future.  

Plus if you think your quality of life is bad now, you don't want to damn yourself to the agony of stage 4 cancer. 

I'd suggest asking your doctor to refer you to a palliative care specialist as least for a consultation.

After 6 or 8 moths of not knowing what the heck was going on with me until I started to read y'all comments I had my A-ha moment and I said "" Aleluya"" I am not going crazy and its not just me :), Of course they gave me antidepressants but I still can see how my Quality of Life was down hill fast. After a serious conversation with my Onco she said to take a 2 weeks break and to reduce dosage from 20 to 10mg and then we can go from there.. The 2 weeks break ended to be almost 2 months and I also quit taking the antidepressants. I have never feel this good before, but on the back of my head I can't stop thinking ""The what if gets back ?"" I started the 10 mg dosage and I can see already that slowly all the same aches and pains are coming back Agh. I just turned 49 and refuse to go back to the same road of low quality of life, but I don't think I can forgive myself if that bitch come back again. I keep asking myself if is worth it to go to hell again for another 4 years with Tamoxifen for just a 3% of possibility is the $64K dollar question.

neonstarseed,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_ujh6r6,5,i7jedxv,"No, not particularly. This is a pretty common wait time nowadays. Even pre-pandemic there was a wait of several weeks in most cases because you have to be fully evaluated and prepared for surgery. There are several appointments to get done. Blood work, consultations, in certain patients a cardio check-up, etc. The right personnel have to be available too. And since COVID there are longer wait times, things have been backed up. 

It's unlikely your cancer would grow significantly in that time, especially if they've mentioned it's slow growing. But if you would like to ask for an earlier appointment, or better yet direct these questions to your doctors so they can specifically reassure too there's no harm in trying and I would encourage to do so to put your mind at ease. 

Things just don't move that fast unless you have a particularly fast moving, aggressive form of cancer. IBC, triple negative, metastatic, etc. In long-term palliative chemo patients it's not uncommon to even give them a rest from treatment for a few months every 12-18 months to recover if they are stable because there's minimal danger and the body needs to recuperate from side effects.

Well, I'm a terminal bc patient (hormone pos, HR2neg, bone mets) and I feel like I have NOBODY anymore. So here comes my little rant.

Cancer took **EVERYTHING** from me!! My energy, my ability to drive (due to medication) my intelligence (same!), my bravery (I'm PTSDing hard as soon as I come near a hospital), my sanity (I keep forgetting everything), my hopes, my dreams, my joy for life, my hair, my friends, being able to enjoy time with my loved ones, every hobby I ever had I can't do anymore (thanks to neuropathy, pain, loss of energy). 

And now, after first being diagnosed in 11/19 and again in 08/20, I found out that my PALB2 gene is mutated. **They tested it already in 2019 and all was fine**. How is this even possible?? Now they re-did the test because they found the PALB2 mutated in my boy's genes (it was checked because **he had a f\*\*\*\* lymphoma 2 years ago when he was only 11**). It came back positive too. So now, my life is cut even shorter and I'm NOT READY for that!!  
I have 5-7 more years **at best**. And I didn't even hit 40 yet. WHAT ABOUT MY HOPES AND DREAMS AND MY WILL TO LIVE?? Why does nobody give a sh\*\* about that?   
Everything is about me doing everything the docs say, everything for the kids so that they don't feel like mommy is sick. In reality, I'm not really able to eat anymore. I switched most of my diet to drinks (a nutritionist who's a specialist for cancer patients helped me with that- it makes everything way easier &lt;3). Like I mentioned- I have basically no more friends, because after 3 years, they were just gone one by one. I understand - who wants to talk about cancer, treatments and dying? Who wants to go out with someone who's tired all the time? Also, I don't want to have to act like everything is okay and I don't wanna hear that nasty sugar-coated **""You'll see, everything is going to be just fine!""** anymore. It's **NOT.** And there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not angry because I have cancer, I'm not questioning ""why me"" or whatever. I'm angry because everybody seems to leave me ""on time"" not having to be there when it gets really ugly.

Is there anyone out there who I can connect with? It doesn't seem like it after my rant- but I'm a genuinely nice person (an ENFP personality type), lol."
metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t1_ia39w61,16,ia3ofu6,"Chemo didn't necessarily save my life but I am alive because of it and my 1st line antibody therapy I receive every 21 days for the past 4+ yrs. I have stage 4 breast cancer which means it has spread to other organs in my body,in my case my bones. I have been stable since my mets were found in feb 2018 but they were only found BECAUSE of chemo. They were too small to be picked up on the staging ct scan initially, but chemo caused the spots to all calcify which made them visible on the next ct scan I had 4 months into chemo.  They typically do not do a follow up scan when one completes chemo, usually it is done 6 months to a year after treatment ends, if it gets done at all.  I was having back and neck pain and had a sudden spike in blood calcium levels which is why I ended up having a ct scan while I was still receiving chemo. If that hadn't of happened I most likely would have had severe metastatic progression in the months following and quite possibly would be dead by now. 

Here is the thing that most people are not going to bring up because no one wants to be ""that person"", but because I am not a ""survivor"" or an early stage breast cancer patient but rather a late stage breast cancer patient and I have a vastly different view on treatment and quantity of life vs quality of life, I am going to say this. 

Your gran is 87. She maybe, if she is lucky, has between 5-10 yrs of lifespan left, unless she turns out to be one of those rare people who live past 100. All the treatment options are going to have a significant impact on her quality of life. My suggestion, sit down with her and have a frank discussion on what she considers a good quality of life and what her limits would be. Personally i would do chemo first and then have scans to see how affective it was before doing any kind of surgery (also consider the risks of surgery itself such as anesthesia, bleeding issues etc). 

I don't think doing nothing is the right way to go with this for a couple of reasons. 1. She is experiencing pain, chemo can help with this. 2. If the tumours continue to grow there is a good chance it will erupt through the skin causing ulcers and putting her at significant risk of infection. 

I think as a society we need to get away from doing the absolute most to extend life over protecting the quality of life when we are already at a point that our length of life left is minimal, obviously the final treatment decision should always be up to the patient and all options should always be presented but along with all the options for treatment we should also be provided with palliative care options (comfort care, pain management, protection of quality of life) so that the patient can truly make an informed choice. Maybe I feel this way because of my diagnosis and prognosis and I have had an oncologist try and force me into a treatment I didn't want nor seen any value in (I opted out of radiation) and it seriously angered the oncologist to the point I felt he did just the bare minimum for me which forced me to fire him.

KnotDedYeti,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t1_ibc9nm3,3,ibdrq2s,"Both my grandmother and mother had their BC spread to the bone marrow. This is correct, once spread to the marrow and spinal fluid it's pretty impossible to reverse. The length of time left varies greatly however. My grandmother lived another year, my mother only 6 weeks. Going through this with them, and in the years I've now spent as a patient advocate have shown me that the most important thing to focus on at this stage is quality of life. A good Palliative Care doctor can make a world of difference here. I also believe a focus on their comfort and quality of care - a good medical and familial support system - can extend their time in some instances. Hospice is not ""giving up""!! It's changing the focus to the comfort care and the happiness of the patient. Getting hospice on board too late is a mistake I see happen far too often, because people wrongly think it's a negative thing. It is not that, it can improve both the patients and their families lives in many ways. Every now and then miracles do happen - a terminal condition improves. My husband's grandmother received excellent hospice care for end stage COPD. She improved way beyond what was thought possible. After 6 months her hospice nurse came to us and said, ""it's my great pleasure to fire you from hospice care. We believe you've improved to the point where you are in no immediate danger of dying, so we refer you back to regular patient care."" She lived another 7 years. So listen to her and her doctors, seek out medical care that can keep her comfortable and happy. The old adage to prepare for the worst and hope for the best  is sage advice indeed. I'm so very sorry this is where y'all are, I know it's unspeakably difficult. Focus on her, assure her that you and the people she loves are Fine - she's given you wonderful lives and now you want to make hers the best it can be. That's what's important to all us moms, that our families are and will remain well and happy, now and when we're gone.",t3_v5lasl,t1_ibdrq2s,2022-06-06 16:26:30,/r/breastcancer/comments/v5lasl/doctors_are_recommending_no_further_treatment/ibdrq2s/,r/breastcancer,,

If, however, you're talking about it just really being hard to recover from, that's where oncologists are prepared to help with various medications and strategies. She was prescribed this chemo because it presumably offers the most survival benefit for her specific cancer, so the real question in that case is how she can get through it. Generally the first dose of a new chemo is the most worrisome because it's new to us and we don't know how it's going to affect us or what we need to do to help with its effects. Based upon talking with her, though, her oncologists may change some of the supporting drugs or measures she receives with her chemo dose as well as what she does at home afterward. That can make a big difference! 

Another resource, if it's available to her, is a palliative care specialist. Most major cancer centers have someone who offers this. We tend to confuse this with hospice care, but in fact it's help at all stages of cancer specifically to make us more comfortable.

I’m sure you have told it many times so I appreciate you taking time to retell it. This is a forum for support, so if there’s any place for you to whine this is it!!! 😉

I cant even imagine how difficult it was to navigate this nightmare in the height of COVID times. You deserve a medal just for that. I wouldn’t look at choosing to have the surgery as your biggest mistake. I’m sure you had guidance from doctors and you were doing what you thought was best for your body. There was no way you could’ve known it would become so complicated. No one could know that!!

You may already be doing this or have already gotten this suggestion, but have been connected with a palliative care or pain mgmt doctor? You’ve been through so much, you can at least be a little more comfortable! They don’t just prescribe narcotics, they have lots of resources to help patients manage pain. I am actually an oncology nurse and I’ve seen people who’ve struggled with pain for years get some relief when these folks get on board. I know you weren’t asking for a suggestion but I just wanted to throw it out there for you. 💜

I’m not going to tell you not to feel depressed about your the way your body looks. You have absolutely every right to feel that way. Our doctors are so focused on treating the disease and keeping us alive, but when it’s all over we have to deal with the aftermath of scars that never go away. I hope in time you are able to look at yourself and those scars and think of them as battle wounds and that you survived a literal war. But only when you are ready to feel that way 💕

And this goes without saying, but FUCK that ex husband. Sounds like he got exactly what he deserved!! My partner that I was with during my first diagnosis/treatment left me after I completed everything. Cheated on me with a coworker. I’m pretty sure that was going on for a while before he finally grew the balls to leave me, but I’ll never know. And it doesn’t even matter, if I’ve learned anything from this shit disease it’s that life is wayyy too short to spend any time with people who do not 100% love you and support you.

 My understanding is that my oncologist will probably never give up...there is always more chemo that might eke out a few more months. At some point my organs will start failing and that will be it.

I'm going to be the one to give up when the 'treatment' side effects outweigh the few extra months gained. I'm not there yet. 

What I won't tolerate is pain. And you shouldn't have to either.

 My GP knows my cancer is ultimately terminal and she works with me to find the right pain meds and plenty of them. I've also just had another dose of radiation for pain. This is all palliative rather than curative.

There were brutal treatments (chemo, extreme surgery) that may have ultimately been ineffective. Medical care for cancer has changed significantly int he past few decades, but what she has seen older women experience may be the motivation for her current refusal to accept medical intervention. 

Especially if she is Indian, you can try peer pressure. Find one or more Indian women who are breast cancer survivors. They will be able to address her concerns (""how bad do you think Tamoxifen is? I am here talking to you today, and I took it this morning. Don't I look happy?"") Especially, they will be able to apply ""guilt"":  ""Your daughter needs you, your grandchildren need you.""

It sounds like she is willing to do ""natural"" medicine.  There is some evidence for high dose vitamin C, administered by IV. It could possibly slow the growth, but there is no expectation of a ""cure"".  There is also a little bit of evidence for tumeric.  https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2020/yun-cantley-vitamin-c

Does she have hormone receptor positive breast cancer?If yes, there is a possibility that the growth rate of here cancer could be *slowed* with low-intervention medication options - none of these are chemotherapy.  Assuming you can talk her into it. ""Would you be willing to take this tiny pill, to see if it can help you be more comfortable?""  At some point she will need opiod pain medications. The joint pain side effects of aromatase inhibitors will be much less than the pain of uncontrolled metastases.

1) Aromatase inhibitors prevent the body from making estrogen, which the tumors probably need to grow. They won't cure her cancer, but they could make her more comfortable, as they could slow the growth rate. With aromatase inhibitors, there is a choice between letrozole, anastrozole, and exememestane. Exememestane has the fastest onset, but also faster side effects. Anastrozole has a very gentle onset (it took me 2.5 months to get significant side effects) but might not be fast enough to help her. If you can get her to see *any* doctor, you should be able to get her an Rx for exememestane.  Compliance is an issue - it is one tiny pill a day, so you won't know if she is taking it or not unless you are able to supervise her.  

2) Tamoxifen could be very helpful, but many women find the side effects to be significant. (Depression, hot flashes, mood swings, and more) The cost is about $10 a month. 

3) Faslodex - an injection once a month. The reported side effects include ""sweat smelling like motor oil"" ... BUT there is a chance it could slow the growth of her cancer. Because it is done at the doctor's office, you would not have the same concern about compliance that you would have about a pill. 

If you can talk her into seeing a palliative care doctor, they may be able to address her concerns about medications to slow the growth of the cancer. 

Regarding time frame of survival, it is really very hard to guess, even for oncologists. A friend had unsuccessful chemo for an aggressive lung cancer, and did not end up trying additional rounds or types of chemo. The chemo ended in January, he was on opioid pain meds by early May, and passed away in June.  He was hospitalized for about 3 weeks total over the last 2 months.

RA, heritable peripheral neuropathy, atherosclerosis, carotid stenosis, ulnar nerve impingement, etc., etc. BC was an incidental finding. I had no symptoms of cancer. No mammogram, but breast exam by doctor and self-exams have never turned up any lumps. Low-dose lung cancer screenings are negative.

I have had a problem with dizziness and balance issues for several years. My vision sucks, and I have had a partial vision loss in my left eye for over 20 years. I am on a 6-month cataract check. Progressive lenses are not making this any easier. 

I had a nasty fall a few months ago that put me in the hospital. Got up in a hurry to get to the bathroom--because I waited until the last minute, of course!--did the necessary 180 to get out of bed and out the door, got dizzy, and fell. I landed with my ribs on the arm of an old metal arm chair. The pain was ungodly. Worst pain I've ever experienced. Breathing was painful. I could not get up off the floor because my knees---even after the recent synvisc injections--are so painful. I have both OA and RA in both knees. 

My son took me to the ER, which is how I ended up with the BC diagnosis. The ED decided that I had fallen because of a stroke. My right hand would not work properly because of the ulnar nerve impingement. They called an oncologist consult, who ordered a bone scan and blood work. The blood work was normal. The bone scan showed 2 hot spots, so we did a biopsy. The pathology report came back as metastatic adenocarcinoma with almost 100% ER+. The oncologist recommended AI and chemo. Letrozole sounded okay at first, but chemo did not make sense to me, so I refused. They set it up anyway. I had to be very firm about the refusal. The response was, ""Oh, we didn't realize that you were refusing ORAL chemo. We thought that you just didn't want needles."" The pressure was very strong to start the AI immediately, so I did.

Dizziness was much worse with the first pill. I also have pulsatile tinnitus, which means that I can hear my heartbeat, It's always strong and regular, although I usually only hear it at night. After a couple of days, it started to be very fast and irregular. I stopped taking it. Then I read the reviews of people who are taking it and decided that at my age, and with my comorbidities, I would be crazy to take this or any other treatment. The pressure from the oncologist and my children has been terrible. My youngest child is 35, so I have no young children to consider. 

Am I crazy to say, ""Just leave me alone!"""

It comes in waves. It’s almost like I black out, but usually my emotions get the best of me. I usually end up in either a screaming or crying fit. It’s like every 6-12 hours. My doctor said to take clonopin for now. It’s been so bad that all my therapists/psychiatrists have seen it.

I had mental health issues beforehand, but I have been going through so much that I probably have a new ptsd as well.

Background: my parents wanted me to see the doctor they chose. They would NOT let me choose. I’m an assault survivor and wanted a woman doctor. I ended up standing my ground. Hence that led my parents to suing me for guardianship. They tried to get my husband out of the picture. They think he’s evil. He’s the only one that has stuck by me. They cost me $10,000+ in lawyer fees.

They said every mean thing they could about me and my family and basically got all my friends and family to hate me. Some stuck by me. I know those are my true friends.

On top of this, I was undergoing chemo which was really hard on me and I had no support. I had a rare, severe, delayed allergic inflammatory reaction to taxol/ketryuda. My doctor said I was in 1% chance for the reaction. 

I was in the hospital 7 times in total. I have a rare genetic illness so it made things more difficult. My parents are using that illness against me and claiming I’m incapacitated when I’m not. I know I’m very smart. I got my bachelors degree while undergoing cancer treatment. I just have parents that screwed me over.

Anyhow, that’s not all. But that’s the bill of my issues. I’m going to write a book about it. I know I need to talk about it because talking about it helps me.

I’m worried about this depression. I have trouble trusting people because of my parents and it’s making the depression worse. I probably need to go inpatient for psych but I can’t because I start radiation in like a week or two. 

I’m on this new medicine called remeron but it will take 3 weeks to kick in.

Anyone else have depression worsen? Any tips for going inpatient with the radiation or what would you do? I feel like I spiral every 6 hours.

Edit: forgot to say I was already on antidepressants beforehand, but have one new medicine added.

I have triple negative breast cancer. I am officially cancer free as of my surgery. I do have the brca gene though."

Given your staging you should be a top priority patient. Not the bottom of triage. You are not a lost cause, you can have many years of good life from treatment still.

metastatic_mindy,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_xcavbd,12,io62yck,"Stage 4 here. Going into my 5th year of treatment (oct 6)

Stage 4 is also known as metastatic breast cancer, secondary breast cancer and is incurable and almost always terminal (I say almost always because MBC patients can and do die from other things while having MBC such as accidents, heart attacks etc).

MBC happens when cancer cells travel from the primary tumour, in this case breast, to distant parts of the body such as bone, brain, liver or lungs, it can spread to the skin and other organs as well.  This spread can happen anytime before, during and after treatment is completed, yes even years later. These tumours are referred to as mets. 

We MBCer are in a constant state of scan, treat and repeat and will be in treatment for the remainder of our lives until we either run out of treatment options, choose to stop treatment, are forced to stop treatment due to the side effects or we simply die. 

It is possible for the cancer itself to ""go to sleep"" or into remission, the technical term for this is NED or NEAD. 

NED is No Evidence of Disease. This is when mets were previously seen but are no longer visible due to positive treatment results. NED is rarely permanent. 

NEAD is No Evidence of Active Disease. This is when the mets are still visible but no longer active, growing or changing. They are essentially dead. NEAD is also rarely permanent (I fall into this category as my mets are still seen but have gon unchanged in the 5 yrs since they were found).

Depending on the type, sub type and drivers (hormone positive, her2 +) MBC patient may have very few lines (options) for treatment or several options for treatment. 

All treatment for MBC is of a palliative nature instead of a curative nature. We may have the same treatment options as early stage but not as aggressively treated as the goal is now quality of life and longevity vs quanity and curing.

Just hoping someone in a similar position or experience can give advice. I am the lone caretaker for my mom (Age 62-Stage 3 Breast Cancer). She finished her 15th and final round of chemo on October 7th, 2022. 

She has no appetite- and refuses to eat anything. Everything is either too sweet, too sour, a metallic or spoiled/rotten taste- this includes broths/soups. She drinks iced water and sips chamomile tea. The last physical meal she ate was on October 9th, 2022 (she had small pieces/bites of bbq pork, bbq chicken breast, mashed potatoes, and I think a potato salad). On Friday (what would have been her final 16th round of chemo) she was too weak- low blood pressure, dehydrated, and her potassium was dangerously low, so they just said hey you completed 15 rounds-ring the bell you're good.

She was given a drip of fluids and electrolytes at her infusion center, as well as a 4-hour potassium drip. It perked her up, but it did NOT bring back her appetite or get her to eat. Last night we spent 6 hours in the ER to get admitted (I had to email her oncologist a few times saying I am at my witts end here, she won't eat, she's very very weak, etc) She's had pretty bad stomach cramping- I think a combination of not eating combined with constant nausea and being nauseous. She was given morphine on an empty stomach- this caused a reaction of really really bad vomiting and nausea that is still not 100% fixed- she's also hooked up on another what looked like a 4 or 6-hour potassium drip plus IV fluids.

If you are 2 weeks post chemo, when did you find yourself 'able to eat' on your own accord? did it ever happen? what were any tips/tricks/whatever that got you to eat? 

\-she refuses any type of cannabis- she flat out refuses to use it, try it, take it whatever.

\-she has Dronabinol- she doesn't like it. She took one on the 9th, and that's why she was able to eat. however, she thinks it 'makes her high'- unsure if she will agree to have this once or twice a day to get her to eat.

\-she will not do milk or milk alternatives as they are 'too sweet'. 

\-she will not do vegetable brother- as it is 'nasty and disgusting'

\-she will not do Pho. I tried. The only soup/broth she previously enjoyed was from Wonton Soup, however she hasn't had any interest in that :( 

I apologize if I sound frustrated- in all honesty, I am. I know she doesn't want to be in the hospital (who does!) but I also am out of my depth here in helping. I've explained all this to her oncologist and RN via email several times. I've mentioned it to her two infusion nurses. I've said this to the social worker via the hospital. I've said it to the attending oncologist. 

I am concerned she'll get her vomiting under control at the hospital, but it still doesn't fix her not wanting or being able to eat. I don't want to go pick her up, to only take her back in 2-4 days because she is refusing to eat. 

Thank you."
SwedishMeataballah,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_y83nxa,36,isyicto,"Part of living with Stage IV is knowing when you are ready to tap out. It can take a long time to figure out where that line is, or you may push it and question it back and forth, but eventually everyone finds the line. For some its based on faith, or prior adverse effects of treatment they don't want to repeat, or a desire for quality of quantity and going out on their terms. For others its about reaching family milestones or objectives before letting go.

If you truly believe you have reached your line, then its your choice if you want to stop treatment and let it go. No one can say differently, and what your doctor is asking is if you want to be referred for palliative care (pain control) with hospice support because without treatment your cancer will get real, quick, and you will need medical support (including drugs) to manage the decline to the end. But at the same time there are lots of treatment options out there, and versions of treatment options, that your oncologist can and should be exploring to improve your quality of life. You cannot live without treatment, but you should be able to find a treatment that works for the life you want to live.

There are plenty of days when I am ready to throw in the towel and get out of the ongoing nightmare, but I cry and get over it and move on. I got a therapist to talk through my anger issues last year and that helped a lot. I got a far better oncologist. I did all those things because of my treatment goals. Yours are different, but you also still have time to explore changes and improvements to your care if you want to keep going.",t3_y83nxa,t1_isyicto,2022-10-19 17:05:11,/r/breastcancer/comments/y83nxa/stage_4_breast_cancer_and_i_stopped_all_treatment/isyicto/,r/breastcancer,Stage 4 breast cancer and I stopped all treatment,"I got diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2019.

jerseycowmom,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_y83nxa,1,it2adsl,"Wow! I don't feel as alone! I hesitated to post about my PET scan. It was not at all fun. The tracer caused dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. severe everything. I only asked for it because a friend who is an EMT persuaded me to. I am do glad that I did!

I am a few weeks short of 73. Severely allergic to both types of contrast media, so MRI and CT have to be without contrast. Breast cancer was an incidental finding. The whole time I have had the feeling that the oncologist was following a protocol. I have the philosophy that just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

I had no symptoms of breast cancer. No lumps. No axillary lymph node pain or swelling. A bone scan had showed 2 hot spots--third rib and neck. The rib biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma. I kept asking where the primary was. No sign of one. Oncologist recommended letrozole. Aside from the fact that I didn't want permanent menopause, I got tachycardia and arrhythmia. The nurse navigator said that it was a good thing that I had already stopped taking it, because it could cause permanent heart damage.  But only 1% of people react to it! Raises hand!

Still bewildered, I kept questioning. I have multiple comorbidities. Rheumatoid arthritis. Idiopathic heritable peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease. I had pre-clampsia with my first pregnancy, which increases the atherosclerosis risk by 700%! But they want me to quit smoking, which would lower the risk by 59%. I've been smoking for over 60 years. It helps with pain, soothes me, and helps me think. That math doesn't work for me!

I am so grateful to the person who posted about the MSK database of herbs and botanicals! They are very careful to say that these are complementary treatments and not alternatives! I am an iconoclast. I am a certified organic farmer. I was organic forever, long before there was certification. I have avoided environmental and agricultural chemicals since 1975. I eat grass-fed, organic meat that I have raised myself. The biggest thing is that whenever I cook, I add mustard, turmeric, ginger, and cayenne, 

The oncologist said that in all probability, I had initially had a small lump in my breast, which metastasized and then resolved on its own. Could that be from the turmeric? I don't know, but the PET scan showed all organs functioning properly. Nothing in breast, lungs, etc. It showed bone marrow edema in L5,6, and 7. But, those are the vertebrae that I fractured in 1991, and never got medical treatment for. They had disintegrated and turned into gravel.  The pieces eventually fused, but they don't exactly get molded into the proper shape.

My oncologist still wants me to try another aromatase inhibitor, chemo, and a bone strengthener. I think he's nuts.  I should take drugs that will give me permanent menopausal symptoms, make me miserable, and might kill me, in the hopes that it will extend my life? No. I know that I will die sometime. And? My children are grown. I won't see my grandchildren grow up. I'm ready. But I'm really glad that I had that PET scan. Palliative care is fine. I don't need to suffer unnecessarily.",t3_y83nxa,t1_it2adsl,2022-10-20 12:48:22,/r/breastcancer/comments/y83nxa/stage_4_breast_cancer_and_i_stopped_all_treatment/it2adsl/,r/breastcancer,Stage 4 breast cancer and I stopped all treatment,"I got diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2019.

You might also have better luck in symptom management by working with a palliative specialist or integrative oncologist.

Just want to start with I have very supportive friends and family, but I think they might be a bit tired of hearing me talk/complain about all of this.

I am currently 4/6 rounds done with chemo and could use a bit of a pep talk. I am starting to really dread my next rounds. Previously before each round I would feel more 'ready' to tackle the next round,  to face it all. Now once or twice a day I get hit with this 'pit in my stomach' feeling of dread knowing what's coming. I go through little bursts of anxiety when I think about my next 2 rounds. 

My side effects have been getting a little bit worse with each round. The steroids that I am on for the first few days of chemo really mess with my emotions, which hits at the same time as the fatigue and nausea. Some days all I do is lay in bed, shower and cry. Sometimes I feel like I am weak, I feel like I am handling this so poorly, so many other people face more challenges than I do and handle it far better. 

 I generally am trying to stay positive but I find that's getting a little bit harder lately. I'm sorry if this feels like a big pity party for myself, but if anyone has any tips on how to handle those feelings of dread I would greatly appreciate it.

Salsifine,t5_2t6dy,breastcancer,t3_ym3904,9,iv1w07g,"Well, stabilized and then got worse, on about that timeline. Numbness, socks-full-of-lava, and much increased pain if I stood still very long. Also, standing still and then taking up walking again (think: walking and waiting at a traffic light, then crossing) made me weak all the way up to mid-thigh.  After about a year I tried acupuncture and while that turned one toe back on, I was maybe too far gone for it to do more. I suspect that anyone hoping for improvement with acupuncture should try it as early on as possible. 

It took me a couple years to find a good integrative doc who suggested stuff that seems to have stopped the advance and stabilized me at a lower pain level. That, plus daily balance exercises after balance retraining at an oncology rehab program has me able to walk on uneven ground or in snow again, and that weird weakness seems to be gone. 

Even though my med onc made me formally re-consent to my fourth and final chemo given as how bad my neuropathy was getting, saying that might make it permanent but that he really felt I needed it for successful tumor kill, both of my med oncs later insisted that chemo neuropathy only lasts ""a few months"" and that I must have some sort of unrelated neurological disorder that I should go see someone about. It's really common for doctors to be in some denial on the damages they cause with treatments, so you might do better, as you pursue treatment, working with family docs, integretives, palliatives, etc. 

And for goodness sake, if you are having trouble walking, see a rehab PT for balance retraining: it's really weird trying to reprogram your brain to use cues you can't even identify, but it does work and it makes a huge difference in being able to live a relatively normal—and safer—life.",t3_ym3904,t1_iv1w07g,2022-11-04 17:34:03,/r/breastcancer/comments/ym3904/neuropathy/iv1w07g/,r/breastcancer,Neuropathy,[deleted]

Some people have pains resolve within a few months of the end of treatment, some in a few years, others have them as a lifelong thing. To some extent, lumping these together because we don't really know their actual cause (or multiple things that got together) just helps make it more difficult to sort out and treat. And, unfortunately, most oncologists are there to treat the tumor, not the rest of us. While some people find help by switching hormone suppressive agent or even the time of day they take it, beyond that, there's not much more an oncologist can do.

Going beyond oncology, though, some people find good help with acupuncture, some with working with an integrative oncologist or palliative oncologist, some with an oncology rehab or PT program. Basically, once you've done what you can to adjust your treatment, it becomes a d-i-y science project of trying out different things because what works for one person may be totally ineffective for another.

For uncontrollable nausea and vomiting there is a drug called 'Olanzapine' - it's an antipsychotic drug that has the benefit of relieving severe nausea in advanced cancer. I had to take this drug during chemo (I was hesitant at first to take it) and it worked very well for me. It's widely prescribed for advanced cancer. It's usually taken before bedtime. You can read about it here: [https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/olanzapine-reduces-nausea-advanced-cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/olanzapine-reduces-nausea-advanced-cancer)

For breakthrough nausea there are 'Zofran Disintegrating Tablets' that melt on your tongue. They help with mild to moderate nausea.

For pain, the pain management team at the hospital should be contacted as they are experts in the field - they can recommend someone on the team or in private practice. Perhaps the oncologist could refer your sister to one. They can prescribe oral medication, patches, or IV medication, although IV medication is usually reserved for the hospital. She can also enter palliative care where they have physicians and nurses that deal with all the symptoms of cancer. In the U.S while you're on palliative care you are allowed to remain in active treatment and still seek a cure - you do not have to give up cancer treatment to be in the program. Palliative care deals with all sorts of chronic illnesses from cancer, to MS, to COPD - they help alleviate symptoms and increase quality of life. They would help in dealing with constipation, nausea, and side effects of medication and treatment. In the U.S. nurses from palliative care can make home visits (not sure if it's the same in Canada).",t3_zpwup6,t1_j0wtg03,2022-12-20 00:22:07,/r/breastcancer/comments/zpwup6/stage_4_34_questions_about_treatment/j0wtg03/,r/breastcancer,Stage 4 - 34: questions about treatment,[deleted]

The other advice I have is two things.  First, you'll always ultimately think woulda, coulda, shoulda, but at some point you have to let them go.

The kids can't come out of school, your wife can't leave her job, but if you have this much guilt and worry, just take time off of your job if you can and go as much as you can. There's one thing that you'll never be able to buy back and that's time.

I'd suggest seeing a grief counsellor about it. They have some really good tips like don't leave anything good or bad unsaid. From my experience, and I really wish I didn't have it, spend as much time as you can. I'd also get an understanding for what that sleeping more and more stage means.

So now my dad is slowly dying back home in Canada, and I'm here. We can't move back, because we are financially committed to being here, and the kids have just finally settled into their new school, not to mention it would massively hurt my wife's career. Moving back home would be professionally &amp; financially crippling. 

I went back home in the fall to see him, and plan on going back soon now that the holidays are over with, but I feel like it's not enough, and I feel helpless right now. We can afford for me to fly home every couple of months. My dad is at the stage where he just sleeps most of the day, and when he's awake he's not in the mood to skype, especially considering the time difference. I basically don't talk with him at all, all of my communication and updates are with my step mother via email, and brother via skype. 

Not really asking for concrete advice I guess, but just wondering if anyone here has gone through the same sort of crisis (not being able to be with your loved ones during their final months), and what got them through it.

Since then, everything has been going downhill. It got extremely bad once he started radiation, he had seizures, couldn't walk or talk properly, and was very confused and disoriented. Shortly after radiation, he got a smidge better. He was able to walk a little more, he regained some strength, and things were looking much more optimistic around this period.

However, only 4-5 weeks after radiation, he urinated himself and appeared to have either a grand mal seizure or a stroke. The hospital never determined what it was, however, they did an MRI and the scans reveal that the tumor grew much larger, about four times its original size since the June scan. He's now paralyzed throughout the right side of his body, his arm is literally limp and he has to move it using his left arm. He cannot walk.

Yesterday, he urinated himself again but today he actually asked for a bucket to pee in, completely aware. He is actually mentally aware for the most part, it's just he cannot verbally communicate what he wants to say. The doctors have told us the Avastin he was put on will most likely not work, and at this rate just to put him in a hospice.

Also they are helpful in minimizing caregiver burnout as you can sometimes stay at the facility until your passing, instead of staying at home for your last moments and increasing your family's stress.",t3_5q895a,,2017-01-27 04:05:28,,,,
BioChemistryStudent,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t1_disa1sm,1,dit1pkf,"I'm so sorry your bother, and your family is going through this :( I'm not religious, but my thoughts go with you. 

Three surgeries in five months is a ton of surgery; but it's good that they are giving him the therapy that he needs. 
Just a couple general science notes here, uh part of the reason the doctors are being so aggressive in terms of chemo and radiation is his age. Adolescents and young adults will tolerate treatment better, and heal faster/better than children, or the elderly. He also has the rest of his life ahead of him, and like my oncologist told me, ""We don't do treatments to make cancer patients, the goal is to give you your life back."" Its.. given me some comfort in my treatment. Your family and him knows how he reacts to most drugs, talk to your doctors if you have any concern that the drugs are too strong. I react strongly to most drugs except pain killers, and I had to fight with my doctors for lower doses of the palliative drugs. 

My day job is as a PhD student, and cancers are something that I think the public has really been poorly informed about. I think it's easier to deal with all of this if you know a little more, and it's less mysterious.  When you're thinking about it, don't treat his 'cancer' as a singular entity; the reality is that a single cancerous tumor is made of millions of cells, that are extremely different from each other in terms of how they became cancerous, and how they work. Comparing one tumor mass to another within the same person, isn't comparing apples with apples unfortunately. This is called 'tumor heterogeneity' and its how different masses react differently. With brain tumors, it's always possible that the tumor will spread down the spine. Your brain and your spine are floating in this liquid called cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid is actually produced by Ependymal cells, the same cell type that ependymomas come from. This fluid flows from the center of your brain, down your spine toward your tailbone where it's absorbed and removed. If any tumor masses are releasing cancer cells, the worry is that they'll float with this fluid down your spine, and get caught on something where they'll set up shop and grow a new tumor. It sucks, but.. its a concern and the MRIs to test for that are boring as shit. 

The side effects you mentioned are pretty normal; I lost most of my hair during the radiation, not the chemo. I took 1.5 years of Temodar with my 30days of radiation (IMRT). I was diagnoses at 21 three years ago, and I still have to resist randomly crying sometimes. I've been diagnosed with depression as the result of a major life event, with a dose of PTSD in there. Coming to grips with your own mortality is not an easy thing to do. I'm assuming your brother is 15ish, he's still growing, developing, and maturing. He needs time, space, and support to come to grips with all of this, and make peace in his own way. Be there for him, and let him know it's OK to talk about this with you, or a counselor if that's easier for him.  Many patients, myself included feel pressured to always be alright. Be strong. Keep a brave face. Be the stolid cancer patient the media always makes out. I think it is important to let him know that you want him to be honest, because you are there to help him. 

General anesthetic is a hell of a drug, and surgery recovery is rough. It might take a month, it might take two months, TV is good, but don't neglect getting up and about, physical activity, mental activity. I listen to audio books extensively since the story helps keep my mind busy, while I can play a game, or take a nap, or something. You recover your abilities by using them, the trick is balancing that use against overuse, and that comes with experience. 

In terms of my treatments: I was diagnosed with an anaplastic ependymoma of the right lateral ventricle, in between the parietal and occipital lobes. I had surgery first since I was admitted through the ER for an extreme migraine, vision loss, and projectile vomiting. After the surgery, we waited seven weeks to start chemo and radiation. I took uh, 350mg of Temodar daily M-F and had radiation M-F for six weeks. After that, a month of recovery, and then Five days of 550mg Temodar + 380mg chloroquine phosphate a month for 18months. I tried using a tumor specific drug for a month, but I am allergic to it, so we stopped that pretty quick, but I might go back on it depending on how this next MRI goes. Three years, three surgeries about 11months apart. :/  
All things considered, I handled that reasonably well. The Radiation sucked, and when you hear about chemobrain they aren't kidding. You can't focus, you feel like you haven't slept in days and it seems like everything is happening at a different speed. Try to stay busy during it, and make sure you eat. I ate Qdoba burritos every day for a month because it was one of the only things I could keep down, and that actually had flavor I could taste. Staying hydrated is extremely important, and if you slack on that, all the symptoms get worse. I diluted apple juice 1:3 with water to give it some flavor and help my guts absorb it. 

Chemo by itself is a whole other beast entirely. Because Ependymomas are so rare, there isn't a universal treatment plan for what to do to treat/cure them. There is a lot of subjectivity in planning treatments, and CERN is really the only research going into them. Because of that, my doctor is following the Stupp 2005  treatment plan for Glioblastomas. Those tumors are worse, so... Hit it hard and hope for the best is my guy's philosophy. Don't be afraid to do your own web searches and see if there is anything new out there. 


Prognosis is something Doctors will either talk about, or they wont. You can find the statistics online pretty easily. MD Anderson has a nice one. The way I optimistically predict it, is that if you make it 5 years, you're out of the woods, but that's just me. 
I really can't tell you at what point life quality isn't worth it, and frankly that is his choice so far as I'm concerned. I filled out a living will, and I've had several candid conversations with my family about what I consider my line in the sand, and as a family we all reached an agreement. If he's less than 18, then it's your mom's choice, but he should still be consulted, and steps taken to take to prevent any future confusion. Your hospital should have a personnel who can help him fill out a living will. It's a morbid conversation, but its necessary. Personally, Mine is structured such that my immediate family never has to make the choice to 'pull the plug' someone or something else makes that choice. 

My radiation was an outpatient thing; I was still in classes during it. I got a ride every morning with a classmate to the hospital I work at, went to class, and walked over to the cancer center for radiation. I had blood tests run every week basically, to make sure the Temodar didn't kill my immune system. If his immune system is fine now, I think it might still be an outpatient thing, but the doctors could tell you more accurately. Radiation sucks, and if he wants you there, be there. Personally, I'm more of the suffer in silence type... so I appreciated my family not seeing me like that. Your experience may vary, just... don't be afraid to ask him, or your doctors.

Epwavl,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_7e7pag,4,dq3ozsp,"I'm so sorry that you and your family are going through this. Without knowing the specifics of her disease, I can give you a general idea of what you might see in coming weeks/months. With regards to cognitive and motor decline that she is experiencing- this could certainly mean that she may not have a lot of time and these things will likely get worse. There are some medications such as steroids or even avastin that may be used to alleviate these symptoms- but that depends on what is appropriate for her situation. She may exhibit personality changes or further confusion about people/places/situations. Everyone is different and I've seen people go through all different time frames with brain tumors. One thing that should happen (if it hasn't already) is that her providers should have a discussion with family (and with her to the extent she can understand) about goals and priorities going forward. For example, if it is very important to spend one more holiday season together, they may discuss the possibility of a feeding tube so she can be fed after it is no longer safe for her to swallow. But if the priority is quality of life over quantity,  you may want to discuss strictly palliative hospice care. This might involve letting her continue to eat and drink for comfort with the knowledge that she may decline further. 
And finally, towards the end (I have no idea when this will be) she may stop talking/responding at all and mostly lie in bed. She won't want to eat or drink and that's ok. The important thing is I really believe people can still hear and understand they are loved and around family so even though it's an incredibly difficult time, loving words and holding her hand may provide comfort. 

And don't forget to take care of yourself. This experience can be so stressful and bring up emotions that may surprise you. That's ok- and part of the normal grieving process.

tiffylicious,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_7e6ne9,2,dqhuikn,"I wish you, your brother, and your loved ones strength, courage, and togetherness in this difficult time. To say it's a rough road ahead, well, that's an understatement - but it is what it is.

&gt; They doctor said he couldn't give a time frame of how much time we have left but said the average patient lives 12-14 mo. Some more, some less. It's hard for me to think that we might only have one year left with my brother...

There's really no way for doctors to give an accurate assessment of how long this journey will last. GBM can throw curve balls and be a completely different experience for everyone.

When my mother had this several of her doctors predicted she would last between 8 to 12 months, **minimum**. She only made it 4 months.

The mindset that got me through it was simply to prepare for the worst and hope for the best - but don't spend so much time focusing on the bad that you forget to enjoy the present.

The journey is painful. Nobody should have to do it alone. Accept help when it is offered. Let friends and family know that you need help, even before you actually feel that you need it.

Don't be afraid to get a second opinion for a treatment plan/surgical assessment. The most important factor in picking your doctor/team is finding somebody that you are comfortable with. Treatment plans will be fairly standard across the board.

It helps to have a Neuro-Oncologist as the backbone of your treatment plan - but in some areas that isn't always possible.

There are financial support options for GBM in various countries. There is a streamlined process for GBM patients for qualifying for social security disability, etc.

Do what you can to make sure your brother is comfortable. Observe how different medicines and treatments effect him. When he is uncomfortable (such as with these headaches) work as best as you can to find a solution. Take notes at doctors appointments. Advocate for him.

Information is going to be thrown at you constantly. Don't get bogged down in it. It's helpful to bring someone with you to doctors appointments so that you can both take notes and compare. If you have questions for your doctors, ask.

GBM tends to cause far more emotional pain than it does physical pain. Many GBM patients really don't have bad pain, nausea, etc. A lot of the pain is emotional, and a lot of the emotional pain is felt by the loved ones of the patient.

Make sure your brother tells you what his death preferences are. Do not wait. Get a will if he needs one. Get all of this out of the way now, so that you can all focus on living.

Have an idea of what hospice options are available to you ( various companies, in home vs facility, palliative care vs intensive, etc). The end of a GBM journey is too difficult for most families to handle on their own. I know it sounds horrible now to even think about this kind of thing - but if it's something you can handle it's worth looking into.

If/when you reach the stage that hospice or long term palliative care is appropriate it can be very overwhelming when the hospital presents you with the centers and services that are available. Hospice is not a bad thing. For many families it's one of the most peaceful parts of the journey; sad but peaceful. I wish that we had started in-home palliative care long before it came to hospice care, but we weren't aware it was an option.

**Which brings me to my next bit of advice:** Make use of all the resources at your disposal. The hospital should have social workers, financial advisors, etc. Make use of them. They are there to help you.

&gt; But from what I read, gbm doesn't typically respond well to treatment... 

It's different for everyone. Yes, GBM has very poor survival statistics. It's such an aggressive and resilient cancer that treatments are more for palliative reasons, and have not changed much over a few decades. We are forced into this journey and immediately piled with very grim statistics and overwhelming amounts of information.

I've met with and read experiences from others, and honestly I feel that the statistics are really of little use to the families and patients. What happens will happen. It's okay to have that mental ballpark of what a timeline might look like, but don't focus on it. You have to live and love, and take things one day at a time.

You can find hope in hearing the stories of those who last 6 years and beyond, or sorrow in the stories of those who only made it 6 weeks. I've met and talked with families and survivors from both side of the spectrum. At the end of the day it will really boil down to what your brothers tumor has in mind. **Do not get bogged down in the statistics.**

When looking at any offered treatment, consider the quality of life that comes with it. For some people things like Optune or a Ketogenic diet are worth the **chance** at a couple extra months, for others it would be hell on earth. Ultimately it's up to the patient. For instance, we elected not to have mom do the ketogenic diet (even though I was already familiar with and actively practicing it for my own epilepsy).",t3_7e6ne9,,2017-11-29 06:24:50,/r/braincancer/comments/7e6ne9/brother_diagnosed_with_stage_iv_gbm/dqhuikn/,,,

tiffylicious,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_7wzgj7,2,du5163m,"I am deeply sorry for your diagnosis at such a young age.

Try not to give up just yet. No matter where you live, there is generally a ton of financial, physical, and emotional support for Glioblastoma patients. In the United States you qualify for expedited processing on disability/insurance.

Because of your age, doctors may be willing to try more drastic/experimental treatments. Find yourself a team that you are comfortable with. Make sure that a neuro-oncologist is a part of your primary treatment plan. They will have the most experience with how to battle GBM. Other types of doctors that you can look into for the team are neuro-radiologists, and oncology dieticians.

Since you are so young I strongly recommend starting physical, occupational, and speech therapies as soon as you start having deficits. They will help you to maintain, improve, and adapt to your changing capabilities. Sometimes it can be completely free to have them physically come to the house too with insurance; whereas going to see them at their facilities almost always costs a high co-pay.

Speak with your doctors and the social worker at your hospital. They are there to help you. The social worker should be a wealth of information about all the things I've mentioned.

Keep in mind that the statistics are the median lifespan from diagnosis for the entire population of people who are diagnosed with GBM. This means old people, sick people, people who aren't diagnosed until really late, etc; all of these are included in the median prognosis. Every GBM experience is different, and the survival rates can only be used as a ballpark to manage our expectations. There are (high functioning) people who have lasted a decade and longer with the diagnosis. It's bad, but you never know where you will end up.

&gt;  i want it to be quick and easy.  i don't want to suffer. 

After discussing with your doctors and loved ones, if this is your wish you may want to go ahead and create advanced directives for things like life support, end of life care, and the specifics of what you do and do not want.

When the end-time comes (and hopefully it's very very far away!) consider palliative care, and then hospice. Good hospice centers will provide your loved ones with the most comforting experience during and after, and excel at making sure you (the patient) do not suffer.

Things to ask about:

Radiation: Proton Therapy vs IMRT

Medically-guided Ketogenic, high-alkaline, and low-cholesterol diets

Supplements aren't going to cure you but certain ones have been shown to provide slight benefits to different symptoms. I'm not experienced with them so find someone who is if that's your thing.

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. 

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

FrauKoko,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_awp197,3,ehqeakm,"Are you in the US? I would ask her neuro onc or rad onc to get you in touch with the program's social worker. Depending on her age, she may qualify for a homemaker services through the department of aging. These services are for a few hours a week but can help with dishes, chores, etc. It's not everything but does help take the burden off her and her caregiver. It does take a bit of time to set up. 

She may also qualify for home nursing which again is just a couple times a week but can help with ADLs (bathing, etc). If she already has home nursing set up, have the nurse open a home physical therapy and home occupational therapy referral. They will come to the house and work with her at home. 

The social workers where she's being treated are super helpful and have a ton of experience with navigating the system. I'd also ask if there is a supportive oncology department - they can also help navigate. 

I'd also ask for referral to a rehab program. If she has already been discharged from the hospital, she unfortunately will not qualify for inpatient acute rehab but she can do a day rehab program. If she's still in the hospital, express your concerns and ask for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy consult. They can then assess what she might need (inpatient acute rehab, sub acute, or day rehab). But for inpatient, she will require 2 services to qualify and cannot be discharged home then go to acute.

Day rehab has a lot of benefits and will target her needs. Depending on her insurance and needs, she may do half day or full day programs upto a few times a week. A lot of these rehab programs also help with transportation.

If she has a palliative care provider, they also have resources and social workers to help navigate. This is especially true for when she's ready for hospice care. If you're unfamiliar with palliative care - they are the doctors that help manage symptoms and quality of life while the patient is still getting treatment during a life threatening disease. Whereas hospice is for end of life care once treatment has been stopped to help relieve pain and other agonizing symptoms (shortness of breath, anxiety, etc). Hospice is a truly phenomenal program and helps relieve both the patient and caregivers. If she isn't seeing palliative, I highly recommend it. 

Source: I am a medical provider and set patients up with these services often - I couldn't do my job without the social workers and case managers.

Any good onc or palliative doc will assess throughly to target the appropriate nausea pathway. There are 4 pathways chemo receptor trigger zone, cortex, peripheral, vestibular. Depending on which is the cause d2, 5ht3, nk1, or h1 can be added. 

You're doing the right things in a nonpharmacologocial way. Besides what you're doing, the Zofran can be taken 1-2 hours before the temozolomide. Do not eat 2-3 hours before the chemo. The temozolomide should be taken with a large glass of water. My husband's nausea is much worse if he doesn't follow that. Also, if his neuro onc says it's okay, the closer he takes it to bedtime, the more likely he can sleep through the worst of it.

My husband did great with the 7 weeks of chemo/radiation. However, he's miserable on the 5/23 with relentless vomiting and fatigue. He's on 5 different meds and cannibis but still vomits frequently.

It turns out his tumor was much more advanced than usual at diagnosis—it began in his right temporal lobe, but had already gone through the corpus callosum and way working it’s way back towards the temporal lobes. He needed a VP shunt within a week of diagnosis due to severe hydrocephalus symptoms. Because of the shunt he is not eligible for clinical trials. He gets his care from a neuro-oncology team, and we got a second opinion from a brain tumor center. Both recommended the same thing—3 week’s of palliative radiation + temodar. This was based in his Karnofsky score, which was borderline for recommending any treatment. They did not mention Avastin but they did mention optune for down the road.

I have a call in to his Onoclogist to ask about Optune, and I’ll ask about Avastin too. As for the quote of time he has left, the Oncologist only reluctantly agreed to make a guess because my brother pressed her on it (he can be a bit much sometimes).

I know his level of functioning will be a big part of any decisions. He is now probably somewhere between a 40-50 on the Karnofsy scale. He thinks he’s a 70 and believes he is getting better. He refuses all help from hired aids and even close family. So we are in a tough spot to try to keep him safe at home, explore every avenue that makes sense, and also respect his wishes and maintain his dignity. Which is why we got hospice involved—a nurse comes and checks on his medical well being and supports the rest of us in this process.

I apologize if this isn't the place to get this off my chest, but I'm having difficulty managing my mother's care.  She was diagnosed back in April with a 2.4cm mass in her left parietal lobe, after being admitted to the ER with symptoms of aphasia, short-term memory loss and disorientation.  Initial scans painted an optimistic picture (near the skull, easily operable, likely a benign meningioma), but the biopsy confirmed extensive necrosis and differentiated vascular tissue that earned it a Grade IV GBM diagnosis.

My mother's always been an emotionally volatile person, but the way this has affected her memory has made the handling of her care extremely difficult.  The complexities of her medication are difficult for her right now, and when she gets frustrated about anything she lashes out.  When I begged with her to relax, and let me handle the timing of when to take which pills, she got downright vicious with me, accusing her of calling her an idiot and insinuating that she'd rather work with an attorney or some other party to manage her treatment.

I'm just...  Tired.  She's lived alone for years (and fiercely values her independence), and has resisted any overtures of mine to move in with my partner.  She's always been hostile towards medical professionals for even the slightest (and often imagined) transgression, and it was a blessing that she bonded quickly with her surgeon...  Though she hates her radiation oncologist, and dreads seeing him every time we go into the hospital for treatment.  None of this treatment would even be possible if I hadn't insisted for years that she allow me to pay for her health insurance, and she continues to call herself a 'burden' even though (amazingly) all of her claims have been paid in full.

A stroke or seizure while unsupervised is a very real risk, but...  Are there options?  I'm not a 24/7 caregiver, and I moved out years ago because of how hostile our home had become.  Returning to live under the same roof as my mother, and having the same arguments nightly because the damage to her short-term memory makes it impossible to resolve any disagreements rationally, is taking a toll on both of us.  She wields her guilt like a knife, and I want to give her some space so she doesn't cut me with it.

I'm planning on moving into a short-term rental nearby, so I can continue to take her to her treatments but also have some privacy for my own peace of mind.  Has anyone been through something like this?  I want to be compassionate, but I also need to survive this process too."

My mom has grade IV GBM too. She’s one week out from completing 6 weeks of radiation and concurrent 130mg TMZ. (The tumour was not removed during her craniotomy, unfortunately). 
Fatigue is the most common side effect of radiation, increased sleeping is normal. My mom actually barely napped at all throughout the course of her treatment which surprised me. But the steroids are really affecting her sleeping patterns, especially at night. Now that she’s done the treatment I can tell the fatigue is catching up to her. But it is good to encourage some daily movement. 
My mom has some balance and strength issues too ... she uses a walker now, which took some convincing, but it helps a great deal. I don’t expect her mobility and balance to improve much, maybe a bit as a the swelling goes down, but since the tumour is still there I anticipate it only worsening in the future. 
She also struggles with speech. Word finding, stuttering, forgetting. Again, normal for where her tumour is (left parietal lobe). 
Finally, as far as headaches go... that’s a continuous struggle for her. Her pain management is ongoing, we spent 10 days in a palliative complex care unit before her treatment, in order to get her pain managed. It definitely served its purpose but now we are back at a point where they want to admit her again and she is adamantly against it.

Do you think your family would be more receptive to framing the question around your BILs care? Like asking the best and worst case scenario so you can make sure he’s taken care of? I made some headway with my dad with a “plan for the worst and hope for the best” approach. Of all the things to manage with my moms cancer, I’ve found that everyone’s emotions and expectations have been the hardest and most unexpected.

If her cancer is terminal and you’re able to get your family and the doctors to engage in the conversation, here are a few things that I wish I had known/done when my mom was diagnosed. The first is to utilize a social worker if your hospital has one. You can figure out things on your own, but they have resources that make it so much easier. The second is that palliative care is different from hospice and can be used while receiving cancer treatments. The oncologist focuses on the actual cancer while palliative care focuses on quality of life issues and symptoms (due to disease or medications). In the US, it’s billed like any doctors visit and usually covered by insurance.

Lastly, this is probably new territory to you. You won’t know all the answers and your family will have to make decisions that don’t have any good options. Any decision that you all make with love and genuine concern is the right one.

I wanted to give a quick thanks to folks here for your support and well wishes. And a little update.

Things have changed since my last post, my husband is a lot more alert and he's also home now. He was discharged Thursday 19th. The first thought was that he'd be discharged to a rehabilitation facility (in the same hospital) but they sent him home so he could start his treatments ASAP. For some reason insurance doesn't pay for treatments while he's inpatient. So he's home. He's been resting a lot and is pretty mobile with a walker, but he gets tired really easily. Both he and our toddler are napping now.

I'm extremely happy to have him home. This is the best place for him, much more restful than the hospital and quiet, so his sleep has been much better. It has been very emotional. I'll see our daughter playing with him and I get so happy, and I take pictures, then I want to start crying. It's a roller coaster. His mom stayed with us last night but today it's been pretty quiet, so she went home today and is going to come back to help cook us a Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday.

The social worker at the hospital said he tried 19 places around town to find us some in-home help for physical therapy, and didn't find any, but we have an interview next week with someone from palliative care so I am hoping they can help us out with PT. 

If he's up to it, we're going to go drive around to look at Christmas lights tonight. Our city just turned on the lights downtown yesterday."

promelid,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_k2httx,22,gduai0n,"My husband was diagnosed earlier this month so I am seemingly only a few steps ahead of you guys. Love and best wishes and prayers to your family. Strength and courage to all of you. 

Someone on a grief forum said something tonight that really resonated with me. She looks for hope from people who are at the stage right after hers. People who pull their lives together, feel happiness again. People a month ahead of her. Two months. A year. I realized I was trying to do the same thing. Looking for people who managed to make it to the step after mine.

So as I am in the stage right after yours, maybe my story can help you figure out a little of what you can do next. Hopefully.

I knew it was glioblastoma early on. I don't know how, I just knew, from the first time he texted me from the ER that they found a mass in his brain and were transferring him to another hospital. I don't know how I knew... I just did. But every step of the way there were ""gates"" of diagnosis we went through. And each step made it realer and it hurt, even if I knew it already. In my heart, I knew.

The MRI with contrast showed the tumor was almost certainly a glioma.

After poking around in my husband's head, the surgeon said it's definitely an aggressive brain tumor of brain origin. 

The PA working with his radiation oncologist let me know it's looking like glioblastoma. That was the first time I heard the word said to me out loud. The word scared me. I could barely function that day. What a scary, horrible word. A life altering terrifying word.

Then I read through his charts and the word ""glioblastoma"" was scattered everywhere starting from the day of surgery. Like it's nothing. Sprinkling it everywhere. Glioblastoma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma. Can't they use a thesaurus? Is there even a synonym for it?

It was a sucker punch each time.

For your dad... It's possible it isn't glioblastoma. Pathology does a ton of very deep testing to make sure of everything. But if the same experience happens to you that happened to me, let yourself feel grief with every gate and confirmation you go through. There's no such thing as being ""done"" with it. Words mean something. Diagnoses mean something. I tried to stop myself from crying each time I heard the word because I already went through that once right? What's the point in doing it again?

It's the whole Voldemort ""he who must not be named"" thing. Avoiding the word just makes the word stronger. I withered when I read his chart. Every time I saw it, I felt like vomiting.

But something else happened. I read it again. It was a weird tic. A strange impulse. Like a horror novel. The timeline of my husband's hospital stay. And I read it again. Slowly the word lost its power. Now I can type it again and again. Glioblastoma. It's put itself into my phone's dictionary. Fuck that word. Glioblastoma. The word can't hurt me. I can write it on an insurance form like it's nothing now. I own that stupid word.

It's an odd form of power, but I'll take any power. I feel so powerless otherwise. 

Glioblastoma. 

I've managed to drag myself into the anger stage of grief. I'm mad at that stupid word. And anger, I can do something with. Anger gives me energy. 

I've channeled my anger and looked into every resource I can think of. Medical marijuana. Palliative care. Coordinating family to help. Buying tickets and arranging a wheelchair for the local outdoor Festival of Lights. Filling out reams of paperwork. Calling insurance. Bugging his doctor to prescribe zofran before his chemo starts. Support groups. This subreddit. I paid $100 for next day delivery of a mattress when he couldn't sleep on our crappy old one. 

And every hour my husband is awake I cherish. I take pictures. We laugh. We do estate planning. We play with our daughter.

I don't have a very good answer for you because I'm just a step ahead of you. But I've made it this far when I felt like I was going to fall off the edge of the earth almost a month ago. When this all began. One step at a time. One day at a time.

Due to covid we can’t be there with her, so we just had to wait around for the news. Well, we got it today.  

She has a 6cm mass in her occipital lobe on the left side, and the doctor seems to believe it’s a GBM. They haven’t done a biopsy yet, but they’ve given us some options as far as surgery, radiation and chemo. 

They also gave us a best case scenario time frame of 8 months, worst case a month or two.

FrauKoko,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_moabv6,14,gu35lqp,"I’m going to break this down quite a bit so I apologize if this is stuff you already know. But it is normal to be frustrated and want to do more or as much as possible to fight this cancer. 

First - let’s unpack standard of care. If you do a google search you can find several well known and top rated facilities, their approach to brain cancer, current and past research studies, clinical trials, current standard of care etc. Unfortunately, research, trials, approval, etc are a very time intensive and slow going processes. Some cancers get more attention and resources than others which also affects how quickly stuff can get done. Some cancers are more rare than others which limits how many people  can be recruited for trials - again slowing everything down. The brain is also fickle because of the pesky blood brain barrier. Not every tumor has the same genetic and molecule profiles - making it more useful for some patients and less useful for others. So it gets complicated. 

[Management of glioblastoma: State of the art and future directions](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21613) is a recent article to see how GMBs are managed and what future treatment can look like. 

Yes, the cycles you’re describing with temozolomide is the standard of care after radiation. 

Currently, the treatments that currently give GBM patients the longest overall survival include: maximal safe surgical resection, radiation with concurrent temozolomide (at a lower dose), followed by maintenance cycles of higher dose temozolomide.  

However, how the patient actually responds is highly variable and dependent on several factors: IDH status, mgmt promoter status, age, functional status, location, extent of resection (just to name a few). These prognostic factors are generally seen to increase or decrease overall survival in *most patients* but it isn’t a hard and fast rule or guarantee. So it’s really hard to treat and prognosticate brain cancer. 

Because what sucks is that having good prognostic markers doesn’t *guarantee* you a better prognosis or overall survival. In theory, if you have good prognostic features you will have a better prognosis or overall survival than those who have poor markers. In other words, you may have several or all of the “good” markers but have minimal response to treatment. Likewise, you may have shitty prognostic markers and actually have a better than expected response to treatment. 

Chemotherapy is often dosed in cycles. The length, frequency, and duration is highly variable on the type of cancer, type of drug, toxicity, goals, and response. Some chemo is dosed frequently while some need more time between rounds. It just depends. 

Chemo isn’t like a medication that you take a daily medication for a chronic condition like high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, or high cholesterol. 

Chemo works by disrupting cell replication. Some chemo acts on a specific part of the cell cycle while others are non-specific. I won’t go into the different parts of the cell cycle. But the goal is to disrupt the cell cycle to slow or stop growth. 

But we know that cancer cells replicate faster than normal/healthy cells. Chemotherapy impacts both cancer cells and normal/healthy cells. Chemo doesn’t just target cancer cells - it gets them all. 

The idea behind cycles is to blast the cancer cells but give time for your normal/healthy cells to rebound. If you blast everything away you won’t have the normal/healthy cells to do their job. 

Temozolomide is myelosuppressive. Meaning it suppresses at least two of your cell lines. This can technically occur at any dose but is much more prevalent at higher doses. Myelosuppression can be severe (sepsis, bleeding, neutropenic fever) and usually reversible but it can be fatal. This is why they monitor your blood counts. Most of your cell lines will recover between cycles - but platelets are the ones that stay chronically low through treatment and take longer to recover. 

Nadir means when your cell lines are at their lowest. This can vary from patient to patient but with temozolomide cycles is around 14ish days with recovery in 15ish days. This is why the cycles are timed as they are. However, if your ANC or platelets are too low your neuro onc will delay starting your next round until your cells have recovered sufficiently as it is too dangerous to start the next round. Usually it is only a week but could be longer. 

More chemo doesn’t mean better prognosis. The side effects are just too dangerous. You can’t live with no cells. It’s a balance between killing cancer cells but keeping your normal/healthy cells. 

Like you said, glioblastoma isn’t curable. Treatment for GBM is palliative - meaning treatment won’t cure you but it can slow growth, relieve/reduce symptoms such as seizures, and potentially lengthen your survival (compared to not treating at all). If you can slow down or delay growth it helps with symptom management. 

Treatment of cancer is highly regulated and dependent on what country you’re in. Medications in general are to treat certain conditions and are only to be used at certain doses/duration/frequency. If you use those medications outside of its intended purpose or outside of its regulated dose/frequency/duration it is called “off label”. Many insurance companies (private or government provided) will not pay for off label use. Additionally, with some drugs it is too dangerous and strictly prohibited. Also, not all physicians can prescribe all drugs. Some drugs require specialized training and certification to prescribe and administer (including many chemotherapy medications and methadone - in the US at least). This isn’t the wild west. No oncologist is going to risk their patients wellbeing or their medical license by treating outside of safe parameters established. 

Brain cancer is super shitty. We don’t have good treatments for it and a lot more research needs to be done. That is incredibly frustrating as a patient because you want to do all you can. But standard of care, regulations, etc are there for your safety. More needs to be done for brain cancer but over dosing on temozolomide isn’t going to help you...in fact it may kill you before the GBM would have otherwise. If only it were that easy and straightforward. 

You can always get second opinions and look at clinical trials. In fact most folks encourage it. Brain cancer is very complex and nuanced. But all you can do is get a second opinion or seek out trials. You won’t have any luck finding an oncologist to treat you based on what you’re suggesting. 

You might be able to get an adjuvant therapy like the optune device but I’m not sure if that is available where you are. But it’s not a cure either. Just another shitty option that may help slow growth or may not. 

Hope that helps. Best of luck.",t3_moabv6,t1_gu35lqp,2021-04-10 22:09:50,/r/braincancer/comments/moabv6/current_treatment_questions_and_concerns/gu35lqp/,,Current treatment questions and concerns,"Nov 2020  I was diagnosed with brain cancer. They  found a large tumor in  my head (via CT Scan and  then MRI). Had brain surgery to remove  the tumor (a glioblastoma). Since then went through the stage of chemo therapy involving temozolomide and radiation for two months (3 to 4 days per week).

I'm doing fine. Brain function seems normal. I walk my dog 3.5 to 5 km every day. I'm doing pretty much what I used to pre-cancer diagnosis. The chemo isn't kicking my ass. For the most part, I don't feel like someone who has cancer.

My questions and concerns are regarding my current stage of treatment, which is chemo only, no radiation.

I'm on a 28-day cycle. At the start of each cycle I receive five doses of extra strong t3mozolomide (430mg). I take a dose per day. Then nothing until I see my oncologists again, 23 days later (when I receive another 5 doses).

This treatment strikes me as batshit crazy. So, we actively try killing cancer cells for 5 days (6 days if I'm being generous, because the half-life of temozolomide is 2.8 hours), then we let the cancer run rampant (replication and tumor growth) for 23 days. I don't think one has to be a rocket oncologist to know what is going to win that race, cancer death (5 days) or cancer growth (23 days). I told my doctors this, and requested 10 doses of temozolomide every 28 day cycle, but they refused, stating that there is no studies that would support the extra doses as being successful. Which pissed me off to hear, because it's not like the current treatment program is what I would call successful, since there are no brain cancer survivors (as far as I am aware).

I'm curious about the treatment of other brain cancer patients. Where are you being treated, and does treatment eventually match this 28 day cycle that I am on? My doctors have made it seem that I'm on a fairly standard treatment program for brain cancer. But how am I to know for sure, since I don't know any other brain cancer patients. I'm so glad this subreddit exists, maybe I can finally get some answers.

If you're kind enough to answer, maybe state where you're being treated from? If your treatment sounds awesome to me, I can then at least give my doctors a place to consult.

Me? I'm being treated out of the Tom Baker Cancer  Center in Calgary, Canada.

We’re also pretty stunned as my Dad’s mother died from brain cancer in 1981 at the exact same age (72). What is your advice on questions for us to ask tomorrow? And while I know there is a rare likelihood that this is genetic, given that my paternal grandmother and now my Dad both were diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer, should we also inquire about genetic testing for my sister (39) and me (35)?

Appreciate any wisdom you might be able to share."

I will be the first to admit I probably sound (and am) ignorant because I just thought if you had only a few weeks left you’d be in bed with tubes etc. (I know. I’m uninformed and have had little experience with dying people. Please don’t judge me.) Can this be the case in late stage brain cancer? Or could they have misunderstood their diagnosis?

It sounds like you have a wonderful family. I’m so happy that you and your wife insisted on a scan. The only way that this story could have been worse is if your poor mother was sent home from the hospital without any diagnosis or help. 

I’m glad you opted for palliative care. There is nothing else you could do but try to keep him comfortable and give your desperate family some reprieve.

So I’ll write my/his story.

Dad was 67 when he got diagnosed with glioblastoma in mid November. He was relatively in his usual state of health. We noticed that his mood was getting indifferent for some time. Normally he would talk to us on the phone for a few minutes but we noticed that it would only be for a minute before handing it off to my mom. He seemed like he was being less social. We thought maybe it was because of COVID-19 ruining his social life of going to the library and hanging out with some friends. He knew something was off as well so he went to his doctor who told him that maybe he should see a therapist to help with how he’s feeling. That was to be scheduled for a week or so later.

Leading up to the therapist appointment my mom called and said that dad was sleeping more and that she noticed his walking was a little different but he insisted that he was fine. He was still driving the car to take my mom to work and stuff too, so all we could say was to keep an eye on it. Then one day he slept all freaking day. He woke up for an hour in the morning and went back to sleep and refused to wake up. We told her to keep trying and to take him to the hospital because this isn’t normal. My mom tried her hardest and she eventually called her brother and sister in law to try to help get him up. He finally gave in and changed his clothes to go but then became stubborn and said no again. They threatened to call an ambulance to say that he is a danger to himself in order to both scare him and get him to go worse come to worse. He eventually went to the ER. Apparently he was doing okay there. He was eating food and was asking when he could go home. The doctor spoke to us since my wife and I are hospital workers. The ER resident said that they are doing lab work but he seems okay. We explained the above story and we convinced the doctor to do a CT scan of his brain because this was an acute situation. They came back and said that he has a large brain tumor and that they want to transfer him to another hospital because they are better equipped to take care of it. My wife is a doctor and asked the doctor what they think it is to which they said that it looks like glioblastoma. My wife gave me a big hug and said she was sorry. I had no idea why she was giving me a hug and she explained it to me. It sucks.

My brother and I live on the East Coast. We flew out the next day to be with mom since dad was admitted and she was alone. Due to the size of the tumor on the MRI the doctor said surgery is an option but that he can only take about 30% of it out because of its position in the brain. Surgery was a success and he went with the normal treatment options of chemo and radiation therapy, and also Avastin. His biopsy results were IDH wild type, MGMT unmethylated. It went okay for the most part. He was pretty worn out near the last week of radiation therapy. We had to cancel an appointment or 2 because he was so weak and tired. We had palliative care be apart of the team immediately as my wife had recommended to us. We were hesitant because palliative/hospice always has such a negative meaning. It was one of the best decisions we made. They were very good and helped us make sure that dad was comfortable with the correct medications, and explained the situation to us.

His original MRI showed that he had a 7cmx5cmx5cm mass. In went down post surgery a bit. A few weeks later we did another MRI before the radiation therapy. It showed that the tumor had grown back to almost the same size it was before surgery. Obviously not good, but we decided to go ahead with everything to give him a shot. Dad’s tumor is on the left side of his brain, which subsequently unfortunately made his right leg and arm very weak and almost paralyzed. The Avastin amazingly allowed him to use that part of his body almost perfectly. He was walking around and generally was doing better for a bit. The second treatment didn’t work as well. Our neuro oncologist spoke with us after his final radiation therapy session and basically told us that the next dose of Avastin was not going to work for him because the 2nd dose did not work as effectively as the 1st dose. He said that further Chemo is not going to improve his outcome or quality of life. And so we stopped it. A week or so later we put him on hospice as he started sleeping quite heavily one day. I selfishly wanted a final MRI done to see if putting my dad through all the chemo, radiation, and Avastin was even worth it. But I couldn’t subject my dad to this when he was as weak as he was. The results were not going to change anything anyway. So from February until now he has been hospice.

He was doing fairly well for the most part. Eventually we had to move him to the hospice bed once he started getting weaker. We started using the commode more as well cause he couldn’t walk that well anymore. Finally we had to use diapers on him cause he wasn’t able to control it anymore. Then last week the bad times happened. He started vomiting a lot one day from early morning to the afternoon. We gave him an antivomiting suppository after having the hospice nurse come visit. We also had to give him a diazepam suppository because he was having seizures. The nurse told us that they would be coming to visit us daily now instead of 1-2 times a week. They said that he will be transitioning to death soon.

He threw up again yesterday night just the one time luckily. The nurse was telling us that he may die in the next few days or possibly week. He hasn’t been eating or drinking much. He is “emptying out his body” now as well via urine, bowel movements, and vomiting too. We knew it was coming since November. My brother and I have come to terms with it for the most part. Mom still needs time. Either way it’s gonna suck losing him.

TL;DR — Glioblastoma multiforme sucks so damn much. We're in the endgame now.

Edit: Just wanted to add that this is a great community. I have learned so much from you guys. I hate to say it but I'm glad that I'm not alone in this."

I’m not sure what province you’re in, but you should have access to home healthcare support through your Community Care Access Centre. Can you speak to you father’s PCP to get hooked up with that? They should send a caseworker to assess his needs, and it should happen fairly quickly. Has he been referred to a palliative care doc yet? 

Also, caregiver benefit and compassionate care benefit are two different things. You may qualify for one if you’ve only taken the other. 

At the very least, reach out to his oncologist and ask to get the ball rolling on some support. You don’t have to do this all alone.

Last year my dad presented with stroke like symptoms, and with weird symptoms continuing months after the 'stroke', they finally did an MRI and found his tumor. He wanted to fight. Surgical removal, aggressive radiation,and his 3 month post treatment MRI in June showed no changes; but after declining the last few weeks I admitted him to hospital and they did another MRI showing reoccurrence in multiple spots. His neurosurgeon won't touch it again and his GP recommended comfort care (understood by me as palliative).  
He is barely able to communicate, with difficulty, usually not making sense or finding the right words; has lost much of his mobility in opposite site leg and can only ambulate with a walker; he is catheterized; and they said he cannot live alone but are releasing him from hospital care so it is all on me.
I live and work 5 hours away, in another province. Bringing him here isn't a great option as my house recently flooded and is being torn apart, there is no room... and with covid mandates being in his location means I am not allowed to even get groceries because I don't reside there. Plus the financial strain of not working. I already took the max govt caregiver credit when he was undergoing treatments...
And that doesn't even touch on the emotional aspect, everyone thinks I'm sooooo strong because I watched all my family die way before their 'time'. But I'm just a good actor. I know he cared for my mom at home until she passed and I know what it was like... And I have no idea how I can handle it... It seems beyond me. But he wants to be at home. I'm not even sure he understands that he is nearing the last few (weeks? Months?) of his life as he was asking the doctor when he can go back to work...
I'm so overwhelmed and sad and frustrated and angry and... Ugh. I just can't believe how he was doing so well in June and then BOOM worse than he ever was.
Just needed to vent."

My suggestion since she is coherent at this time is to talk to her about options. She seems to be able to understand the processes before her and get a social worker involved. Call palliative care professionals now and she can speak to someone about a living will and also a POA while coherent. 

A social worker can assist in the different options that can be numbing at this time. Also, check on finances for her and see what can assist in this as I am sure your mother would not want anyone to go into debt.

Since she is in California, look into the [American Brain Tumor Association](https://www.abta.org/). They are a great resource for people who may have started this journey. They also have a forum there run on [Inspire](https://www.inspire.com/groups/american-brain-tumor-association/) which are for others who have lived/are living this maze. You can also, as a caregiver/supporter, get support as well.

We discussed all of these success stories with the oncologist. He says it 100% relies on patient biology,  it breakthrough growth on TMZ is not typically a good sign.

This is my(F22) first time posting here.I didnt know where to go and I'm scared.My mom(F54) was diagnosed with GBM stage 4 back(it was on the frontal lobe) in 2010.She had radiation and chemotherapy back then and was healthy with aid of medication(Eptoin) untill 2017.The GBM in 2010 was grade 2 back then but went on to grow and reach to stage 4 in 2017.she was disoriented,sleeping all the time but she was cognitively healthy.she had surgery(all of the tumour was resected)and underwent chemotherapy and radiation as well.But she was not cancer free.But she was alive.All went well with medications and checkups.But during the pandemic all went downhill.We failed to go to check up in the march and it got delayed to November.Thats when we saw tumour grew again.And that was just a start!
Doctor recommend chemotherapy tablets for a month and on the follow up he said it didnt work.Then he said let's try injections.it was four cycles of chemotherapy injections with one injection every 3 weeks.The chemotherapy ended in April 2021 and on follow up doctor was happy as tumour growth went down and the injections worked.She was cognitively healthy and alert.Doctor asked for a follow up after 3 months.Corona was on peak again here in India and mom took vaccine after consulting the oncologist(I think the vaccine had some effect on tumour growth) In june.In July we went for a follow up and in MRI the tumour growth is shown again.That was a bad news.But she was normal and there were no signs of deterioration of cognitive ability or any other symptoms.so doctors asked us not to worry and asked us to come again after 3 months.But after 2 weeks of coming home,my mom started forgetting things,sleeping all the time,disorientation..it started mild but within a week she was a child.Tantrums,not taking care of herself,forgetting to bath,not being able to hold a conversation,incontinence etc.She was forgetting Us.What scared Us the most was of her not being able to swallow anything.not even water.we went to ER and after a long week of checkups and mri,doctor gave us the bad news.
        Her tumour couldn't be operated on as tumour went into the cerebral hemispheres from the frontal lobe and is sitting on main cerebral artery.doctor warned us against surgery as touching it would cause,her to slip into coma or being disabled.we decided not to do it and they send us with bunch of chemo(TMZ).Doctors also said the chemo won't work as effectively and that it would only make her end stage life comfortable.we went back home and we put Mom on a food pipe.At this stage she was talking a little,walking and pooping well(she is still having problems eating and all her cognitive skills gone).she still remembers us.but since last 3 days she is weak and vomiting continuously.Nothing stays in her stomach and we are so scared.Whatever the liquid food is entering into her stomach she is violently ejecting it.
Doctor told it was the effect of tumour as it is growing.
I don't know what to do and I'm scared.so scared.Its breaking My heart watching her suffer so much (on a bright side im relieved she is not aware of it).I'm feeling helpless and angry.Its not fair.

Is she entering into end life stages?

If she's in palliative care now, I suggest you get to know the drugs that your mom can take to be comfortable and pain free. Also it's important to be there with her and talk to her even if she can't speak. On my dad's last day I spoke to him and also squeezed his hand and he squeezed it back. So they can still communicate via body language. Also the hearing is the last sense that remains before they pass. They can hear everything and can understand what's going on even if they are in a deep state of delirium or if they are half asleep. 

We also were with my dad for most of the day and we fed him and helped the nurses with his grooming. The feeding sessions took 1.5 hours each because his swallowing was so bad that we had to instruct him how to swallow thickened water and pureed food. But eventually he stopped eating anyway because his time was coming. 

As sad as it was, it was a blessing that my dad didn't waste away slowly and only spent a short time in palliative care.

His second seizure was last Saturday morning. He was on the treadmill when he lost consciousness and woke up in the ambulance. They found an almost 6x4cm mass in his frontal lobe invading the corpus callosum. This location means they can’t possibly remove it all without leaving him a vegetable. There is also a second smaller mass nearby. 
I immediately went into “go mode” to find him the best surgeon, the best doctors, the best care. We are now on the eve of surgery and even though it’s only been one week I am desperately exhausted. 
Im trying to stay positive but also afraid to have too much hope before pathology comes back. I find whenever I am “doing” I feel mentally better. When I run out of things to do and start thinking, everything gets very dark inside. I have struggled for years with major depression and severe anxiety. On a good week I can barely take care of myself. How am I going to be able to take care of him too???
He has been stable on Keppra and has been in shockingly good spirits. I keep reminding myself that this past week was the easy part and that it’s only going to get harder from here.

Try to be easy on yourself. You are doing your best. People with glioblastoma typically live the lifespan you were told. My dad would have lived longer if the tumor didn't leak into his spine. But I wouldn't know how much longer. Doctors can also be wrong with prognosis. We were told that my dad has 3 month left when they found it in his spine. He only lived 4 weeks after that. Was fine more or less and then quickly deteriorated and died within 11 days. Everyone's case is different. Some people outlive the prognosis and live another 7 years or even more. But that's rare. In any case, spend time with your mom, tell her she has a chance at a good quality of life, and be supportive however you can be. Also it's very good that you keep track of her meds. You gotta advocate for your mom. I had to do this all the time so they would give my dad all medications and treatments that otherwise they wouldn't give without being asked. They would forget to give him anti seizure meds. They couldn't do much anyhow and they knew we are just buying time and delaying the inevitable. But we still tried. The worst part of it was the anxiety and the anticipatory grief. Once he died on palliative care (we were with him), we were just grateful he was no longer suffering.

He has gone through several rounds of radiation and chemo. The first few times were successful in shrinking the tumors but in the fall the MRI showed it spreading. So yet another round of treatment and the last MRI showed even more spread and there is concern it’s spread to his spine. The doctors said he could only have 3 to 6 months. 

I moved in with my sister and her family 6 Mos ago to help out with my 5 yr old nephew. It’s been fine until recently. As the cancer progresses my Brother in law is forgetting things and mostly sleeps. He is fatigued and sleepy enough that he has forgotten to pick my nephew up from school a few times.

My sister is so hard on him. She constantly berates him. Just always mean and hard on him. I can’t take it. I tell her constantly he can’t help it he’s literally dying. 

It’s really hard to watch her treat him like this. I can only assume it’s her way of dealing or not dealing with grief. 

Does anyone else have experience with a spouse getting frustrated and angry at their dying partner? Any ideas how I can get through to her to chill out? This guy could be gone soon and his last days shouldn’t be this way."

I was wondering if someone could give me some advice on how to adequately care for my dad in the final stage of his cancer?
In the past 10 days he has become bed ridden, unable to support his own weight, using a convene, can’t swallow properly etc. 

As of today he has choked twice whilst drinking water and then when chewing on a piece of chicken I cut up into a tiny piece.

I’m based in the UK, we have district nurses come out but they stay for 10 minutes and just change his plasters. 
I have no idea how to feed him or hydrate him if he is starting to choke?
I’ve asked the doctors to refer us to McMillan for a nurse three times but we haven’t got one yet.
I’m absolutely exhausted, it’s 24/7 care.
I’m only 29 and with my mum we aren’t able to lift or move him, it takes a lot of energy.

How do you care / make them comfortable / feed them when they start to choke?

He has a hospital bed but it never seems to get him into the correct position, I think it’s too small.
I’ve asked them to extend it nearly every day for 10 days and still no extension.
I feel depleted but trying to stay strong

Wojld love advice or guidance or just anything, I don’t want to feel so frightened"

I just moved to the Indianapolis Area from Colorado. I’m a brain cancer patient, stage 2 diffuse astrocystoma. 
I’m about 1 1/2 years out from my craniotomy and tumor resection. 
They were able to remove damn near 99% of the visible tumor which was 4cm  in front left temporal lobe. 
Post brain surgery I’ve been one of the unlucky ones that has had continuous non-stop head/ skull pain. 

They put 3 titanium plates, and 10 titanium screw into my skull. After countless tests, CT scans, and MRI’s they still aren’t completely sure why I’m still having such intense constant pain. 

I’ve tried so many non narcotic treatments and therapies and nothing works besides opioids. 

My current doctor from Colorado labeled it as “intractable cancer related head pain”. 

My recent scan didn’t show any new tumor growths which is amazing! 

Unfortunately they still expect it to regrow again since the original tumor was technically labeled as malignant  it’s just a matter of time they said. 

My doctor from Colorado said she can’t give me any more meds of any kind after March 30th. We’ve been doing telehealth appts since I moved away. 

I’m currently on 6 15mg IR oxycodone’s per day. 

My regimen before that was 2 20mg ER opana’s and 4 4mg dilaudids per day. I want to get back to that regimen or at least some with an extended release med in it. 

Does anyone in the Indianapolis area have any recommendations for pain doctors or pain clinics in the Indianapolis area? Doesn’t have to be right in indy. I’m willing to drive. 

I’ve also thought about trying to get into palliative care, not hospice, but palliative. 

Any thoughts anyone? 

Thanks in advance for all your help! :)"

ManuBennet,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t1_i2sv6i5,1,i2u6hvs,"I'm not sure how you can speak with such certainty when you don't have the qualifications to do so.
I'm not a doctor, but after talking to the leading scientist on how to treat cancer as a metabolic disease and cancer patients and families who have been impacted by GBM, all I can say is that Keto diet somehow makes the standard treatment for GBM more effective. And, no it is not a cure. Even Dr. Seyfried does not know why it works and he admits that.  
My dad's neurosurgeon is also an advocate for KETO and has seen amazing results with the in the five years he has implemented it as part of treatment in patients with GBM. 

My dad went through the standard of care. After 10 radiation sessions his tumor grew and he was put on palliative care. That's when I started doing research and reached out to PHDs who study GBM and nutritionists. I learned that the standard of care does nothing for GBM patients and in a lot of cases, does more harm. 

If you or your family are impacted by GBM, don't trust the small cancer centers to treat you or your loved one. Do your research and find hospitals who specialize in GBM. My dad went to Barrow after he was put on palliative care, and he had a second resection of his tumor. Mayo is another good hospital for GBM. And I would encourage you to reach out to nutritionists who can help with diet management. 
It's unfortunate that people are discouraged from even trying anything that might have a positive effect on their outcome. 

Pablo Kelly refused chemo and radiation and has been managing GBM with just KETO. There might be a lot of factors that contribute to his outcome, but we shouldn't ignore the fact that it did work for him and it continues to work. 

If you are dealing with any type of cancer I would recommend that you don't just rely on the standard of care that has not changed in 50 years. Jane McLelland wrote a book about how she beat cancer twice, and the second time without chemo and radiation. Buy Miriam Kalamian's book Keto for Cancer. There's a wealth of information in those books.

I would keep complaining. Do you bring a friend or family member with you to your appointments? If so they can be another witness to what you’re experiencing when you talk to the oncologist.

WildernessTech,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_udqk78,15,i6ill6z,"I think that it's worth talking about, I understand why it's not, but it has merit. I think because it can easily turn into ""disability dick measuring"" and most people don't really want to go there, but they are scared that's where the conversation might go, so they step out. I think that's fair. 

The value in the conversation is that in the end, well, none of us are getting out alive. The things that cost you something don't always have to be the worst of all outcomes. I only lost my license for six months, only had one seizure, only have to get follow-up MRIs annually. But that astrocytoma (or as I call it, bush-league brain tumor) still cost me my career and limited my career prospects in ways that almost four years in I still can't quite navigate. It's an interesting conversation to have when no one has any authority to decide what I'm allowed to do. 

There is value in the discussion because there is someone out there who will get diagnosed with something that was scary as all hell a decade ago, and they might make it to 90. I don't want that person to live in fear, never take that chance, and never live the life they could have. But I also don't want a family member to think that ""but they got better"" means that there are no scars. I wear mine pretty proudly (well, being bald leaves me little choice) but ""Terry"" is still in there. I'm ""fine"" but no surgery for me. That's what makes the wider conversation with friends and family important. In the surgeon's words ""I can go in and take that out. I don't know who will wake up."" And he wasn't just some guy who hung a sign and decided doctoring was fun. 

I don't know how to make any of it better. But to a degree, I don't need to know. By hearing people, by being part of the discussion, maybe someone is going to have an idea that sparks something. Or maybe I have an idea that sparks something in someone else. Another reason why the discussion is important. 

We all walk our own road, some of us think we see the end, some of us don't. The important thing is that we are all walking in the same direction, and that means that in little ways, we help each other. If all you leave behind are people who remember you fondly, and your little corner of the world is a little better, then I guess it's all worth it. Sometimes I wonder if there isn't just intrinsic value in showing people the way. I know a lot of nurses, all that have worked in palliative care have stories of folks holding on until family arrives, but then passing when the family leaves to take a break from their vigil. Then again, I've also heard stories of elderly people getting a pacemaker and muttering in their sleep, ""why won't they let me die"". Hey, the sun's down in my timezone, the dark thoughts come out, but I think I understand their point. I'm not ready to go yet, but if folks like us can't talk about it, not sure who else will. 

As far as I know, something else will get me first, but I did spend my 33rd birthday in a hospital bed wondering what was next. I'm sure that did something to my mental state. And yeah, there are dark times. For me, it's how long will I go before I find my feet again. I'm probably one of the lucky ones in that I can blame covid for my last couple of years without work. I know it's different for others, other families.

I absolutely don't want to take anything away from your thoughts about the fact that this ends. The fact that in your case that end might be closer than a lot of people would want to think. But I also want to be clear to anyone else that just because the illness or prognosis is x or y doesn't mean that they deserve any less care, or more coddling. Life is what it is, and it's finite. We battle on as far as we can, and sometimes we have to decide when it's far enough. Each person gets to decide for themselves. We can help, we can encourage, and we can support, but at the end, we can let people go gracefully, or we make them hold on out of selfishness. And of course that goes both ways, we can give up, or we can fight so long we end up as miserable bastards that are only fueled by spite. I don't have any enemies I need to outlive (yet). 
It is late, and I've gotten rambly, but sometimes that's where some truth is found. I hope all the best for you.

It’s positive that he is showing improvement and things may continue to improve for a time. As you well know, there is no full recovery from a GBM. 

My dad had a few months of improvement before his final decline. So it’s possible he’ll regain some quality of life. 

Nursing homes and rehab facilities won’t take anyone on chemo because the cost of the chemo drugs are outrageous. We stopped my dads chemo to send him to rehab at one point. 

Check with the hospital or cancer center and see if they can connect you with a social worker. They will have a lot of advice and resources for home help and volunteer services. My mom was able to get tapped into some local networks that provided a bit of much needed help. 

Choose a palliative care hospice center now, they can often help you with supplies. 

We were able to get someone to come in and shower my dad. As well as at home PT &amp; OT. 

If you don’t already have one, try to find a therapist. You need support and to remember to take care of yourself.

""What is your biggest fear?"". I've heard the horror stories, the bleak prognoses, and the heartbreaking stories from those who've had a loved one pass from this.

So when my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor, I had a sinking feeling in my chest that it was GBM. It didn't take long for the pathology to come in and confirm my worst nightmares.

Everything happened *so* fast. My life turned upside down overnight. On the weekend of March 12, my mom started noticing my dad forgetting words here and there. She told me about that on March 16 on the phone (I live across the country from my family) and I just chalked it up to general aging. Cut to March 21 and my mom texts me that she's worried about my dad because him forgetting words here and there progressed to him forgetting words frequently, mixing words up, and not really being able to hold a conversation with him. My mom had just been COVID-19 positive so I was thinking that it could just be COVID brain fog, maybe a UTI. That's what I was hoping for, at least. Something acute.

March 23, my dad finally goes to the doctor. The aphasia was one thing, but once my mom told his doctor about how his leg basically gave out while doing yardwork, he immediately sent my dad to the hospital for a CT. On that CT scan they found the 5 cm mass in his brain in his temporal lobe along his left basal ganglia. The doctor referred my dad to a neurosurgeon at a hospital in Chicago.

I flew home to go to this appointment with my dad and also to support my mom. The consultation with the neurosurgeon in Chicago occurred on March 29, and my dad was admitted to the hospital to prep for a craniotomy the next day. 

The craniotomy happened on March 30. The neurosurgeon resected as much of the tumor as he safely could -- the tumor deep inside his brain was too dangerous to touch. I'm still not sure exactly what % of the total tumor was resected. The neurosurgeon told us that he would likely get discharged within the next 3 days, but what actually happened was much different. 

Prior the surgery, my dad's expressive aphasia was getting worse each day. But other than that, he had no symptoms, especially no physical symptoms. In the days immediately following the surgery, his speech took a huge step backward. He was speaking gibberish. In addition, he developed severe right side weakness. He could kind of move his right leg, but his right arm was basically useless. He went from being able to walk to being bedridden. 

Ever since the procedure, my dad has been in the hospital's inpatient rehab doing physical, occupational, and speech therapy to try to recover the functions that he lost. About a month has passed since the surgery. His speech is somewhat better, but still not great. Lots of expressive aphasia happening, but it's better than the nonsensical gibberish that was happening right after the surgery. He can walk with assistance (someone walking alongside him to ensure that he doesn't lose balance). Unfortunately, his right arm still has no function. 

This whole process has been a logistical nightmare. It's frustrating because we have not spoken with his neurosurgery team since the craniotomy, and I have no idea what caused his severe right sided weakness. The hospital is now kicking him out and we are being forced to bring him home. Nursing facilities won't take him because he needs chemo and radiation. My mom and I are hoping that it will be easier to take care of him than we are expecting, but we don't even really know what to expect. As of now, he needs assistance going to the bathroom, bathing, cutting up food... pretty much with everything. I feel so overwhelmed and scared about how we're going to be able to take care of him.

On the other hand, it's hard not to emotionally fall apart with this happening. I'm 23 years old, my dad is 68. I was actually supposed to start PA school next month but I ended up deferring admission to spend time with my dad. I know that cancer spares no one's feelings and it can hit at any time, but... I'm feel so young. I'm trying to stay as present as I can with everything, but I can't help but think about the milestones he probably won't be there for. 

More than anything else... I just miss my dad. I miss our conversations. 

Sorry this is long. I've been lurking on this sub since my dad got diagnosed and I see how incredible the support is here for one another. I'm hoping that posting here will help me, even just a little bit."

I'm back with an update and I'm hoping for some insight/advice from anyone who may have experienced/be experiencing similar.

Initially, my dad was very much himself but after completing radiation and having more seizures caused by swelling from the radiation, he is different in a few ways. He's quieter, a bit slower to respond, and has lost a considerable amount of weight. If you ask him yes or no questions, he responds almost immediately. It's the open-ended answers that he struggles with. I realize now that I was hoping this ""changing"" wouldn't happen to him. Wishful thinking, I know. Fortunately, we've adapted pretty well to his current abilities.

As far as we know, there is no prognosis (by which I mean, estimated time left-type information from his doctors) and so all focus is pretty much on recovery; physical and speech therapy and standard emotional therapy. We have a meeting with his Oncology team this weekend to discuss some of the choices we'll be facing eventually. Not really sure what to expect from that?

Anyway, I'm  just wondering if anyone else here has experienced similar with a family member? It feels like an odd state of being - the initial pain and fear is long gone and it's like being far enough in to where I can't see the entrance but also not far enough to see any sort of ""ending"".

He’s not really much in the talking mood, and we live quite far from each other, so I’m only able to text and call him now.

I want to be as supportive as possible, but I’m not sure exactly what the outlook in this situation is? I don’t want to hound him for details so I’m just looking to get a rough idea of what he and his mum are likely going to be dealing with for the next few months.

Can anyone tell me what is likely to happen in this situation? Would they even consider operating on a patient that elderly? Or would they most likely just recommend she forgo treatment and try to spend whatever time she has left with her family?

I just want to make sure I’m saying the right things when I reach out to him. I don’t want to be texting him hopeful for her recovery if they’ve already decided not to pursue treatment as that could be hurtful. Like, I said, he’s not really in the talking/texting mood, but I know getting the occasional supportive message from me is very helpful to him, even if he doesn’t have the bandwidth to reply.

Any info on what the outlook for a patient of this age is, or suggestions on how to be supportive, would be very appreciated!

My mom was very upset to know the oncologist wanted her to quit fighting, so now she is determined to try to get on the Optune. We told her it was her decision but I’m worried because the oncologist made it sound like Optune would do more harm than good.

Her memory still seems intact other then getting something’s confused like “Friends is doing a reunion” even though that was several months ago. Long term seems intact still.

There are very strict requirements that most hospice facilities have to let someone move in- typically the patient needs to be within 6 weeks of passing and that’s only if certain conditions are met (not being able to take care of yourself isn’t one of them). 

When my sister had a 3rd or so recurrence of an Astrocytoma, her husband moved her into a nursing home where her care was managed by the facility doctors and the palliative care team.

But I think it’s worth noting the difference between palliative care and hospice care. Hospice is for those within 6 months of passing. Palliative care is for *any* patient with a serious or long term illness, that focuses on patient comfort/quality of life in addition to treatment. Hospice is usually “comfort meds only”, palliative is comfort meds AND meds to treat the disease- it’s still treatment and can even be aggressive treatment, but patient comfort is much more prominent than in standard medical care (don’t ask me why patient comfort is considered special, it’s kinda fucked).  Palliative care isn’t giving up or accepting defeat necessarily.

I need help. What else can I do? What am I not thinking of?

My mother was diagnosed with GBM Grade IV, wild type with specific indicators that said it would be especially aggressive and untreatable back in January. At that time her main tumor was quite large, over 7 cm in length  - and what the Dr told me was that it would have grown that large inside of 5 months. There was also severe indication of microscopic spread and satellite regions. She had maximum surgical resection at the end of January. She wasn't great (significant aphasia, trouble reading and writing, trouble with coordination etc), but she was functioning. 

She had radiation and chemo February to April. It was moved up from end of February to mid February as she lost feeling in her entire right side (one of many ER visits at this point). Radiation did show reduction in size of the main tumor, but with a couple of satellite regions to 'keep an eye on'

She then went through the next 'standard of care' which is increased chemo for 5 days, with 21 days off. By the end of her first round, the family friend I had with her could no longer take care of her and she became wheelchair bound due to lack of strength. She experienced at least some focal seizures where she essentially lost total control of her body for a couple of minutes. I scrambled and after about 2 weeks found someone who could stay with her and help to take care of her (quick ref: she has no family in her area, my siblings and I are all at least 3.5 hrs away if not more, and everyone else family wise that could stay with her outside of her husband, who needs to work to have her health insurance, is farther than that).

She has went through one more round of chemo and when attempting to do the 3rd round of the 6 month SOC, was told her platelets were too low and now she can't do chemo until her platelets have recovered.

Last weekend she started to have blurry vision and was told to go to the ER for an MRI.. again. According to the MRI, it's essentially spread EVERY F***ING where in her brain - there are spots in at least 6 new locations including her optic chiasm. She will definitely lose her sight. She will lose optic movement. It's already in areas that could essentially stop her body from completing autonomic automatic functions like breathing, pumping her heart, etc. 

I've reached out to several clinical trials and it's as though there is all the time in the world. No one acts as though they are running against a clock and it is hellishly frustrating.

I need to keep fighting for her. Don't tell me to accept defeat. I won't. 

If that's your response - to give up - don't bother answering this post - I already know and understand your position. I can understand that palliative care is likely what will occur, that doesnt mean I need to give up on finding other advice/resources.

What am I not thinking of? Are there any clinical trials that will actually get back to you? What has worked for anyone else with GBM of this magnitude. Where can I go? What can I do?"

cobaltnine,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t1_itzcxsg,3,iu0jzji,"Palliative care can be performed at the same time as aggressive care, in that it addresses symptoms, some of which may be related to active chemo or radiation.  Another example you may hear is 'palliative radiation', which can ease symptoms but won't destroy the tumor.  Hospice addresses symptoms but withdraws the aggressive portions of attempting to remove the underlying cause.  Generally meds like Avastin aren't considered a medication for symptoms alone, whereas steroids are.   

I'm sorry for this difficult time.

Hour_Sport4884,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_yowvz8,8,ivh7msv,"Hi! 30F anaplastic (grade 3) oligodendroglioma. We found my tumor early this year, had a gross total resection, finished radiation + TZM in June, and am currently doing 6 rounds of TMZ. 

Grade 3 and 4 are fast growing, that’s why those year estimates are what they are. It’s unlikely you’ve had a tumor your whole life, but unless you have MRIs from childhood, it’s impossible to say how long your tumor was growing before detection. My neurologist guessed mine started in my teens, and I only started experiencing symptoms last fall, but again, no way to know without images. 

My advice: 

Toddler schedule is a good thing: regular meals, snacks, lots of water, naps, and a consistent bedtime. If our most basic needs aren’t being met, nothing else matters. Food (and meds), sleep, safety (including emotional) are priority number 1. 

Have a family member or significant other stay with you to take care of maintenance things if possible: grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, organizing bills, etc. You need to reduce stress and focus on being well. 

Meet with palliative care regularly. My experience has been that my oncologist and radiation oncologist don’t really have time/concern to be deeply engaged in my treatment. Consequently, I’ve experienced quite a bit of pain and discomfort that could have been avoided if someone had just asked me how treatment was going and listened to me. Palliative care listens. They will give you the time doctors don’t. They address both mental and physical distress. They treat you like a human and help find solutions that will work for you. Even if you don’t know what they could do for you/don’t think you need them, it’s worth establishing the relationship at the beginning of treatment so that if things do take a bad turn, you have them in your corner already. 

For what it’s worth, radiation made me pretty emotional (i.e. really decreased both my emotional tolerance and my ability to emotionally regulate) and tired, whereas chemo makes me really nauseated and tired. People tend to be more understanding of physical symptoms so for the emotional ones, it was helpful to just point them out to my SO and family so they understood what was going on, to give me space, and not take agitation/tears/cutting conversations short personally.",t3_yowvz8,t1_ivh7msv,2022-11-07 23:10:00,/r/braincancer/comments/yowvz8/temozolamide/ivh7msv/,r/braincancer,Temozolamide,Hey y’all I(25F) will be starting chemo(temozolomide) in December along with radiation therapy and hopefully I get into the optune clinical trial (insurance is being a dick) so not sure which radiation I would be best receptive to. I had a resection with about 75%-80% removal still waiting on full DNA results to come back but from what I’ve heard it’s either grade 3 oligodendrioma or grade 4 astrocytoma. Oncologist said I’ll have 4-5 or 14-15 years left (doesn’t make sense to me bc it took 25 years for this tumor to give me symptoms) but I’ve been recovering quickly and recent MRI didn’t show any new growth. Feeling optimistic about recovery and the treatment process but if anyone has any tips or words of encouragement I’d greatly appreciate it 🫶🏼

He had been completely fine and the next minute just fell off. CT scans showed a tumour on the left frontal lobe of his brain. The seizures and swelling stopped which made his speech come back and he was 'normal' up until after the surgery. The doctor told us that he removed the whole tumour from his brain (which anybody would take this as good news right?).  Also mentioned that the tumour in his head was new (took about a year to grow). Dad was discharged after 3 days of being in the hospital.

Over the course of 2 weeks, my father has been the complete opposite of his normal character. A once calm and collected respectful man was behaving neurotic. Hands trembling, constant aggression. We all knew it was one of the side effects of the surgery and tumour. He became increasingly psychotic and was even going to the middle of the road. His talking was fine but they were just as if he was trying to say all his thoughts at once.

Yesterday we got his biopsy results and even the doctor was shocked to inform that his tumour was a grade iv malignant glioblastoma. My dad had to also be referred to a psychotherapist because of his 'psychosis' breakdowns. 

I just have a few questions that if anyone could answer, it would help me out a lot. 

1) Is there hope that his personality and behavioural changes would become better eventually? 

2) Since the tumour was relatively new and we caught it early, would it help for his overall prognosis or anything? 

I also would love to hear if anyone could give their own experience with loved ones/themselves that had similar/identical incidents in which things turned out to their favor."

My wife (30, rAA3) has had a really bad turn these past few weeks. She is more tired, confused, off balance, forgetful, spacey, nauseous, anxious, headaches….

She was supposed to get her second round of Keytruda today, and like 20th of Avastin, but they’re holding it due to her labs showing increased liver enzymes above what they’re comfortable with.

And based on her symptoms, they’re having her come in earlier for her scan (tomorrow).

These weeks have been so hard, I’ve had to feed/dress her, accompany her to the bathroom etc etc… 

I guess what I’m asking is, how quickly have people here experienced a decline in their loved ones? How can I anticipate how much quality time we have left together? Anyone have any stories of reassurance?

I thought we would have more time with her being more herself. Her recurrence started more than a year ago, and she has tried chemo, a clinical trial, another chemo and Avastin, and now one round of Keytruda and Avastin. They were holding on radiation as a “last card to play,” and had recommended we go out and look for clinical trials, which is why I thought we would have more time, but these past three weeks have come so fast and hard that I’m just terrified at the downward momentum.

I’m the one that normally takes on the positive/supportive/counseling role to her family, but I am just out of sorts and have no one to turn to to reassure me right now."
trivialoves,t5_2x8y5,braincancer,t3_zbb431,3,iyrs473,"a few opinions because you asked:

mainly I feel like this is kind of a massive undertaking and from what I understand Musella Foundation has already done a lot of that work. I don't mean to shut you down or anything but yeah theirs just came to mind. I admittedly haven't gone through all of it because I saw it way after diagnosis, but their brain tumor guide for the newly diagnosed seems great from what I've seen (+extra trust from me because a doctor from my hospital reviewed/approved it lol).  Link here:  https://virtualtrials.org/Guide/BrainTumorGuidev12.pdf

I def don't think it would be bad to pin that and some other stuff if mods do want. some qs like ""what do i bring to craniotomy"" ""ways to creat memories"" will never have much in the way of updates, gen cancer reddit has a sticky thread where people post things like that (but people will still repost anyway. i dont think we rly need to take them down bc this reddit is a lot less active)

If a separate thing does happen:

- I'm not sure I understand what the surgery/no surgery and chemo/no chemo kind of sections would entail?

- as for what to expect from radiation or something similar: I feel like the commenting format is actually great for those posts. because I'll be the first to tell you, radiation was fkn awful for me. but I know people who have skated through it. I don't know that we could summarize it into one single thing any better than a radiation onc 100% already should have done for a patient. If people want personal experiences of it then posting here or searching will give them a range of that. luckily this reddit isn't so massive that we're getting overwhelmed with these questions if people want to re ask, in my opinion at least

I can think of a few categories and sub-categories people can contribute to based on their experiences.

I also know not all approaches we take may be fully scientifically verified or even endorsed by standard of care and may vary across geographies and should be rigorously labelled as such. Also aware that YMMV.

My initial thoughts on the taxonomy of such a post would be:

Potentially separated to:

A. For the patient
B. For the caregiver

Chronologically:
A. Diagnosis (I have a brain tumor, what do I do next?)
A1. Taking the information in / emotional preparedness
A2. How to interpret medical information given to you e.g location of tumour and grades of tumours.
A3. What questions to ask and how to evaluate the care you are getting

B. Next steps
B1. Defining your priorities e.g. quality of life
B2. Common resources about brain tumors 
B3. Standard of care as defined by WHO
B4. Aid/welfare available to you in different geographies

C. Navigating treatment
C1. Surgery or no surgery?
C2. What to expect before, during and after surgery
C3. How to understand histology results
C4. What to expect and prepare for during, before after radiation
C5. Chemo or no chemo? And understanding different types

D. Palliative and End of Life Support
D1. Mental health resources for caregivers
D2. Palliative/comforting/symptoms relieving supplements, activities etc.
D3. Ideas on filling up the days of your loved ones with the best memories possible and keeping their legacy alive going forward
D4. Hospice and end of life options.

These are just my personal thoughts, as it feels to me that for each of these categories I had to do long periode of hunting and assessing information online. Sincerely welcome your thoughts and the opinions of more experienced folks too.

After a nearly 40 minute seizure the hyper mutation was discovered (avocado sized) and second emergency craniotomy performed. 
He was classed as stable for next 6 months and taking Boswelia, Australian Blushwood Berry, CBD oil, and microdosing powdered San pedro. His Oncologists were panicking at him leaving it “untreated” and talked him into low dose TMZ over a 6 month period assuring us the hyper mutation was caused only by radiation *not* chemo…
Cue second lot of hyper mutation and chemo being stopped a month later due to aggressive deterioration. 
His surgeons were brilliant. His oncology team absolutely appalling. Right from the beginning they showed a complete disinterest in his GBM to the point of even straight up refusing to consider clinical trials. Considering there’s pretty much fuck all they can do for GBM you’d think they’d be willing to look into trying *everything they can*…nope. They were disinterested at best and at some points outright negligent. 
He’s now in the final 6-8 week stages I’d say. His palliative care team from the hospital is…ok. The local palliative care support team is fantastic. 
He was never going to survive GBM but JFC those oncologists were just like “well you’re fucked”.
I’m happy to go into more detail if you have questions.",t3_zk35k2,t1_izxrh77,2022-12-12 17:13:05,/r/braincancer/comments/zk35k2/i_want_to_learn_about_your_experience/izxrh77/,r/braincancer,I want to learn about your experience.,"Dear Redditers,

I am a medical student in Australia and I am highly interested in brain cancer, to the extent of planning to dedicate my career to the field. At the current time, I am writing a 3000-word essay with a significant component reflecting on the personal experiences of patients (and their loved ones) afflicted by these terrible diseases.

I can't imagine the true extent to which some of you have suffered, nor can I articulate your bravery. Accordingly, I would highly appreciate it if you could write some words about your personal experience with brain cancer in the comments or message it to me. I will use these to inform my writing, but also to help me develop a more authentic understanding of how patients and their families battle brain cancer.

If this is not something you are interested in, or you feel as though this is an inappropriate place for me to post this, please let me know.

I wish you all the best and thank anyone who comments in advance."

sparktown,t5_3e8dw,thyroidcancer,t1_f3spxu8,2,f4bksza,"Sure, sorry for taking so long to get back to you. What will most likely happen is your doctor will send you for an ultrasound mapping of your lymph nodes this will determine preliminarily whether or not those notes are affected by any spread of the cancer. This will also help the surgeon who will have to remove the affected portions of your thyroid determine whether or not he also wants to remove lymph nodes. Because lymph nodes are like highway to your body removing ones that are downstream from where the cancer has occurred can help prevent recurrence. You will have to find an ear nose and throat oncology surgeon. General surgeons are able to perform thyroid removals, but in my non-medical opinion you will be best served by finding someone who specializes in the ear nose and throat particularly thyroid removal. You maybe even an option to remove half or all of your thyroid, you may also be given an option to do a minimally invasive surgery or a traditional incision. there are some studies that show, and they may not be reliable, but that those surgeries which are minimally invasive have a higher risk of recurrence. There is an exploratory aspect and some people believe that by having a regular incision the surgeon is able to more thoroughly examine the affected area. after your surgery your thyroid gland that was removed will be sent to pathology and they will send your surgeon the official and final results.  if your surgeon believes that all the margins are clean and that it has not spread that will be the end of it. If your surgeon believes that the cancer has spread locally regionally or to a distant site your treatment options will change. And may include radioactive iodine or other forms of tumors suppressants. After your surgery your incision site will be sore for a few days but you will most likely quickly recover, in my surgery the surgeon had to remove portions of the muscle even with that my recovery was relatively easy. Make sure to get yourself a number of t-shirts that are button down short sleeve so that you can keep the neck of your shirt wide open and well aerated so you don't sweat in the creases of the neck. You will almost certainly stay in the hospital for one night after your surgery and then be released I was able to eat the same day of surgery and that food was normal diet no changes. I would get cepacol lozenges because you will be a little sore from the intubation. your release May change depending on if the surgeon believes they should put in drains, which are very important if the surgeon believes that there could be fluids accumulation and they do not want to trap that inside your body. Six weeks after your surgery you'll likely have to follow up with your endocrinologist to determine how much thyroid hormone you need to take and that your levels are balanced. They will take a blood draw to check your TSH your t3 and your t4 these are non fasting blood draws and very easy mine took 30 seconds. depending on those results you will either be done and over with a follow-up in 6 months or given some thyroxine to help you or thyroid produce the right amount of hormones. Don't be like me and wait I feel like I'm hitting a wall every day around 3. You want your thyroid levels to be properly balanced, but that will take some time because your body needs to recover from surgery the good news is the odds are overwhelming this is in all likelihood a curable condition rather than one requires palliative care. Keep your spirits up while you're going through this treatment you'll see all these people around you who are sicker than you and before long will you make count your lucky stars. Be sure to do your research and don't settle on any physicians you are not comfortable with. Sometimes if you go to small doctors offices rather than a large group or clinic practice you will be stuck leapfrogging appointments with long waits in between oh, because of that I treated with the Cleveland clinic initially and then Baptist hospital system later on for surgery. if you go to the American thyroid association you can find thyroid specialists.",t3_dag5fm,,2019-10-19 19:42:08,/r/thyroidcancer/comments/dag5fm/just_checking_in_with_everyone_fighting_the_good/f4bksza/,r/thyroidcancer,,

Maximum-Cover-,t5_3e8dw,thyroidcancer,t3_rwg55q,5,hrcq96m,"Yeah there isn’t anything they can do after that much unsuccessful RAI. Chemo doesn’t work, more RAI won’t work, more beam radiation won’t work, can’t operate. 

At the stage you’re talking about, palliative care is the only thing left to do. 

This is why people on this sun find it so offensive when the reaction to thyroid cancer is to say “it’s the good cancer”. In cases like your dad’s it’s not a “good” cancer at all.

I’m sorry your family has to go through this.",t3_rwg55q,t1_hrcq96m,2022-01-05 13:52:41,/r/thyroidcancer/comments/rwg55q/anyone_with_lung_mets_have_any_symptoms/hrcq96m/,r/thyroidcancer,Anyone with lung mets have any symptoms?,"My dad had a full thyroidectomy in 2019 and 4 rounds of RAI including some beam radiation on the base of his skull and vertebrae. He has a ton of mets but is doing well overall. One annoying thing he's facing is that he coughs out a ton of phlegm and I mean a LOT. It's gotten so much better since last year after he got the RAI. 

Few hours a day he'll basically cough out everything he can and feel so much better. His doc has given him cough meds but I really don't know how much that helps. I also don't know if this is related to the lung nodules. Some of the nodules absorbed the RAI but some haven't. Just looking to see if anyone else faced anything similar? He's also maxed out his RAI (4 rounds of about 150-180 mCi) so im not sure what his treatment plan will be after this. His doc did imply that there was was much we can do after the RAI."
Aesirtrade,t5_3e8dw,thyroidcancer,t3_sojrbc,1,hwheqsh,"Is anybody aware of the use of cannibas for treatment? I know it has palliative properties and I have no doubt we'll be using it for that, but I'm seeing stuff that shows it might help fight the actual cancer. Any particular strains or formulations? Dosing?

Also hearing some stuff about certain kinds of mushrooms. Immune system benefits and the like. 

Before anybody thinks me crazy please understand two things:
1- I trust in western medicine, I just have no problem trusting natural treatments at the same time.
2- I am a drowning man reaching for anything that might help keep our heads above water. When the current option is a fast an debilitating demise, there is no price high enough for a few months or years of time

If I have to use 12 different things to help her I will do it. The cancer dying by a thousand tiny cuts is just as dead if killed with a single massive blow.

By the time she sought treatment the tumor had grown to the size of a tennis ball. She first noticed the growth about a month prior.  She had it removed and received radioactive iodine.  That did not kill everything.  We have now been told by Kaiser that her scans show metastasis to her vocal cords, neck and lungs.  The oncologist is not recommending chemo or radiation at this time, and they seem to want to sign her up for hospice.

We have scheduled a second opinion review with UCSF and are in process of getting that done over the next week.

Everybody I have talked to says that Kaiser is known for not seeking possible treatments because they are not in the pre-approved formulary.

The current diagnosis, so far as I know, is metastatic poorly differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma.  I don't know any features of the cancer such as genetic traits.

What I'm asking is if anybody knows of any treatments or programs or trials or anything that might give us a shot. I understand this is a hard uphill fight, and the aggressiveness of the cancer is a big problem, but any info anybody can offer would be appreciated."
RhiTalia,t5_3e8dw,thyroidcancer,t1_i7s0fbn,6,i7sp250,"All cancers are “treatable”. Even palliative care is a treatment. Do you mean curable? 

Can we stop saying that one type of Papillary Carcinoma = all thyroid cancer? It’s incredibly insensitive and disrespectful to the thyroid cancer patients with other types of thyroid cancer. Some even with papillary could have variants that make treatment more challenging. Imagine hearing “the good kind!” from someone they’ve just told and then they have to explain that it’s the bad kind of “good kind”, or less good kind of “good kind”.",t3_ukj0ct,t1_i7sp250,2022-05-08 13:50:04,/r/thyroidcancer/comments/ukj0ct/favorite_responses_to_telling_people_you_have/i7sp250/,r/thyroidcancer,,
