            "Emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis Hello, We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have. Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help. Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

            "Anticipatory Grief for my dad My dad was diagnosed with head and neck cancer nearly 10 years ago, which was treated surgically and with radiotherapy as he was unsuitable for Chemo. We've had 5 years cancer-free. That's a lot, I know that. He has other health issues but it's still been 5 years more with my dad, and for him with his grandson. About a month ago he had some tests and they have confirmed the cancer is back and has local metastasis into the soft palette and lymph nodes. They can't do more radio, chemo is still a no-no and he has basically 0 chance of survival for the only surgical option, which would be a minimum of 19hrs on the table, with only a small chance at success, so he was put into the palliative care program. They have so far only given a loose estimate: 'it won't be days or weeks, but it won't be years'. I think I adjusted to that. But now, just a few weeks later, I'm not sure they won't change it. He can barely eat (living on the shakes and occasional yogurt), he's lethargic and agitated. I'm watching the weight drop off of him. Every day I go in and he looks more jaundiced. He is in constant pain and I can see the sadness in his eyes and the way he sits... My family is so bad at this all. Normally when a relative dies I'm the one who is there for people, like with my grandparents, even my folks came to me because I was the most 'okay'. I love my family and I love looking after them. But this time idk how to. I'm an only child for all intents and purposes, with a young son of my own to watch over through this one, and of course my mum. But I'm not sure I'm strong enough. For the first time, I don't know how to be. I want so badly to go to him right now and hug him, but my family isn't a big one for PDA and I just CAN NOT add to his sadness by making him think I won't be okay. But it's all I want in the world. To hold him and tell him I'll be okay after I'm not, and he doesn't need to worry and that I love him. But I think it would break him. I feel guilty for holding that back, from him and my mum. For holding in the worry but I can't tell them, because I want to be okay for both of them. I don't want them to be alone. To top it off, outside of this my life is better than it has been for a while, and I feel guilty when I go out and enjoy myself. I feel bad for letting go of what is otherwise a constant ball of sadness and worry and loneliness. I'm fine most of the time but then I go in to spend time with him and see how much he's faded in a few days, or watch him in pain when he even tries to talk, watching that sadness and that fear wash over his face... Mostly I'm fine. But when I'm not, I am REALLY not. I find myself grieving to the point of exhaustion. I'm tired just from emotions and we're not even confirmed to be that close to the time. I am not sure how to hold on, but I don't ever want to have to let go. There's so much I want to say to him, and I don't know how without breaking down and making it worse for him, so I don't. I don't know where to turn or what to do, other than come here and post a mile-long message of things I can't say out loud or to anyone who knows me and hope that someone, somewhere, feels the same. I don't need answers, I think I just need to not be alone in being the fixer, in needing to be strong and fine for everyone who needs me, even if to do that I need to sometimes go out and let that side of me go so I can recharge.\n",
            "Doctor Refuses to Acknowledge Dad Needs Palliative or Hospice Care [Question] My dad is currently in the hospital with stage IV renal cell carcinoma with brain metastasis, bone metastasis and fluid on his lung that is related to his cancer. He also has severe malnutrition, dehydration and is unable to walk. He was on a chemo pill, went through multiple rounds of radiation and had one Keytruda immunotherapy before being admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath related to the fluid on his lung. His oncologist visited him in the hospital and recommended that he be moved to a rehabilitation hospital so that he can “get better before we restart treatment”. I’m optimistic but I also realize that with his advanced cancer he will probably not get better enough to start treatment. I just want him to have the best quality of life possible and I have requested palliative care multiple times but the doctor has balked at the idea each time. It feels like the doctor refuses to acknowledge reality and I don’t want him to die in suffering when palliative and hospice care is available. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this again with his oncologist?\n",
            "Palliative care concurrent with treatment? Hello. I’ve lurked here casually for a while but this is a first post in this sub, my apologies for length and if similar posts are available (search was no help). My dad was diagnosed 7 years ago with colon and bladder cancer. The bladder cancer was removed and has not recurred to our knowledge. The colon cancer has persisted and he’s had a spot on his lungs for the last few years as well. He is 69. Last month his doctor raised the possibility of stopping the chemo because it doesn’t seem to be working anymore and his Pet scan shows some new spots and growth in old spots, plus his CEA has been rising. My dad is adamant that he will fight to the end and said no, he wants to try another chemo. So the new drug started two weeks ago. It’s seriously kicking his ass. It was apparent almost immediately that he is too weak to have this drug on a regular basis for the full course. He can’t sleep due to mystery pain in his back, then he could no longer use his right arm due to mystery pain in his shoulder. He has stopped eating altogether, except for cannabis edibles. On bad days he sleeps most of the day and doesn’t really move much. On good days he seems happy to see us and sits in his chair most of the time, but always there is pain and fatigue. Within the last two weeks he can no longer drive or dress himself. It’s been a very sudden and shocking decline after 7 years of on and off chemo and a relatively decent quality of life, playing with grandkids, going on trips, etc. My mom is losing it. He refuses to talk to her about anything, let her come to appointments with him, or make any kind of arrangements for the future: financial, medical, logistical plans are non-existent. She has no idea what his prognosis is or how to deal with any of this. He is not accepting the reality of what’s happening, and I’m trying to be understanding and not push him and cause an argument. But it’s clear this new drug is a drastic change in quality of life. It feels unsustainable. He refuses all pain medication except the cannabis, which doesn’t appear to even be touching the pain he’s in right now. He has taken oral painkillers in the past and didn’t like how he felt, so now he won’t take anything. His hospital offers palliative care concurrent with treatment. So he doesn’t have to stop chemo and can get some help with all of this. It feels like we’re losing precious time because he won’t ask for help with his symptoms. Is there any way to broach the subject with him? I know this may seem random but maybe someone will understand: he’s a Vietnam veteran (army infantry drafted 1969-1970), and his general temperament and stress responses are all affected by a decent amount of post traumatic stress and a general distrust of humanity and authority. He is also stubborn and fiercely independent and always has been. He is likely to see palliative care as “giving up” and the thing that people do when there’s no hope left. He may respond better to me than to my mom (or really anyone) if I can find a way to bring it up lovingly at the right time. I understand everyone is different but can anyone share their experience helping a loved one come to terms with new realities and make the adjustment? Any insight into palliative care alongside treatment? I’m just figuring this out as I go and I’ve only started looking into what palliative care is in the last few days. Thanks all\n",
            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 9 >> How do I tell my dad that the doctors are giving up hope? My dad has stage 4 thymus/lung cancer. It's spread to both lungs, and my dad is having difficulties breathing. He can still walk, and still has somewhat of an appetite. English isn't his first language, and I normally go to doctor visits with him. He was diagnosed last year in April, and since then he's had countless chemo, and radiation treatments. He had brain surgery last year in December, and the doctors were surprised with how fast he recovered. Things were looking up for a bit. He had hopw. Then he was put on immunotherapy, which didn't work. From July of this year, he's gotten progressively worse. Yesterday was the first time visiting palliative care dr. The thing is, he doesn't understand that its the end of the road treatment. I think that both him and my mum know that the cancer is incurable, but they still hold onto the hope. They think that palliative care is just another treatment to help decrease the size of cancer. When they asked me, I said it was just a doctor who prescribed medicine. I can't bring myself to tell them. My dad's still undergoing chemo as a last ditch effort to decrease the rate the tumours are growing. How do I tell him that the doctors are nearly giving up? I tried to suggest him get his affairs in order. Write a will maybe. He just said that he wants to wait until he gets better. I'm not sure if he'll get better than this. He wants to fight, and I want to see him fight.. but it's a loosing battle. I don't know what he would do if I told him this .\n",
            "My dad's cancer came back. I got news yesterday that my dad's cancer has metastasized to his liver. He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2017 at the age of 47. He underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, got a colostomy, was operated on in feb2018 to remove the tennis ball sized tumour, and has subsequently been living with an ileostomy. Doctors were very happy with the treatment and surgery, he was a fucking champion throughout. All signs removed. I took for granted that it hadn't made its way into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. His first round of post treatment check-ups and there are spots in his liver. I know that metastatic cancer is a different ballpark and it's fucking bothering me. I know all of the treatments hit harder than he expected but he grit his teeth and got through it, but he sounds understandably depressed, dejected and unsure of whether he can/wants to stomach more treatment. I know the liver is a shit one (aren't they all though, really). I know that we have to wait for more tests and this and that, and to see what treatments he can opt for etc. I know the university in this city has a strong medical research in other illnesses so perhaps there is hope there. But above all else I know this is a numbers game and the odds of him getting out of the woods are shit. I know that the number of variables that we have to rely on lining up in his favour are out-fucking-standing. I know that realistically this is going to be a palliative rather than curative situation. He's only 48 years old. Never smoked, not a drinker. Fit and strong as an ox. I thought we were done with this shit, I thought he was fine. I totally took it for granted. Surgery was successful it's all over. I know. I'll be strong for him, I'll hype him up and help him out. Im just fucking devastated. I don't want to lose my dad I'm fucking 24 and he is the biggest inspiration I've ever had. He inspired me to turn my life around, and I want him to see me graduate. He was hopeful about having his ileostomy removed as the colon was successfully patched up and nervous tissue was still there. Maybe if the doctors had taken it seriously these liver spots could have been seen earlier in scans for the ileostomy reversal. Then again, that's the least of his problems right now. \n",

My dad (64 years old) was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer with mets to his liver in September 2021. He is very frail and has severe lower back pain and has trouble breathing. The pain coupled with frequent bathroom visits have made for many sleepless nights that have caused his overall health to diminish. I absolutely hate to see him suffer like this and I really wish that there was more I could do. He is starting palliative chemotherapy (Folfox) in a few days and I was wondering if anyone has any advice to aid my father in feeling more comfortable. Thank you in advance, I have found great solace in reading posts from this group throughout my dad’s diagnosis.

Like the title says, my dad has non small cell lung cancer and is metastatic in bones and liver. We found out mid Jane, and they said he had 6 mos to live. He's a 100% disabled vet, and all his care for last 25 years has been with the VA. I have mixed feelings about them over all, but the people in critical care have been very supportive. Things have escalated very quickly. Before his first chemo treatment they said he was too weak for it. He's now on high flow oxygen and we found out last week he won't be coming home. He's been confused, but has been able to talk and hold a conversation up until Saturday night. He is in a tremendous amount of pain, can't talk, and pain medication they have him on doesn't seem to be enough. Palliative care is double booked and they're trying to get him into there or hospice, but they're waiting for him to be in less pain because he won't have a sitter in hospice. That doesn't exactly make sense to me, because they said he'll be in less pain in palliative care! Just don't know what to believe or think. Meanwhile he is suffering, and it's so hard to sit back and feel like you can't do anything. This sucks. I wouldn't wish this on my worse enemy. If you read this, thanks for listening.

He was in hospital until last week but is now at home lying in bed. He has no energy at all, so the planned chemotherapy didn't even start. Now nothing can be done other than palliative care. It's been 3 days he didnt drink or eat anything (he didnt eat much before that either). He hasn't been on the toilet for a week now. He's lying in bed all day. He doesn't have the power to even talk. And everytime I ask him if he wants something to eat, he gets really angry and tells me that all he wants is to die. He is and always was a really stubborn person. It's hard. For him as well as my mom and me (28). Just until 2 months ago he seemed perfectly healthy and sane. I don't know what else to say. Cancer sucks.\n",

            "My mom died last week at 54 of metastatic cancer... she hid the stage. I need help processing Like the title says, my mom died last week at the age of 54 of metastatic breast cancer. She was diagnosed about a year ago in a routine mammogram and at the time told me that her doctor couldn't assign a stage to it (which I thought was weird but she said it was just a tumor in her breast and her prognosis was good, needed chemo then a mastectomy). We live far apart right now but we are close and speak almost every day - and I saw her every few months. She's not someone who wanted people talking to her all the time about cancer- she waited several months after diagnosis to tell other family and friends. I tried to strike a balance between checking in on that specifically and having normal conversations. &amp;#x200B; It seemed to me she hit every roadblock imaginable on her cancer journey- she lost TONS of weight, surgery got delayed and delayed and delayed. We were all worried about her, and after some encouraging she got a second opinion at MD Anderson about 6 months ago but decided to stick with her oncologist. &amp;#x200B; Then she seemed to start feeling worse. I thought it was due to a year of nonstop chemo but that surgery would be very soon. But then she got pneumonia about a month ago. She was hospitalized for about a week and then released. That was a turning point- she seemed diminished after that. &amp;#x200B; She had chemo two Fridays ago. Then, the next night, she woke up and started yelling 'help me' and my dad's name. She couldn't tell he was holding her- she was delirious. He rushed her to the emergency room, where she had to be sedated. She had gone into multisystem organ failure. Scans at the ER showed the cancer had spread to her bones, lungs, brain and liver. She was put on a ventilator in a hope to help with something, but the doctors then advised that it wasn't survivable, and recommended turning the ventilator off. &amp;#x200B; I got on a plane and rushed to be there. I told her I loved her and held her hand while they ended life support. It all happened so fast. &amp;#x200B; Then my dad found the medical records with her original diagnosis, hidden in their closet. She was diagnosed at stage 4. It had already spread from her breast to her lymph nodes, bones and liver at the time she was diagnosed. My dad didn't even know the extent of it- she had been very private about her appointments so he let her decide where he went with her. &amp;#x200B; I don't know if she just kept the gravity of the situation from us because she wanted to be treated as normal as possible, or if she was deeply in denial or what. There were notes from her doctors that they were concerned she wasn't processing the diagnosis. But my mom and I had planned the whole time that I would take a month off of work and come stay when she got her mastectomy, partially to spend time together and partially so I could help her and my dad. She seemed to be looking forward to that- I of course would have been there at any time if I knew it was stage four and there might never be surgery. &amp;#x200B; My dad demanded to go to her last chemo appointment with her, because he had gotten really worried about her- she was super weak. Her doctor apparently brought up to her for the first time that they at some point might need to change their focus to palliative care, but that they'd see how this new chemo went for a while. She said she didn't want to give up and didn't want to die. But she was dead, 48 hours later. &amp;#x200B; On top of the devastation that I'll never talk to her again- which I can't even start to comprehend yet- it is agony thinking about what she must have been through. It's pretty clear she suffered. But was she afraid? Did she worry we'd find out about the truth and be mad at her? Did she understand how serious this was, or was she in a sort of blissful denial? &amp;#x200B; I am heartbroken. I sincerely apologize if this is not the right place for this post. Cancer is so cruel.\n",
            "My Mum Passed a Week Ago My mum recently passed to a rare metastasised clear cell cancer after a two year battle with normal and experimental treatment. I made sure she spent as much time at home as possible before she had to palliative care where she deteriorated so quickly. I was with her during her second last day, stayed the night and most of her last day. I couldn’t stop crying for those past 5 days while she was there. She waited for everyone to come see her and she passed alone, we missed it by 20 minutes but we think she didn’t want to show us her going. I’m only 23 and there’s so much to do and organise especially without a will, we have a supportive family and work place who supported us with the funeral. Though we are going have to move out since the house I live with her in is to expensive. What I’m worried about though is that I haven’t cried since she was alive, I’m upset but I haven’t been able to, maybe it’s because I’m more relieved that she’s not suffering anymore.\n",
            "An odd rant (but need to get it off my chest) My mom was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer in January. They caught it at Stage IV and her prognosis is 2-6 months. She's undergoing palliative chemo and nobody knows she's dying except me. &amp;#x200B; She's only 50 and I'm in my late 20s, but no other adult in my family speaks English fluently enough to navigate this mess. She nods when the oncologist uses a translator to tell her about her health, but she still thinks that curative surgery is the end goal. Dad is also under the impression that they'll reevaluate her for curative surgery after the chemo. You can't cure this type of cancer and my family hasn't figured that out yet. &amp;#x200B; I'm okay with taking care of my mom, but she is also the reason why I had an abusive childhood and spent the last 4 years in therapy. Mom has always made it clear that I was a mistake and regrets having me. She was a young mother and didn't know how to handle herself, much less a child. I've been taking care of myself since I was 9 years old, and at 13, I was taking care of her second child. I bailed from the household as soon as I was able to and have had minimal contact with the family since. Now I see them every week. &amp;#x200B; Dad has never had to parent a day of his life and doesn't speak a lick of English. He's told mom that if she panics, he will panic harder. When mom passes, I'll have to manage the household bills and paperwork. There will be houses and bank accounts in my name and I don't want any of it. &amp;#x200B; The only other family member I have is a 14 year old sister. She speaks English and suffers from teenage depression. She knows mom has cancer, but she doesn't know how dire the situation is. She had a much better childhood than I did (second time's the charm), so mom is her friend. It'd break her heart to know that mom's dying. &amp;#x200B; It's only been 5 weeks since the start of her treatment, but all of the paperwork, phone calls, and making decisions on my mom's behalf has been exhausting. I need to keep her alive for as long as possible for my sister's sake. I need to put on a brave face so the rest of the family still has hope. When she passes, I will inherit a family that I had previously intentionally cut ties with. &amp;#x200B; I went to a support group last week for caretakers and everyone had stories about how much they loved the person they were taking care of. I feel guilty for not feeling love. All I feel is responsibility. What is wrong with me?\n",
            "First Dad, now Mom.... I don't have anything specific to ask, just wanted to vent. 2014 was a shitty year. My Dad had prostate cancer a decade ago, was in remission. I was 14 when he was first diagnosed, and things turned out fine, so I hardly thought about the fact that my Dad had cancer. Then early 2014 it came back, with a 10 month diagnosis to live. The fall and winter sucked seeing him deteriorate and go into palliative care. He passed in Feb 2015. Then just before Christmas, my Mom got a breast cancer diagnosis. My understanding is it was caught earlier, and signs are looking positive for her. She started chemo Friday, and Tuesday had to go to emergency due to a bad reaction to chemo. She stayed that night and tonight in the hospital, I'm just hoping she's better and gets to go home tomorrow. All I've heard is that her cancer has a positive diagnosis, unlike my Dad's recent one. But it's just so hard seeing her drugged out on morphine, laying Ina hospital bed, bringing back memories of my Dad dieing in palliative care. I almost don't want to go see her, because I've had enough of hospitals and seeing parents weak and dieing in a god damn fucking hospital bed. But I have to see her, to keep her strong and to avoid any regrets. Is there anything that can make this easier? All I can think is that I'm now losing my Mom too. At 26 this is bullshit, I want to have kids and have grandparents in their lives and now that probably won't happen\n",
            "Loved one with terminal cancer and extreme depression. My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer 18 months ago. It was deemed inoperable and she received palliative chemo and radiation therapy. She's in relatively good health still, but is simply waiting for it to go south. She has been understandably very depressed, but recently she's showing signs of severe depression. She constantly talks about death, the mistakes she made in life, how horrible her father's cancer was, contemplating the ways she'll end her life when the cancer worsens. She's lashing out at my sister and dad, who live with her and who are in denial that her cancer is terminal. It's very worrying. She's receiving care at one of the best cancer treatment clinics in the state. They have incredible mental health resources including free individual and group therapy sessions with counselors specifically trained to help terminal cancer patients. I keep gently pushing her to take advantage of these services, but my mom absolutely refuses to talk to anyone. Her excuses are \"what the hell would a 20-something fresh out of college know about death?\" and \"What's the point? I'm going to die soon anyway.\" She's been saying this type of thing for 18 months. Ironically, before the cancer she saw a therapist for depression for years and has, or had, faith in the effectiveness of counselling. She also takes antidepressants. I can't force her to go to a therapist and she is ignoring my pleas and those of my sister and dad. I live in another state and make regular visits. Every time i come down she's in a worse state. I don't know what to do or say that could make her feel better, or at least seek out professional help. Meanwhile she's spiralling downward, refusing to leave the house and spending the last good months (years?) of her life in misery. What can I do, if anything? (Sorry if this has been asked before. I searched the archives and couldn't find anything about helping loved ones with cancer-related depression.)\n",
            "Mum has cancer... Last year my mum had her 3rd diagnosis of breast cancer alongside secondary bone cancer. She recently finished her chemotherapy for this but last month she found out that it had spread once again but this time to her brain. She has had radiation therapy and is now having chemotherapy - she looks so poorly and is having many side effects; double vision, can barely walk, nose bleeds, tiredness etc. She has also now gone cross eyed. The side effects are a lot worse than when she was having chemotherapy previously. My mum will just not talk to me about it, she doesn't want me to worry but it's too late for that. I have tried asking her how bad it is but she just gets angry and refuses to answer which makes me think that it's very bad. I also saw that on some of her paperwork she is having palliative treatment and that they are not trying to cure the cancer. Work are being very supportive and it is a great distraction however I have been feeling very overwhelmed and keep thinking that she is going to die. I know that all I can do is be there for her and be strong for her especially as she is so overwhelmed herself. I am just finding it difficult that I do not know the full extent of her diagnosis and I would rather know if she didn't have much time left. Thank you if you read all of this, I just needed to get it out. \n",

            "Metastatic Breast Cancer Hi! Cassidy here. I am a 26-year-old originally from Ontario, Canada, recently moved to Quebec with my boyfriend and mother in tow. March 16th, 2020, my mom was diagnosed in the ER with Metastatic breast cancer, spread to her lungs, spine, pelvis, ribs, neck, and the lining of her brain. It was a shock diagnosis, but not really at the same time. I have spent years caring for her in different ways with her PTSD and depression issues. She tends to refuse help from most doctors, or at least, the preventative care required to avoid problems from getting worse. The reason I bring this up is that I almost felt caring for her in this sense would be my inevitable future, and I feel as though I grieved the women my mother once was, many years ago. My mother raised me and my brother as a mostly single parent. My absentee father spent the majority of his time working hours away, and only coming home on weekends to clean the pool and see his friends. She did a wonderful job given the circumstances, and when my parents inevitably divorced, I chose to stay with her full time. She has been my rock growing up, always proud, always boastful. She is kind and caring, and incredibly selfless with her children. I always imagined my adult life littered with phone calls for advice on my marriage and how to raise my own children right, and then I was hit with this diagnosis. The last five months have been nothing short of life-changing. I have limited support from my brother, as he is busy co-parenting with his ex-wife and working full-time as a Police Officer during a global pandemic. I try not to blame him for his lack of availability and willingness to help, but I can openly admit that I feel frustrated at him for not doing more. Upon diagnosis, we had a rough initial week. My mom has lived alone for years, about 15 minutes away from me. I took her home from the hospital that night with a pharmacy of her own to get her pain under control, some food for a few days, and a long list of phone numbers to get started making appointments. I quickly realized this would continue on for what she has left of her life, for me to handle. That week was littered with scans, new doctors, and hours of driving to Newmarket to begin talking treatment plan. I think the stress got to her, and a few days were spent hopping in an ambulance to the hospital as she was in so much pain she could not wait for me to drive her. She was diagnosed with stage 4, with limited options for treatment aside from pain control a hormone-blocking drug to slow the growth of the cancer cells. She was given access to a palliative care doctor to help manage her pain, which to say the least, I have not been impressed with. Although the doctor puts on a polite facade, she seems to ignore the things that to me, are signs of the end of life and I am left feeling like I have no resources and no options. As I am her legal caregiver, my only option was to have her move with me to QC as she has no one else to assist, and I had already signed my mortgage prior to her diagnosis. I held the move off as long as possible, to ensure she could benefit from as much treatment in ON as possible before we got here. None of her doctors will give us a time frame, but my research shows that that cancer in the lining of her brain is an end-stage progression, and we most likely will not see more than a year. Her doctors, on the other hand, seem to believe that if she just stays in a positive mindset, she could see 2-10 years. Which to me is unrealistic given her condition. I feel lost. I am 26, a first time home buyer, hoping to continue on with life as expected for someone my age, and I am struggling to do so given what I feel is science vs spirit. In recent days, she is very forgetful and confused, she has lost over 60 pounds, she sleeps 12-18 hours a day, gets sick after most meals or snacks, and is so weak she can barely make it up the stairs. Trying to cope with the diagnoses, and the harsh reality of losing my mom before she gets to see me get married or have children is crushing, but the unknown of what to look for, when to put her in hospice, and who to talk to makes it much worse. I find myself battling emotions of anger and frustration vs. happiness and joy to spend these last moments with her. The unknown is killing me.\n",

            "Helping a loved one with coping? Hi, I've posted a few times here and this community has been really supportive - thanks for all of the good advice and positive vibes. My mother-in-law was told yesterday that she's essentially under \"palliative care\" at this point. She just started radiation (Monday of last week), as well as regularly taking Xeloda (started yesterday). On Monday they informed her that the cancer did spread to her bones, which is why she's been having aches. My wife is taking this all pretty hard, understandably, and is pretty much going through grieving now (although for the time being her mother is fairly healthy and capable, only she gets tired pretty quickly). Is there any advice for what I can do to help her cope, or what she can do herself? \n",
            "Help to comfort someone moving into hospice My mother (69) was diagnosed with brain cancer a little less than a month ago. I don't want to go into full details of the tests she received but she refused biopsy, and she also refuses all treatments. Doctor told us last week she has glioblastoma and has only a few weeks left to live. She doesn't know her prognostic and refuses to be made aware of it. After many discussions my mother has decided she would like to go into hospice care. She needs someone with her 24/7 and she refuses to have friends and extended family come over to csre for her. There is a nice home for palliative care in her town so I think she will be comfortable there. My question is : what can we do to make her stay there as happy, comfortable, and easy as possible? Are there some things you wish you knew afterwards or that you did or saw that made an impact of your loved one? I am already bringing pictures of the kids, comfy pyjamas, her favorite hand cream. And of course I intend to visit often. Anything else I should think about? My mother is still lucid, she can talk but stays in bed almost all day. She gets up to eat, go to the bathroom and get herself washed.\n",
            "Best way to support, love, and avoid regrets but also maintain sanity? I’m visiting with my parents this weekend, and as of this past Tuesday it’s official: her stage 4 NSCLC (which had been relatively inactive following immunotherapy she had to quit due to an extreme reaction) now involves malignant pleural effusion. My parents are both living in a “beat this” bubble, which I honestly want to be in as well. They’re overly surprised and shocked by each new symptom and its severity and are sure another drug will come through to do the trick. I want so badly for that to be true, but I see how much weight she’s lost. How hard it is for her to breathe. How despite them talking new, crazy treatments her (fantastic) oncologist is talking back to chemo, maybe just palliative care. I am trying to match their positivity and enthusiasm and I am crying when I am alone. They don’t even want me to stay beyond the weekend visit because “oh it’s not that bad, haha”, despite the fact that they were talking hospital earlier. I don’t know what to do with my mom if I only have months, or weeks, or even days left. I don’t know how to tell her how much she means to me without making her mad or sad or upset that I don’t believe she’ll beat it. I want to go curl up in a bed with her like a kid again but I don’t want to make her sad. I don’t even know what advice there is that would help, I just kind of needed to get this out there to avoid a full blown freak out. I keep reminding myself she’s here and she feels not too bad and I’m just trying to do what it takes, whatever it takes for her to be happy and comfy and not feel alone. So, If you do have advice, I would really appreciate it, if not I just really appreciate the ability to put this out there to people who may understand it. I just feel so selfish and childish for not being able to join the hope filled world they’ve built. Harsh responses are totally ok by me, I probably could use the kick in the pants.\n",
            "Need some advice for dealing a stubborn terminal parent Hi, everyone, Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this. If it's not, please let me know and I'll direct it to the right one. We have a complicated situation. My mom, 64, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in October 2014. They didn't expect her to live past a year. But she responded well to palliative chemo and immunotherapy and has survived the past three years with tons of ups and downs. The trend is slowly downwards, however, to the point where she's now quite weak. She sleeps for days at a time and generally doesn't do more than watch television. She's an incredibly strong woman with an iron will, which has gotten her this far in life. That iron will means she is also incredibly stubborn. She has 100% refused hospice care of any kind because \"they just want to pump you full of drugs and kill you as fast as possible\". She refuses to give up smoking; she still sucks down at least a pack a day despite being barely able to breath even at a rest. She refuses oxygen because it means she can't smoke. She has been unbelievably depressed for the past three years, but absolutely refuses to talk to any of the free counselors at the hospital because \"what the fuck does a 26-year-old social worker know about life?\" I have offered to locate and pay for private counselling with a social worker or therapist who is closer to her age and who specializes in terminal cancer patients. She has refused this as well, because \"what's the point? I'm going to be dead soon anyway.\" She refuses to eat anything except for candy. She refuses to drink anything except tea and Diet Pepsi. She refuses to stay in bed, insisting she get up to make tea for herself or go get soda. She has fallen a number of times over the past six months, causing all kinds of terrifying but fortunately non-life-threatening injuries. At this point she's so tired most of the time that she falls asleep mid-sentence or will fall asleep standing up. We'll put her to bed when she's almost like a zombie from fatigue. A half-hour later she'll be up and staggering around the kitchen, dropping coffee mugs and ash trays. When we insist she go to bed and that we'll get her anything she wants, she gets very angry, saying it's not our place to boss her around and SHE CAN DO IT HERSELF. Lather, rinse, repeat until she finally passes out. My sister and my father live at home with her and take care of her. I make frequent trips home to help relieve them. On top of all this, their house is a gigantic disaster area because mom used to clean and tidy everything and my dad and my sister simply don't know how to care for themselves. My parents' extremely dysfunctional relationship stalled an ambitious renovation they started 13 years ago. So the house is only half-finished and is like a giant, filthy hoarder's den. It's one massive trip hazard for even a healthy person, let alone a late-stage cancer patient who is unsteady on her feet. Our strategy has just been to entertain her whims and keep her safe and happy until she's too sick to fight going into hospice. Thing is, mom's cancer is spreading really slowly. Her oncologist said she's actually quite healthy in that regard. No tumors in any major organs or in her brain, only her lungs and in some other small non-vital areas. She could very well go on living for another year, maybe even two years. Who knows? In the meantime, she will fight tooth-and-nail for her independence. But it will inevitably end up with her falling asleep with a lit cigarette in bed, falling and breaking a hip, or some other disaster that will affect us all. My mom was actually a great person before all of this. But the disease has morphed someone very dedicated and focused into a bitter, angry woman in total denial about her frailty. We all love her very much and we understand her anger, but she refuses to come to terms with her illness. It's destroying our family. My sister and dad are exhausted and angry all of the time. They overeat junk food and their general health is in the toilet (Dad has developed diabetes. They both barely sleep). I've developed a stress-related illness because of three years of relentless ups and downs. We're all guiltily hoping she dies soon so this ugly situation just finally ends. This is a horrible situation that none of us are equipped to handle. We don't know where to turn. What do we do? Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any advice is greatly appreciated. **TL;DR** Mom is slowly dying of lung cancer, refuses to come to terms with it. It's destroying our family and putting her at unnecessary risk. Help.\n",
            "My mom is dying and has weeks left.. My mom gave a good hard fight to stage 4 met breast cancer over the last 7 years. It spread to her liver, lungs, spine and ovaries, and most recently her brain. About 6 weeks ago we found out there is not much more to do as her brain mets has spread too deep. Surgery is too risky and would likely paralyze her completely. Since then, her treatment has ended and she has been at home in palliative care up until two weeks ago when we transferred her to hospice. It became too difficult to care for her at home (she has very little function physically, and her husband has been incredibly difficult - trying to bar myself and two siblings from being with her in their room, yelling at us, etc.). As her health POA it was in her best interest to move her to neutral and peaceful ground in hospice care. Which she hates. The staff and the hospice itself is wonderful, but for her it's not home. The transition for her has, of course, been difficult. The brain mets is all pushing on her frontal lobe, so there is a lot of anger and agitation my siblings and I take the brunt of (biting, screaming, sweating, etc). We totally understand and hate that this is how it has to be. I'm at a loss, I don't know how to try and keep her somewhat happy (like who would be happy in this?). Going through photo albums and chatting about our day to day to try and stimulate her results in sadness and anger. I feel like all we do now is watch TV and eat her favourite foods together (she is on steroids for the brain mets and still has a decent appetite but even that is dwindling). Which is fine, but I feel like it's not enough and feel like a shitty daughter for not being able to make her happy - which I was very good at when she was more lucid. I want to try and make her last moments as pleasant and loving as possible - but she gets so angry and agitated at everything I feel like nothing is working. They've given her sedatives and what not to even her out a bit but you can just see in her eyes how sad she is. I don't know what to do. For anyone who's gotten this far, thanks for taking the time to read. Any advice would be so appreciated. \n",

(Stage 4 Colon cancer with mets to liver and lung) Hey guys, First of all I am genuinely proud of everyone in this subreddit for sharing their stories and trying to help one other! Thanks for that.The reason I am here, is because of my mother ( born in may 1951) She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2014. She got radiotherapy, followed by (oral: tablets) chemotherapy. After reducing the tumor to a smaller size, she got an operation. During this process, the doctors saw an abnormality in her liver. She then got a second operation in which they also removed the (metastasized) tumor in her liver. So that was that, and they declared her to be \"cured\" from cancer. Fast forward to 2017. She got a heavy cough for almost a month, when we went to the doctors for her semi-annual controls, they diagnosed her with stage 4 colon cancer with metastasis in her left lung, and some small dots in her liver. The colon was clear of cancer. The doctors said curing was not possible anymore, so they started the traject of palliative therapy. * She first got 5-FU, it didn't help. * Then she got irinotecan from 26/2/19 till end of may 2019. She reacted VERY heavily, lots of diarrhea. The CT-scans showed no significant difference. So the doctors said they wanted to try something different * They tried Panitumumab. It's an EGFR- inhibitor and not regular chemo. She got intense rash on her face, but the first CT-scan (after 4 treatments) showed enormous differences. The tumor in her liver and lung shrunk significantly and we were all happy something finally seemed to work. Up until they made a second CT-scan (again after 4 treatments with panitumumab). The tumor markers were higher in her blood and the tumor in her liver showed some growth (the lung is stable). Here comes the reason why I'm here. According to this second CT-scan the doctors told us that there is nothing left that they can do. They basically cancelled ALL future appointments and told us they won't make any new scans or do anything, unless my mom gets new complaints, like heavy pain. They will then ONLY help reducing the pain, but nothing more than that. I think this is insane. My mom is 68, she has a stable weight, is not underweight , nor super overweight (161 cm long and weighs around 72 kg), she can walk, she can talk, she can basically still do a lot of things. Yes she is tired faster than before and has bellyaches everyday. But from the outside you would not say that my mom is a stage 4 cancer patient. I don't get how the doctors are giving up on her, while she is still so fit? I mean i understand she is not curable, but why don't they try something else? She has rheumatoid arthritis, they can't treat her with immunotherapy. But I've searched the web and research articles and I've found out about combination therapy where they give an EGFR- inhibitor combined with chemo (like cetuximab + irinotecan; it happens to help with patients who are not responding to irinotecan alone). Or they could give her a VEFG-inhibitor like Bevacuzimab (in combination with chemotherapy).There is also a new study about metastasized colon cancer (BEACON STUDY (in Dutch) ([https://www.avl.nl/nieuwsberichten/2019/nieuwe-combitherapie-biedt-darmkankerpati%C3%ABnt-extra-behandelkeuze/](https://www.avl.nl/nieuwsberichten/2019/nieuwe-combitherapie-biedt-darmkankerpati%C3%ABnt-extra-behandelkeuze/)) done recently which resulted in a combination therapy of a BRAF-inhibitor and EGFR-inhibitor or a BRAF-inhibitor, MEK-inhibitor and a EGFR-inhibitor. I'm wondering why don't they try something like that? So now I have a phone-appointment with her doctor tomorrow. I really want to convince her in not giving up on treatment for my mom. All I could find is written above, so now I'm asking you guys. Do you know anything else (like therapy or something else), which I can discuss with and suggest to the doctor? Are there any people who recognize themselves in this trajectory and found something else that helped them? I feel so desperate and anxious at the same time. I really don't want to accept that this is the end of everything. Thanks for reading this, and I wish you all the best! &amp;#x200B; * maybe it's good to tell that we live in the Netherlands and the BEACON study is done at the same hospital as my mom is/was receiving her treatments (that's why I also don't understand why they did not suggest giving her that treatment as a fourth option).\n",

Hey all - need some help with this as I am not too sure how to handle it. **Background** My mum has an incurable form of cancer. We are on the last chemo drug with a low response rate. The oncologists has said that other options are unlikely to be effective. It is VERY obvious that the current one isn't working (visible tumors still growing). I heard my mum expressing to her friends that this is like issuing a death sentence to her and she is just waiting for death. She has some glimmer of hope that maybe if we see another oncologist for a second opinion, there could be a solution. I browsed the medical literature online - there is simply no cure for this so even if somehow another drug can be used, it will merely prolong her live (and not cure the cancer). We discussed stem cell transplant with the oncologist who said that it would not work on my mum because the cancer is not even under control + the high mortality risk associated with such a procedure. **Question** At some point, whatever hope my mother has would disappear. Was wondering if you all have thoughts on how I can soften the blow? I have read threads on this subreddit where upon being told that chemo no longer works, a patient just loses all hope and deteriorates rapidly (can't find that post but it will always stay at the back of my mind). I have tried introducing the possibility that nothing will work by saying the following: * \"even if there are no treatment options, that will not be the end, they will continue to treat your symptoms to make sure you are well taken care of\" * I have also began introducing the term \"palliative doctors\" and encouraging her to think about what she wants \"more chemo + poor quality of life or no further treatment + managing symptoms\". So far she seems to have taken them well but what just unsettles me is when she said \"at least I am still undergoing chemo\" which indicates to me that she is still clinging on to some hope that it may work. Thank you for reading my post.\n",

My mom found out that she has stage 4 adenocarcinoma yesterday, unknown primary, large mets in spine and liver (the spinal one is particularly large). The only thing conventional medicine can offer her is palliative care (radiation) to reduce to size of the tumor encroaching on her spine--there is no cure, and the doctors are saying there's no current treatment option for her liver met. To complicate matters, my mother has been battling severe depression for years, worsened by the death of her partner this past June, and her mental state appears inexorably linked to feeling \"trapped\" in her current situation (I have a hunch that it was the somatic effects of grief that allowed the cancer to become so serious so quickly). When the tumors were discovered last week, the first thing that happened was this: her brother booked her a one way ticket to California. He lives out there and says that he has a number of friends who have cured themselves using alternative therapies, from juicing to vitamin dosing, to something called \"black salve\". I'm especially nervous about them trying to use the latter; the other alternative therapies are from a[ woman who was successful with her own cancer:](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rid-Yourself-of-Cancer/542922805760288).

I know from lurking on this sub for a couple of days that most people feel negatively about alternative therapies. I guess I'm looking for any advice for those who have been at this stage with their loved ones--what did you do, what helped, what made things worse? tl;dr: My mom is terminal and so she's headed to California in hopes that it will offer better quality of life as well resources for alternative therapies.

I was diagnosed with a rare sarcoma 3 years ago at the age of 27. Had surgery (tumor was in my face, so lost lots of teeth and mildly disfigured--which was initially devastating but I've come to accept). Did an entire year (14 cycles) AVBD, which was especially tough due to the doxyrubicine. Scans showed recurrence less than a month after finishing chemo. Do radiation + new chemo. Metastasis to sternum. Tried 5 other chemo plans over the past 2 years, only to find more mets in hips, lungs, jaw, neck and possibly liver. Genetic mutation testing of tumor was of no value. Had to quit my career as a tax lawyer in a metro city to move back in with parents at age 28 after living independently since 18. Recently, was told no other options besides palliative radiation to keep me as comfortable as possible for the next 6-12 months--the timeframe my oncologist gave me till death. Family is devestated.

I’m on a break from chemo as of a month and a half ago because my last scans came back NED. But within the last couple weeks, I’ve been experiencing chest pain, coughing, loss of appetite, and really bad shortness of breath. My oncologist didn’t take any steps to rule out the cancer coming back, just told me to go to the ER. There, they misdiagnosed me with pneumonia. I took antibiotics for over a week and it didn’t get better. I went back the other day and they did a CT scan — found a big growth in a lung and another growth in my chest. Now my oncologist has moved up my next PET scan to evaluate these growths, but it’s not for another week. This isn’t the first time that I’ve suspected a health issue was cancer-related and been blown off by my doctors only to later find that it was cancer. I’m afraid I won’t make it to the next scan, much less whatever treatment options there might be. I can’t walk a few steps without getting out of breath. I’ve had no appetite. I can barely sleep.

Last year, my fiancee was diagnosed with stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer at the age of 28. We went through the whole treatment plan (chemotherapy, single side mastectomy, and radiation), and our scan last October showed no signs of the disease and were told she was cured. Of course we were absolutely ecstatic, but our time of peace only lasted a mere 4 months. She had a seizure in late January of this year, and this led us to finding out that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, kidney, adrenal gland, and both lungs. We were terrified, but hey, at least it's treatable and we could have some time together still (the doctor estimated about 5 years). So we started chemotherapy (ixabepilone) and were hoping that everything was going well. But in late February she started complaining of severe discomfort in her back (consistently rating her pain level at a 7 or 8) so we made a visit to the emergency room, which ended up with us being admitted for 5 days: the chemotherapy wasn't working. In that time we learned that her cancer had spread to her other kidney and adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas. She also had another seizure which led us to finding six small tumors in her brain. Currently she's going through whole brain radiation treatment and we plan to start another type of chemo soon. She's my best friend and soul mate. We've been together for 3 and a half years and engaged for 3. Before being sent home by the palliative care team (which did get her pain under control with long acting morphine) we decided to get married in the hospital, officiated by the hospital chaplain. I'm so thankful that we still have treatment options, but I am so so so worried that this next chemo won't work. I feel like I'm losing her so fast. How the fuck am I supposed to say goodbye to my best friend? She is a glass half full type, and has hope that this treatment will work and that an immunotherapy we're scheduled for (PD-1 inhibitor) will yield good results. I suspect that she's also putting on a brave face for me. I feel like I'm walking a fine line between sharing and reinforcing her confidence and steeling myself for the inevitable. I am so not ready to say goodbye to the love of my life, and I know I never will be. She is so goddamn young, all the plans we had for our lives have been crushed within a few months.

            "Value of a 2nd opinion for advanced metastasis to multiple locations. Hi all and thank-you for reading and participating in this wonderful sub. I've been mostly lurking here off and on over the last year and have had many questions over that time but try to avoid asking every single question. Except for recently. I'm going to put this one out there and get the collective wisdom of you all. **TL;DR** After my recent CT scan, my doctors have said they'll be doing palliative care because my cancer is incurable. With an expected life expectancy of 3 mos. to 2 years. Commonly around a year. My medical oncologist is looking at trials. Trying to decide about a second opinion at an out-of-state facility where telehealth is not available. &amp;#x200B; **Medical Background:** Diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma in April of 2020. I had a tumor on my right throat/base of tongue/tonsil/lymph node and a smaller growth on my left side. Had 30 radiation sessions. One and a half chemo-cisplatin doses. It was intended that I'd have 3 chemo doses but my kidneys didn't take the first dose well. The doctors delayed my 2nd dose to let me recover and also reduced the strength. By that time it was too late for the third dose since the radiation was complete. The chemo/radiation was deemed successful. First CT scan(October 2020) they saw a \"shadow\" of something on my lungs but not enough to take action. Second CT scan(January 2021) the shadow was a confirmed mass so I had a VATS wedge resection to remove it. The pathology confirmed it was the same cancer as before. Third CT scan(May 2021) metastasis to my vertebrae(currently undergoing radiation) and several metastasis to my liver(waiting for medical oncologist for a treatment plan) and this is where a second opinion \\_might\\_ be able to offer something. **Questions:** Q1. I'm already getting what I believe is good care at the University of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance(UW/SCCA). How do I(58M) evaluate the value of getting a second opinion at MD Anderson(MDA) in Texas? Q2. Can I assume my doctors and the tumor board at UW/SCCA have access to the same information as MDA? &amp;#x200B; The conflicts for me are several. 1. Since I'm in the palliative phase, I think the logistics of frequent flights to Texas and trying to get support for my symptoms while remote will be less effective and more energy consuming when maybe that effort should be conserved and used for prolonging life and enjoying the time I have left. Plus the toll on my family. 2. Wouldn't the prognosis be the same(incurable) in both places? As per my current prognosis we're looking at extending my life expectancy. Wouldn't both places have access to much of the same information and expertise? As far as I can tell metastasis to the liver is a bad thing. 3. The primary value I can see is that MD Anderson might have access to a different set of clinical trials. But I don't know how valuable that is in the overall scheme of things. &amp;#x200B; Thank-you.\n",

            "Doctors told my mum they can't help her any further. (Stage 4 Colon cancer with mets to liver and lung) Hey guys, First of all I am genuinely proud of everyone in this subreddit for sharing their stories and trying to help one other! Thanks for that.The reason I am here, is because of my mother ( born in may 1951) She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2014. She got radiotherapy, followed by (oral: tablets) chemotherapy. After reducing the tumor to a smaller size, she got an operation. During this process, the doctors saw an abnormality in her liver. She then got a second operation in which they also removed the (metastasized) tumor in her liver. So that was that, and they declared her to be \"cured\" from cancer. Fast forward to 2017. She got a heavy cough for almost a month, when we went to the doctors for her semi-annual controls, they diagnosed her with stage 4 colon cancer with metastasis in her left lung, and some small dots in her liver. The colon was clear of cancer. The doctors said curing was not possible anymore, so they started the traject of palliative therapy. * She first got 5-FU, it didn't help. * Then she got irinotecan from 26/2/19 till end of may 2019. She reacted VERY heavily, lots of diarrhea. The CT-scans showed no significant difference. So the doctors said they wanted to try something different * They tried Panitumumab. It's an EGFR- inhibitor and not regular chemo. She got intense rash on her face, but the first CT-scan (after 4 treatments) showed enormous differences. The tumor in her liver and lung shrunk significantly and we were all happy something finally seemed to work. Up until they made a second CT-scan (again after 4 treatments with panitumumab). The tumor markers were higher in her blood and the tumor in her liver showed some growth (the lung is stable). Here comes the reason why I'm here. According to this second CT-scan the doctors told us that there is nothing left that they can do. They basically cancelled ALL future appointments and told us they won't make any new scans or do anything, unless my mom gets new complaints, like heavy pain. They will then ONLY help reducing the pain, but nothing more than that. I think this is insane. My mom is 68, she has a stable weight, is not underweight , nor super overweight (161 cm long and weighs around 72 kg), she can walk, she can talk, she can basically still do a lot of things. Yes she is tired faster than before and has bellyaches everyday. But from the outside you would not say that my mom is a stage 4 cancer patient. I don't get how the doctors are giving up on her, while she is still so fit? I mean i understand she is not curable, but why don't they try something else? She has rheumatoid arthritis, they can't treat her with immunotherapy. But I've searched the web and research articles and I've found out about combination therapy where they give an EGFR- inhibitor combined with chemo (like cetuximab + irinotecan; it happens to help with patients who are not responding to irinotecan alone). Or they could give her a VEFG-inhibitor like Bevacuzimab (in combination with chemotherapy).There is also a new study about metastasized colon cancer (BEACON STUDY (in Dutch) ([https://www.avl.nl/nieuwsberichten/2019/nieuwe-combitherapie-biedt-darmkankerpati%C3%ABnt-extra-behandelkeuze/](https://www.avl.nl/nieuwsberichten/2019/nieuwe-combitherapie-biedt-darmkankerpati%C3%ABnt-extra-behandelkeuze/)) done recently which resulted in a combination therapy of a BRAF-inhibitor and EGFR-inhibitor or a BRAF-inhibitor, MEK-inhibitor and a EGFR-inhibitor. I'm wondering why don't they try something like that? So now I have a phone-appointment with her doctor tomorrow. I really want to convince her in not giving up on treatment for my mom. All I could find is written above, so now I'm asking you guys. Do you know anything else (like therapy or something else), which I can discuss with and suggest to the doctor? Are there any people who recognize themselves in this trajectory and found something else that helped them? I feel so desperate and anxious at the same time. I really don't want to accept that this is the end of everything. Thanks for reading this, and I wish you all the best! &amp;#x200B; * maybe it's good to tell that we live in the Netherlands and the BEACON study is done at the same hospital as my mom is/was receiving her treatments (that's why I also don't understand why they did not suggest giving her that treatment as a fourth option).\n",
            "Mom's cancer regressing without treatment Hello everyone. I am needing some guidance on my mother's journey with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. I will start from the beginning and try to keep it as simple as I can. She was diagnosed in early March 2017. It was not in her lungs but in her thoracic lymphnodes, liver, spine and pelvis. She started chemo right away. They started etopocide (sp) and carbo. She only made it thru 3 1/2 treatments. It made her to sick to continue. She had a great response to it. That lasted about 4 months before it started growing. They put her on irinotecan. She only did 2 infusions. It made her very sick.. Diarrhea x100. She was hospitalized at this point. Took the wait and see approach. January 2018 rolls around and again some growth. Decided on immunutherapy this time. That didn't work. Fast forward to March, tried Taxol. She did 4 full treatments of it. That ended in June. She asked to take a break. Ended up being hospitalized for about 5 weeks do to not being able to keep anything down and random fevers. High fevers too. They did all kinds of tests and they couldn't find out why. They finally concluded that it was just the cancer. Palliative care was called in. They put her on steroids and magically she could eat. Well here we are in October 2018 and the drs gave her 3 months being optimistic. That was in August. She just had scans and they showed tumors shrinking. She hasnt had chemo since June 30th. Has anyone experienced this? This has been such a roller coaster. I am her daughter and 1 of her caregivers. Just looking for others experience. I obviously know this is terminal, but just seems like she is not the norm. Thanks everyone in advance\n",
            "My mother has rare cancer and is now terminal, but i've found so many other treatments that haven't been looking into. Help? My mother has a very rare form of small cell cancer by the evil name of Neuroendocrine Carcinoma, primary site was her Colon and it has spread to her Pancreas, and Lungs, but mostly her Liver. it was originally diagnosed 7 months ago and was treated immediately with a high dose of two different types of chemo at the same time, which proved futile after 3 months. They moved her onto another type of chemo cocktail and localized radiation therapy until 1 month ago, but it did not respond what so ever, if anything it spread faster than the first chemo treatment she was on. After her last consultation they have found about 30 spots on her liver up from 5-10 6 weeks ago, it's so enlarged it is contacting her diaphragm causing shortness of breath and excessive pain. They've prescribed her 15mg of morphine every 4 fours and Ativan as needed to reduce anxiety. They deemed the treatments as unresponsive and recommended it's time to move onto Palliative care. They expect she doesn't have much time left. Rewind a little bit: my parents flew to Toronto for a second opinion after initial diagnosis and they stated the treatments given by the Cancer Institute in Edmonton, were exactly what they would have suggested. They agreed with the first chemo treatment - but it doesn't necessarily mean they would agreed with the second type of chemo/radiation therapy. I know my mom will pass away but I don't want to happen this year, I want to fight this fucker and try lengthen my Mom's life. I found this very promising article tonight and want to direct it to my mothers Doctor ASAP and ask why none of this was looked into (in as polite a way as possible) and see if it is a possibility. I'm sure they must know of such procedures and overlooked them due to interactions? Maybe it's to distant to allow surgery? either way shouldn't they have at least given us options instead of simply chemotherapy!? I admit i'm desperate, probably naive as well, but i'm trying to do anything in my power to figure this out. Please give me any insight/recommendations on how I can go about this. If anyone else on here had the same type of cancer or known anyone that has can you please let me know the outline of the treatments given?

            "Stage IV appendiceal cancer, stopping treatment - what to expect? My mom (65) has stage IV appendiceal cancer with metastasis to her liver. She had a colon resection in August with HIPEC and she's been on FOLFOX since January. Unfortunately it's just kicked her butt so hard - much harder than most, her doctor said. The first few treatments she bounced back after chemo and felt okay. Then 6 weeks ago after treatment, that bounce back never happened. She missed a treatment due to low platelets and has been having bad arthritis pain in her hip. Long story short, she (and me, her daughter and caretaker) are afraid more chemo will do more harm than good and we are considering hospice care instead, to focus on palliative care. She's 84 lbs and very weak, but when her hip and gut/bowels aren't hurting her she's often in good spirits. We went to chemo yesterday and of course, her NP and oncologist were not in to discuss our fears. So we talked to another NP who encouraged her to hold off on chemo this week and talk to the oncologist next week and reschedule chemo if she decides to proceed. We started a list of questions, and the big one that keeps coming up is \"What will it feel like if I just let the cancer take over? What can I expect\" I told her I doubted we could get a good answer about what to expect because it's different for every body. But, I figured if I could get answers anywhere, it would be reddit. Thanks in advance for any wisdom you can provide.\n",
            "Stomach Cancer went from Stage II to Stage IV I just need to vent as I've used this sub a lot over the past year since my mom (58) was diagnosed with stage II stomach cancer (signet ring cell adenocarcinoma). They were optimistic given the abdominal cavity showed no trace of cells. She did 3 rounds of FLOT chemo, 25 days of radiation as part of a clinical trial, then surgery, and 4 more rounds of FLOT. Apparently the chemo and radiation had little impact on the tumor. She got a blood clot after the surgery, not a good sign. Since then, she hasn't improved. A month ago she had fluid build up in the lungs. We recently found out there are cancer cells in the fluid. Just like that she got bumped up from stage II to stage IV. It's so surreal. I can't wrap my head around the fact that any chemo or treatments from here on out are just palliative. It makes me think if she had not done the radiation as part of the clinical trial, she might have had her stomach removed sooner, and those rogue cells might not have travelled to her chest cavity. Of course, this is unproductive thinking. I dread the months to come. Talking about death. Making final plans. Trying to wrap up a life I once knew. Fuck cancer.\n",
            "How can the world keep spinning? Three months ago my life turned upside down. My Mom, my best friend, my soulmate was diagnosed with stage iv anal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) completely unexpectedly. She had been losing weight for two years, but we chalked it up to her increased exercise. Seven months ago she began experiencing incontractible UTI’s. Five months ago she began experiencing rectal bleeding with bowel movements, and the doctors chalked it up to hemorrhoids. 22 months ago she had a clean colonoscopy. Now, she has an 8cm primary tumor extending distally from her anal verge, iliac lymph node involvement, and liver mets. No history of abnormal paps. One sexual partner for the last 35 years. Former smoker. The devastation we are experiencing cannot be articulated with human language. I know that you all know this feeling. She has been undergoing radiation 5x a week, and chemo once a week. She is also in palliative care. We haven’t really discussed a prognosis, but her tumors are shrinking. I know the statistics, and I waver between relentless hope and realistic fear that I will lose her to this horrendous disease. Treatment has been utterly brutal. All cancer is horrific, but there is a certain loss of dignity with disease that affects this area of your body, and that has compounded her incredible physical and emotional pain. Sometimes I am just numb. But, driving home from work at the hospital every day I often find myself screaming into the abyss at the top of my lungs, asking God why and how this could be happening to MY mother, MY rock, the greatest person I will ever know. I wonder how the world can continue spinning when mine has utterly come to a halt. My soul feels like it has been ripped from my physical body and shredded. I take care of cancer patients every day, and the reality of this disease is something I know all too well. I maintain my composure with my patients, and my heart always breaks for them... but now I can empathize with them in a way that I never thought I would be able to. The world is spinning around me, others’ devastating stories intertwining transiently with my own; yet I cannot wrap my mind around my pain, and cannot accept this reality. How in the ever-loving hell am I supposed to survive this? I would give anything; my life, to take this from her. Yet I cannot. We are left to watch her suffer, while utterly helpless. Clinging to hope one moment, and anticipatorily grieving the next. And she is but one story in a sea of millions, yet forever will be the center of my universe. I want to scream from the mountain tops, begging the world for prayer. For a moment of silence for my Mom. I know you all feel this, and my heart bleeds for you too. I want her to live. I am only 25, and I need her. My disabled brother needs her. This world needs her light and her love. But our bodies are faulty vessels, and I know well that our spirit transcends them, before and after our experience on this Earth. But we are helplessly enslaved to our human emotions, and My God, this pain is too much. Thank you for reading this post. I hope this is the appropriate place. Please know that I am happy to speak with any of you, and I ask humbly that you send a prayer or intentions for my Mom to the Universe. I will do the same for you. I am grateful for this community. One day at a time. M\n",
            "My mother's liver has failed I live in Southeast Asia, so I'm not sure how different the treatments are in other countries. My mother (58 y.o.) was diagnosed with Stage IIIB colorectal cancer last 2019. She had surgery to get part of her colon removed and did 3 cycles of chemo after that. In one of her physical exams around May 2020, they found that it had metastasized to her liver and lungs. Her lungs are fine, but the ones on her liver wouldn't stop growing. She's been on chemo since then, but October 2021 she kept getting a fever every afternoon, so her chemo was stopped until she was able to manage it. She was on chemo again Nov 2021, but she started to turn yellow around the 2nd week of December. Molecular pathology indicated that her chemo drugs no longer worked. We had her admitted to the hospital last week because of her jaundice and distended abdomen. Her gastroenterologist told me that her liver has failed and what we're gonna do now is basically palliative care. She's extremely uncomfortable and keeps groaning in discomfort. I ask her if she's in pain and she always tell me she isn't. I'm a mess. So is my father.\n",
            "Need some help Hey guys. Some backstory: my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with met to her liver. She’s met with an oncologist and the prognosis seemed pretty grim as the cancer has spread a bit in her liver. My mom is now convinced that chemotherapy 1. Can cause more cancer, 2. Will lower the immune system 3. Will basically kill her. So she’s against doing it rn. She has a friend that supposedly has amazing results from THC and diet and they have supposedly cured several people of their cancer. I think these things can have beneficial effects but isn’t it incredibly stupid to just not do chemo? The dr said it is most likely not curable so it is palliative care. But shouldn’t we at least try the chemo to see how her body responds? Can you guys help me convince my mom. It’s driving me crazy that she is just throwing a chance away\n",

            "My dad has terminal lung cancer Hi there. My father, 77, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer a month ago. The docs couldn't say how much time might have passed since he \"got it\". Or how much time he has left. It has metastized to bones, brain, liver and kidney. He was in hospital until last week but is now at home lying in bed. He has no energy at all, so the planned chemotherapy didn't even start. Now nothing can be done other than palliative care. It's been 3 days he didnt drink or eat anything (he didnt eat much before that either). He hasn't been on the toilet for a week now. He's lying in bed all day. He doesn't have the power to even talk. And everytime I ask him if he wants something to eat, he gets really angry and tells me that all he wants is to die. He is and always was a really stubborn person. It's hard. For him as well as my mom and me (28). Just until 2 months ago he seemed perfectly healthy and sane. I don't know what else to say. Cancer sucks.\n",
            "Just thought I'd share about my dad... First of all thank you so much to everyone who took the time to read my post from a couple weeks ago where I shared of my dad's illness. The outpouring of support was so unexpected and so overwhelming that I couldn't even begin to get back to all of you who reached out or offered sympathies. Sorry that I couldn't take time to acknowledge every one of you but just know I read every response and each one touched me very deeply and was genuinely appreciated. However, I'm sad to share that my dad succumbed to his cancer very rapidly and passed on earlier this evening. He died at home in his own bed with my mom, my sister and her husband, and myself surrounding him. Considering how much pain and discomfort he's been in this last week, his passing seemed very peaceful. Two palliative nurses came to see him and while checking his vitals discovered that he had no pulse on his right side and was showing signs of organ failure. Realizing it was his time, they left us alone for our family to surround him and share in his final moments. He used his last breaths to ask if we would all he okay, and my mom told him we would always be looking after each other. After that, he nodded and slipped away quietly. I'm heartbroken and still feel angry of the robbed time, he was only 54, is just short of celebrating 30 years of marriage to my mom, and now he'll never get to be a grandpa or see me get married. It's not fair at all that this happened to him, to my family, but from the moment of his diagnosis this was really the best thing any of us could have hoped for. He knew there was no treatment, no chance at a normal pain-free life again. I'm happy he didn't have to linger in senseless suffering and I'm especially happy that he got to leave this world somewhat on his own terms...he hated the idea of withering away in a hospital, he even asked my mom a week ago if she would be okay with him dying in their bed...and he had so much love surrounding him in his final moments. Now I just feel so relieved I made it home in time to spend a couple days with him, I had no idea how close I was to possibly missing him. Apparently he said a few times before I arrived he was ready to die but everyone could tell he was just holding out for me to come home and I'm so glad I could be there for him. All in all, I feel surprisingly peaceful and alright as of now but maybe it hasn't hit me that he's gone yet cause it's so new, maybe it will hit me later when something happens that I would normally text him about but then I realize he's not there. I know I'm going to miss him a lot, and I'll selfishly be wanting him around for all the milestones of my life that you would always just assume a father should be there for. It's heartbreaking and overwhelming, especially because a month ago we didn't even know about his tumours and from his diagnosis and onwards things just spiralled so fast. It's heartbreaking, but I'm happy he's no longer in pain and I'm also touched to see all the friends who's lives he impacted and the support that's come my way today and that my family and I have found in each other has been remarkable.\n",
            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 7 >> Thanks to everyone who contributes to this subreddit This is one place where I can be sure to get a response. My poor dad is \"at the pointy end\" of a particularly aggressive cancer, as the palliative doctor said today. Prognosis has gone from 6 months to a year to now days or weeks. You all have provided me with kind words and advice. I have not given up on him, but medicine has. Dying with dignity, time to decide whether to bring him home, go to a hospice or leave him where he is. He still has his mental faculties, but the medication is rapidly slowing him down. He dictated some letters to me today, glad we did it while he still can. Thanks to all the health professionals that care. It makes things better to know he is in compassionate hands.\n",
            "My dad passed away tonight. My outstanding 61 year old father had stage 4 colon cancer for two and a half years. It spread to his peritoneal lining which doctors kept telling us is harder to treat than if it were on a vital organ. We all kept positive throughout that time. My dad especially. He’s a tough as nails USMC vet who never complained, never gave up and always gave us so much love. Endless love. It doesn’t feel real. Me and my mom were lucky enough to be there with him and hold his hands, telling him how much we love him and that we’ll be okay without him. I kept crying on and off. He originally went to the ER yesterday for a bowel obstruction, uncontrollably committing the entire night and day. Then the palliative care doctor called me around 3 PM. It happened so fast. He had an oxygen mask on and wasn’t receiving fluids since it was filling up his lungs and his heart wasn’t responding well to it. I knew he hated the mask. I asked him to confirm if he wanted hospice care, he nodded his head. He knew it was the end. I did too. My mom was more in shock, in denial of it. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask and put an oxygen tube through his nose (cannula I think,) his breathing immediately shortened and shallowed. He couldn’t breathe on his own. They gave him morphine, so he wasn’t in any pain. The sweet nurse offered him a Coke, but he was too weak. The palliative care doctor was very kind to my family and my dad as well, which I’m so appreciative of. My mom held his hand the entire time while praying with him. Then my dad suddenly stopped breathing. I know people always say “it happened so fast,” but it’s taken me enduring this to realize it’s true. Time wasn’t real in the hospital. They were supposed to move him to an upper floor, but we stayed with him in the dark ER room. When I realized how quickly he stopped breathing, I panicked and ran outside to the nurse station just shouting that my dad stopped breathing. Three of them came inside and immediacy began doing CPR, and my mom started bawling. I’ve never ever seen my mom cry like that before. My sadness turned into shock, and I wrapped my arms around my mom to comfort her while she sobbed. She was staring the whole time as they were trying to revive him. I told her to look away if it was too hard. I was crying a little bit, but knew I needed to comfort her. I’m still shocked. I went through his cellphone and found old videos and pictures of me and him. They made me breakdown. It dawned on me that I’ll never get a text from him again. Never go to the grocery store with him again. Never get advice from him again. Never hear his dark, yet endearing marine humor again. It feels like I’m not living my own life. I’m going through the motions. I’m scared of the future. I’m 20 years old, barely about to begin college this fall. My brother is only 15. My boyfriend is also in the Marine Corp, and only got to meet my dad once last year. It’s all so confusing and I feel lost and broken. I know with time me and my family will be okay again. But a part of me has died with my dad. The only thing that gives me peace is knowing he wasn’t in pain when he went, and that he’s no longer suffering but whole again in the kingdom of heaven. If anyone out there is going through something similar, or if you’re blessed enough to have your loved one still alive and breathing, please be with them. Take pictures of them and with them. Take videos. Record their voice. Tell them you love them. Life can be cruel and short for some. I never thought I wouldn’t have my dad around at 20 years old. I’m his girl. He taught me so much and loved me so much and I’ll strive everyday to be the kind of person he’d be proud of. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. My brain is hazy right now. Sending my love out there to everyone being affected by this ugly, unfair disease. May we all find peace in our hearts.\n",
            "How do I tell my dad that the doctors are giving up hope? My dad has stage 4 thymus/lung cancer. It's spread to both lungs, and my dad is having difficulties breathing. He can still walk, and still has somewhat of an appetite. English isn't his first language, and I normally go to doctor visits with him. He was diagnosed last year in April, and since then he's had countless chemo, and radiation treatments. He had brain surgery last year in December, and the doctors were surprised with how fast he recovered. Things were looking up for a bit. He had hopw. Then he was put on immunotherapy, which didn't work. From July of this year, he's gotten progressively worse. Yesterday was the first time visiting palliative care dr. The thing is, he doesn't understand that its the end of the road treatment. I think that both him and my mum know that the cancer is incurable, but they still hold onto the hope. They think that palliative care is just another treatment to help decrease the size of cancer. When they asked me, I said it was just a doctor who prescribed medicine. I can't bring myself to tell them. My dad's still undergoing chemo as a last ditch effort to decrease the rate the tumours are growing. How do I tell him that the doctors are nearly giving up? I tried to suggest him get his affairs in order. Write a will maybe. He just said that he wants to wait until he gets better. I'm not sure if he'll get better than this. He wants to fight, and I want to see him fight.. but it's a loosing battle. I don't know what he would do if I told him this .\n",

I’m 24 years old and my mother passed away almost three months ago from a reoccurrence of lymphoma after a long battle with chemo and was a CAR-T patient. My father is seemingly in a much more grave situation and I don’t want to watch him suffer for a long time. I just want him to begin palliative care and not prolong his life unnecessarily. He wants to go through immune therapy to fight to live longer but he probably doesn’t have more than 6 months. I have to respect his wishes, however I still struggle to accept his decision. Grieving my mom and at the same time losing my father, and going through this situation all over again is really quite a lot, and most days, I’m not sure how I’m going to get through this. Update: my father has transitioned to hospice care. He’s behaving very similarly to how my mom was behaving in her final days. It’s beginning to be very difficult for me to be here on my own watching him pass away. I’ve been much closer to my dad than my mom in the recent years and this has become particularly painful for me to witness. We used to have riveting conversations that would go late into the night. We’ve always been able to talk like this. However, now, he’s not very responsive, it really breaks my heart to know I won’t ever have a good long conversation with him ever again.\n",

A week ago we got the devistating news that now our only options are chemo or palliative care. We have opted for chemo and told there is a 10 to 25% of it working, which as you can tell is not great. Mever thought i would be losing a parent before 30 bit here we are, i have a sister as well so know i need to stay atrong for them, but honestly i am not handling this news well, the only way i can carry on my regular day is if i don't think about it but his time could be coming soon so i dont have excuses for myself anymore Im writing this post because its only now i have ever seen him cry, he is absolutely devastated and it breaks my heart. even back when things were fine he was always a quite, stoic man. Nowadays he is even more quiet but i can tell he iw down. I need advice on how to cheer him up and bring him out of it. We also have the issue of him telling his own family (my grandma and aunties) they live abroad and my dad cant tell them the news. Everytime i bring it up he goes quiet and i know its because he can't bring himaelf to tell them the news, and honestly i dont blame him. But i feel they must know at this point.

            "Dad passed away in Hospice Friday night 8/23 Hell, everyone, I'm writing this post mostly to vent and get some advice on how to come to terms with this. I am 21 years old and just started my senior year at North Carolina State University. My dad (58) was diagnosed with esophageal cancer almost 2 years ago in December of 2017. Our family had a great plan to do radiation and chemo at Duke in January of 2018 and then have an esophagectomy to remove the main tumor and basically cure him. One of the worst days of my life was that day of surgery, May 9th, 2018. The Dr's found mets that had spread to the peritoneum area and it was confirmed that it was stage 4. The worst thing was that they didn't show up on any scans so it was very shocking to have a false sense of hope about curing the cancer from the beginning. They stopped the surgery and woke him up. Telling my dad that the surgery couldn't be completed because they found it spread was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. He was still loopy from the medicine and it was terrible breaking the news to him like this. After that, we resumed more chemo and immunotherapy treatment (Keytruda I think). And we got referred to MD Anderson in Houston, TX. He got put on a clinical trial there and he had a couple of HIPEC procedures there. The rest of 2018 were good results, nothing growing on scans or anything so it was great. Then a surgeon agreed to do a full gastrectomy in January of 2019. The mets were still in his peritoneum but MD Anderson thought this would be the best route to extend his life and give him the best option. The surgery was a success but we knew it would change the way he could eat the rest of his life. A couple of months went by and we started treatment back up again. He started having these cramps and couldn't eat the portions that he used to. Then in July, we went to Houston for another scan and it seemed fine. About 2 weeks after that, he had some constipation so we got another scan. This was where reality came in. We found that he had a bowel obstruction of his small intestine and it was inoperable due to the stage of the cancer. It was very grim. We then knew it was terminal. I had to finish up an internship in Atlanta which was really hard because I knew my dad wanted me to finish it strong and not quit but I had anxiety about him dying and me wanting to spend time with him. We had palliative care come and give him fluids 3 times a week because he eventually could barely eat anything as he just threw it up and caused immense pain. The good thing is that I cut my internship a week early and went home and had great family time. Conversations that I will remember for the rest of my life. My dad was so influential and touched so many lives it's so hard to come to terms with this. His dad passed away from cancer when he was 9 so I feel like I learned so many lessons from him and how he overcame that. It's over now and we did everything we possibly could to prolong his life and fight that disease. my mom has recorded some of his motivational \"lectures\" the past year or so. We just listened to one and he said that he'd almost rather die on the operating table than to have us see him suffer in hospice. It breaks my heart hearing that now because he worked so hard to create only good memories for his children. #FuckCancer\n"

            "I also am not at the point you are at yet... but for me I have chosen to do chemo while it is still looking to buy me some quality time down the road. My cancer is considered terminal but I have not been given a time frame yet, seeing how I respond to this front line chemo regimen. What I won't be doing is staying on chemo if it is not going to significantly alter my outcome. I've imagined myself in your shoes, and I would certainly be stopping chemo and squeezing every bit of life out of the time I had left. I do hope you tell those closest to you, I would be devastated if my loved one withheld that from me . Talk to your dr about palliative and hospice care... get as much as you possibly can out of those remaining months. I hope you find joy in the journey and at the very end, I wish you a peaceful death. It is what I wish for myself.\n",
            "Prior to the chemo, I think my doctors expected 18 to 24 months of palliative care until I died from it. You can't blame the doctors because each case is a sampling of 1. It is impossible to predict your clinical outcome from the time you present. I received my diagnosis two years and one month ago so I am a statistical outlier. I am healthy. I can eat what I want. My weight is good. My appetite is TOO good. I walk about six miles a day. I even started a new job a year ago. I tolerate chemo really well and got a great result. Other than the ostomy you wouldn't think I had cancer. Because of that I think my oncology team sees an opportunity to do the LAR surgery and give me a fighting chance at another 48-60 months. Do you remember the movie \"The Princess Bride\"? Each day the dread pirate would threaten to kill the protagonist Wesley. I feel like my cancer journey has been the same. Good Job denismeniz... the chemo seems to be working ... cancer will most likely kill you in 18-24 months. That is how I have lived for two years but now instead of feeling resigned to my fate I have some hope. Sorry for the wall of text just to say \"Your doctors don't really know your expiration date until it is OBVIOUS.\" Good luck on your journey. Stay upbeat because the alternative sucks. Cry when you need to and take naps when you want to.\n",
            "So true. Warning, possibly annoying optimistic rave ahead. I have Stage 4 colon cancer, no cures out there and I'm on life-extending chemo. So far my cancer is kept nicely at bay, eventually it will start to grow until it kills me, if I don't die of something else first, like the blood clot I got from chemo a few months ago. I'm happier than I've ever been in my life. I have been gazing at my death for over half a year now, and it's changed everything. I have the choice to choose my attitude and how I face each day. I spent two months freaking out and then things started to shift the other way. I have fantastic support from my family, friends, and medical team. My meditation practice helped reduce my freak-outs initially, now I have a focused study of what's important in life and how to face death. I've talked to my palliative care director and I know generally how I'm going to die. I have friends who work in hospice that will be with me. I get knocked down from chemo every other week, but it's helping me to live much longer than I would without it. I'm much more emotionally open, from occasionally bursting into tears to having more and more amazing connections with people who understand what's truly important in life, and living in wonder about how beautiful everything is around me. The possibility of cancer and other maladies is one of the conditions of living in a human body. There is no escape from death, it comes from us all. Instead of dealing with it when I was 70-80-90 like I expected, I'm dealing with it now. Most unnecessary things (and people) have dropped away. I still freak out from time to time, but my default state is to be happy and grateful most of the time. What matters is what's happening right now.\n",
            "I'm 62 with mets to bones, lung lining, lymph nodes and a lot under my skin. My understanding is that my oncologist will probably never give up...there is always more chemo that might eke out a few more months. At some point my organs will start failing and that will be it. I'm going to be the one to give up when the 'treatment' side effects outweigh the few extra months gained. I'm not there yet. What I won't tolerate is pain. And you shouldn't have to either. My GP knows my cancer is ultimately terminal and she works with me to find the right pain meds and plenty of them. I've also just had another dose of radiation for pain. This is all palliative rather than curative. I'm still living a fairly normal life, after 18 months, still independent etc but rest a lot. I will eventually end up in hospital/ hospice where I hope to float into the next life on a peaceful sea of morphine. I don't know when that will be..12 months? Two years? Yes it is depressing. Possibly a lot more so for you, being so young. I'm so sorry you are going through this. My way of dealing with it is to be hugely self centred and try to make every day the sort of day I want it to be. My focus is very narrow, on what really matters. I hope and pray you can get some pain relief and enjoy what time you have left.\n",
            "I'm sorry for what you have to go through. Have you talked to a doctor about palliative care? Palliative care is taking care of the patient to make them feel as comfortable as possible during their treatment. I was relying on my narcotics a lot with the pain from my tumors during my chemo and after surgeries. I don't want to imagine what my life would be like without pain meds. And maybe find other survivors and have group chats with them. I am often motivated when I hear the stories of survivors and what they went through. I know the feeling of being sick, in pain, and a burden on family members. It's not fun, but cancer is a roller coaster. Gonna have ups and downs.\n",
            "I had recurrence (brain mets) in October. I just had this very conversation with my oncologist. I asked them to ballpark how much time I have left and they said\" you likely won't be here next year\". They don't have a crystal ball obviously but as hard as it was to hear, it gave me a ton of clarity about what comes next. So I am still receiving treatments but I have a decision to make about when to stop that and go on palliative care. I figure if I am terminal why put myself through the hell of chemo? I just applied for Social Security Disability. I am separating from my job next month. No more work and that makes me REALLY happy. This week I am headed off to see old friends in the desert. I am going to live my best life; for however long that may be. But yeah....it truly sucks. I'm 47, otherwise healthy and not ready to exit this existence. If you haven't read \"The Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle you should. It really has helped me to put things into perspective. To work at stying present. To accept my mortality. I wish you all the best. It is a difficult road. Fuck cancer\n",
            "You are being let down in the worst way. I saw my GP on February the first, my preliminary blood results worried her so she phoned me and asked me to admit myself to hospital that evening. I felt like a hypochondriac because my only symptom was breathlessness. On the second I had my CT scan. Stage 4. Later that same day I had my colonoscopy so they could take biopsies. During the next 4 weeks I had further blood tests, an MIR and two meetings with my consultants. The first meeting was to confirm things (basically, girl, you gon die!) and the second was to discuss treatment. I began palliative chemo on February the 28th. So far I'm reacting very well. The primary cancer is all but gone, although the metastases will still kill me eventually. I was given 1 to 2 years with chemo, 18 month average, but everything is shrinking. At most I feel bad for 4 days every two weeks, from my chemo, which means I have 10 days when I'm fine. Honestly, I have more side effects from the chemo than I ever had symptoms from the cancer. But it's keeping me alive so I try not to complain. And like I said, I have many more good days than bad. Given how everything's going, I'm hopeful I might defy the odds but even of not, I intend to make the most of the time I have left. i created a bucket list of fun things to do and my friends and family get together with me one weekend a month and we do some things from the list. I've joined local groups and I'm out there, meeting new people and trying new things. You need to make some noise and if possible, get yourself admitted to hospital. In-patients always take precedence over outpatients. If you're in pain, go to the ER, kick up a fuss, play up your symptoms. If you can't do that, I'm sure your wife can do it for you and demand you be seen and admitted. It's an old adage but it's true, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. One of you needs to get loud and start complaining. Finally, this is not the end. Once you're on proper pain relief and treatment, things will look up. And besides, you're only stage 3. You still have a chance of being cured, which is more than I have. Don't waste it.\n",
            "Sorry you're going through this. Fuck cancer. The first thing my oncologist said to me (39 M) was \"we can't cure it\" I'm on palliative care and have chemo/immuno every three weeks. It's shit, I hate everything about it but it is working for now. Would I do the chemo knowing what I know now? yes I would but I don't know if I'll say the same in another 6 months and I can understand anybody refusing treatment. I have no interest in suffering but so far life is still reasonably comfortable and enjoyable and I want to prolong that as much as I can and so far chemo helps with that. Not sure if this is any help, all I can do is share my story because it's a very personal decision that nobody has tried to influence for me. If I wanted to refuse treatment and was pressured into it I can guarantee I would come to resent that person at some point.\n",

            "Yes! Having just gone through this with my mom I have some advice: Get a palliative care consult asap. Palliative specialists advocate for and treat the whole person and family through times of critical illness. N.B. Palliative medicine is not hospice (although it's common for palliative providers to also do hospice care). Palliative medicine is for anyone of any age at any stage of critical illness. This is especially important for people just starting their cancer journey. Consult early and often. Palliative specialists may be an MD, NP, or DO and have prescription privileges (at least in the States) for narcotics. If the current pain regimen is not working, request another consult. It took a week of adjustments for the palliative specialist to find a regimen that worked for my mom. It was well worth it. ETA: As /u/mondo (MD) noted, there are a number of factors that influence pain management decisions. Part of the reason it was difficult to find a reliable regimen for my mom was balancing pain control and functionality. If the dosing was too high she was lethargic but when it was too low her pain levels were 7+/10. Her goal was never to be pain-free--just to bring the level down to 3 or 4 which for her, was manageable. Some of her doctors were overly hesitant to prescribe any pain medication which seemed odd given that she was stage 4 with painful bone metastases. Introducing a palliative specialist helped in terms of educating the doctors (as well as us) and helping navigate expectations.\n",

As easy as it is to jump to end of life, since this is day one of his admission, I think it would be helpful for you to know that even though it sounds like he is very sick and the recent cancer diagnosis makes his clinical status more unknown, there is a chance he will get better, at least for now. I will say, without knowing lab values, where his cancer has spread, and maybe risk of other infection, certainty of my last statement is unknown; however, some IV fluids, antibiotics, probably some oxygen and medications to manage other symptoms he may be having will do him good. I'm a clinical dietitian and work on oncology. I feel for you and your family - it's hard to feel so fearful and uncertain. A palliative care consult may be beneficial. Palliative care IS NOT hospice care and it is a wonderful support service to make sure patients are comfortable while they may progress to end or life/hospice care. As a dietitian, I will say that if they can feed him safely, please get some supplements or milkshakes on board (and maybe some appetite stimulants, if MD didn't already order). If he is too short of breath to eat much or eat safely, sips of high calorie beverages are the way to go. Deep breaths!

OP is asking for help because (s)he is in a tough place. /u/west_of_nod I would encourage you to talk to your father's palliative care team or oncologist and see what resources there are for family members of cancer patients, because it sounds like you could benefit very much from a support person on their end like a talk therapist. Additionally, palliative care could be on board to help guide him for his symptom management including pain. Medication won't make pain go away, but it will help. Morphine is a fine drug for cancer pain.\n",

If you can afford it he might have a better quality of life with pain relief. And you might feel better too. I wish you and your family peace x \n",

            "It sounds like despite your initial feelings when you posted, from the comments you seem to have come around to him making his decisions, and understanding how frail he really is. There is also more we don't know about his cancer, like whether surgery would even be a cure for him. I want to reassure you that he does not need to be abandoned by the medical system. Palliative care, with a focus on quality of life and comfort is a way of looking after his needs, symptoms, and dignity even without attacking the cancer. Palliative care though needs to be personalized - it's important for his care team to know who he is and what he's been through as it will surely shape how he dies. I would definitely want to hear the story you told us if it was one of my patients, so please share it with the healthcare team\n",

With an ejection fraction of 38% that definitely will complicate his surgery and ongoing ability to tolerate treatments. That number continues to decrease as we age and effects so much more than just the heart but also his breathing and energy levels!! Cancer treatments are no joke. It will be important to know if it’s stage 3 or 4 because that makes a big difference in what treatments are offered and how he is expected to respond. A year on chemo is a very long time … are you sure they didn’t say immunotherapy? Have y’all considering asking for a palliative care consult while in the hospital? They are amazing at sitting a family down and answering all the questions you have, making sure you understand what is going on now and what the next steps will bring.

            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 3 >> I can really relate to your post. My father also was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-small cell adenocarcinoma of the lung. He also had to get a second biopsy after they didn't collect enough tissue in the first attempt. And he had a pleural effusion that was drained. He started on Opdivo (immunotherapy drug) first while regaining his strength after experiencing an ileus (lack of movement in the intestines due to all the painkillers for the bone met in his spine). Once he regained strength 2 weeks later, chemo was added to his treatment plan (CarboTaxol). He also had 10 palliative sessions of radiation. Unfortunately, nothing helped stop the progression and he went on hospice to pass peacefully just 9 weeks after diagnosis. The chemo was very hard on him even though the oncologist said once weekly CarboTaxol is generally well-tolerated. He was actually relieved to stop the chemo. Now, everyone tolerates chemo differently but it just wasn't for my dad – he slept nonstop and lost 10 pounds in just 3 days. The immunotherapy drug made him pretty tired and achy, but he did tolerate the Opdivo better than the chemo. We learned a lot during my father's journey, and one thing I recommend to anyone dealing with NSCLC is to really dig into the molecular profile of the tumor. For instance, I wished we knew earlier that my dad's tumor had a very unfavorable co-mutation (KRAS and STK-11) which is considered virtually undruggable with its extremely low response to treatment. We didn't find out about the tumor co-mutation until he had the liquid biopsy (Guardant 360 test) after we learned the first biopsy was inadequate. It seems oncologists focus on favorable or targetable mutations, but are reticent to divulge details about unfavorable mutations (I get it; relentless optimism is part of the job). That was our experience, anyway. Everyone feels differently about treatment no matter the prognosis. If your dad is intent on fighting, I think the best thing is to support him 100% no matter his decision. And he may have a remarkable response to Keytruda! In my dad's case, the oncologist recommended he stop treatment to preserve quality of life and my father and all of us were on board. It was still an extremely somber and sad moment for us to hear that the cancer was behaving so aggressively and we had limited time, but hospice (and all of us) made sure he was comfortable those last few weeks. I hope that your dad's treatments are well tolerated, that the cancer is arrested in its progression, and that you get much more precious time with your father! Btw, CBD and medical marijuana greatly helped my father with his appetite. Fathers are so special and it's so hard to watch an extremely fit and youthful person decline rapidly (my dad was a quite fit and youthful 75-year-old when he passed in late-April).\n",

            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 0 >> So sorry you are faced with this. My mom is stage 4 and is on palliative chemo to prolong her life too. I think she may be in denial because she believes she will still beat the cancer. Iv'e heard stories of some people living for many years with stage4 cancer, but i think it depends on the individual, treatment and type of cancer. It must be so distressing for you, and no one deserves this evil of cancer. Sorry i don't have much advice but sending you prayers and hugs 🤍\n",
            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 0 >> I'm 62 with mets to bones, lung lining, lymph nodes and a lot under my skin. My understanding is that my oncologist will probably never give up...there is always more chemo that might eke out a few more months. At some point my organs will start failing and that will be it. I'm going to be the one to give up when the 'treatment' side effects outweigh the few extra months gained. I'm not there yet. What I won't tolerate is pain. And you shouldn't have to either. My GP knows my cancer is ultimately terminal and she works with me to find the right pain meds and plenty of them. I've also just had another dose of radiation for pain. This is all palliative rather than curative. I'm still living a fairly normal life, after 18 months, still independent etc but rest a lot. I will eventually end up in hospital/ hospice where I hope to float into the next life on a peaceful sea of morphine. I don't know when that will be..12 months? Two years? Yes it is depressing. Possibly a lot more so for you, being so young. I'm so sorry you are going through this. My way of dealing with it is to be hugely self centred and try to make every day the sort of day I want it to be. My focus is very narrow, on what really matters. I hope and pray you can get some pain relief and enjoy what time you have left.\n",

            "I want to say as an oncology nurse, end of life (especially with cancer) is an incredibly difficult journey, not just for the patient, but for the family too. Even when everything has already been prepared. People are going to deal with their stress and grief in different ways, there's no way around that. It is okay to feel how you do. Just because you are not constantly at the bedside doesn't mean you are experiencing any less grief than your brother and father. A few other people mentioned palliative care and/or hospice. Since she is already on palliative care ask to speak with one of the care team to address your concerns. They may have some suggestions or resources. I would also take the time to talk with your father and brother if you have a good relationship with them. Perhaps a conversation will bring about some ideas to make things more comfortable for everyone involved. Also, I want you to know, your life is more than \"the shit son who just plays video games and does jack shit.\" Your life began with your mother. I doubt your mother is looking at you in her final days and thinking that you are anything but the son she loves and has always loved. She may not always be with you, but you will always hold a part of her with you even when she is gone.\n",
            "Sounds like you are caring for your dad in the best ways possible. Be present. Tell dad how loved he is. Reassure him when he is confused. While difficult, it really is such a special, precious moment in time. We talk a lot about the physical process of birth, but not of death. Hospice support can be really helpful about this. Another option that I found really helpful was the bbc podcast palliative care episode. The podcast is your, me and the big c’. I Lost my mum to aggressive cancer. She was just 50 and I was 26. She just changed so quickly that we didn’t get a chance to catch our breaths. My mum didn’t want to talk about what was going to happen. She said that she couldn’t bear the thought of leaving us. So we followed her wishes. We knew how loved we were and what we meant to her so there were no need for those conversations that needed to occur. I wish I had talked to her about a minor disagreement we had before she got sick because I have played it over and over in my mind since. So, if there is anything that you need to discuss do In a gentle way at a lucid moment. With mum - as I work in health i knew what was going to happen. My family were positive ++ that she was going to overcome this. Hope keeps people going and that is just what mum and my family needed.\n",
            "My father just passed due to lung cancer. It was also terminal with no hope of remission. His lung cancer had spread to the brain. I did everything by myself. It's hard. You feel like you're not doing enough. I just tried to be positive (he lived a year longer than expected). You many want to start palliative care. She'll start to withdraw and her appetite will decrease. Just talk to her like normal. Don't push her if she doesn't want anything. I put a post on FB for messages to my Dad and we read them to him. Have visitors, look at old pictures, talk about your childhood memories. Let her talk ... my Dad had a lot of questions. He asked me what is was like to die. I just explained your body will prepare you. That he'd start to feel calm and no fear. Don't miss a minute. My husband and father in law (Stage 4) also have/had cancer at the exact same time. I lived at oncology. Unfortunately taking care of her will no longer be your job. That was hard. I was so tired and beat down but I don't regret anything. If she gets forgetful just agree. Don't correct her.\n",
            "((((hugs)))) I'm really, really sorry about your dad. My own has been gone 2 years as of June 11th, and I miss him every single day. My mom was his primary caretaker, so I might be able to give a little insight here. Like your mom, mine is fairly self-sufficient, in that she doesn't like to put the burden of info on others - she'll just keep it to herself until it's out of her ability to handle it. =/ If your dad isn't enrolled in a palliative care program, I *strongly* urge you to consider this. Talk to your parents, specifically your dad, because this is central to *quality of life*, which is THE most important thing in a terminal situation. If you can't beat it, at least be comfortable, you know? Palliative care can often seamlessly transition into hospice - it did for my dad. Medicaid/medicare are *awesome* resources for this, especially if he's already on disability. Palliative services will often go to the patient's home a couple of times a week to check on things, do stuff that involves needles (my dad required injections of a bone marrow boosting med), and generally provide support to the patient AND the family. And this is frequently a service offered for free, or at little cost, with health insurance. My dad was on full disability and my parents paid $0 for his palliative/hospice care and medications related to that care. One other thing these folks do is not really a happy topic, but it's important. When your dad does pass, you make *one* phone call to the hospice folks, and they take care of his body. They're professional, gentle, and very respectful of the hell you'll be going through. They will clean him up, get him dressed if needed, and put him into a physical state that is acceptable for loved ones to say their final goodbyes, if you're up for that. They'll also handle transport to a funeral home. No sirens or attention drawn. Our hospice folks rolled up in a minivan. VERY discreet. As for your mom? Oh, man... it's hard. I'm not going to sugar coat it, this fucking SUCKS. My parents were married 42+ years before he passed away in her arms, and she is LOST without him. This is a shitty situation for everyone, I know, but it's one of those things she'll need to approach on her own. Before he passes, make sure she has time away. I know that sounds cold, but it is SO important for caregivers to get a break. Take her out to dinner every couple of weeks. Go to a movie together. Shop for baby stuff together. Just a couple of hours is a *huge* emotional boost for people taking care of the dying. As far as living together? Well... is this going to be a situation where you're sharing the *entire* house, or is there a mother-in-law space for her, so it's a separated situation? If possible, separate is better! This is a topic near to me, because it's tradition in my family that the daughter takes the mom into her home when the mom is retiring/has lost her husband. I'm the first generation where it hasn't happened yet. However, without a bit of knowledge into how your relationship with your mom is, that's a reaaaaally tough question to answer. My mom &amp; I are extremely close, but if we had to live together, we'd kill each other for sure. I adore her, I admire her, I very much respect her... but there's a reason I moved out! ;) If it's going to be a huge burden on you guys, if you don't get along with her super well, if your *husband* isn't okay with it... maybe consider looking into senior living communities she'd be able to afford? There are a lot of them that allow medicare/Medicaid funding, and if you happen to be in the greater Seattle area, hit me up - my mom works in the elder care industry, so I can get you *tons* of local resources for this. =) Aside from all of that... if there's anything specific you want to know, feel free to ask it. It sounds like we have somewhat similar familial situations here (but no baby on our side), and I'm happy to share whatever you want to ask. ((hugs)) \n",
            "You can try looking into clinical trials to see if there’s anything out there for the type of cancer your father has. If you find that there is truly nothing left in the way of options, which does happen, I agree with the other poster that it’s time to look into hospice. Hospice is a big and scary word and many people take it to mean that time left is very limited. That isn’t necessarily true. Hospice is now just another term for palliative care and your dad may have the full 3 months before his time is officially up. If you cannot manage home hospice care, research hospice homes in your area. The one that mom went to in the end felt like a 5 star resort rather than a hospice home, there are some nice ones out there. Most of all, take time to care for yourself, too. Make sure you’re eating well and taking some downtime here and there. This isn’t easy on your dad, but it will also take its toll on you and your family. Try and minimize that impact by practicing self-care. It’s easier said than done, but it’s important. If you ever want someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I lost my mom to stage IV lung cancer right before Christmas. \n",
            "I’m sorry your dad and family have received this news. Although it never hurts to get a second opinion and hope/pray for a better outcome- there are always stories of survivors that outlive their doctor’s prognosis. When my mom was given 3 months, we looked up any clinical trials she may qualify for and asked her doctor to sign her up. My mom divided her jewellery amongst the grandkids and made videos for all my siblings sharing her words of advice, prayers and telling us she loved us. We felt the weight of time and how precious it was so that whatever moments we shared together we were present and absorbing those moments and recognizing every smile, tear, touch and hug as a gift. We also arranged for her hospice/palliative care at home so that she had a hospital bed at home and nurses/doctors visits at home. She passed before her clinical trial began but she was able to say goodbye to all our aunts, uncles, cousins and we were all with her during her final breaths... It was hard and it’s still hard but I’m so grateful we got to say goodbye properly and cry our hearts out together and laugh about all good memories we shared. My heart goes out to you and your dad- I hope sharing my story helps you in some way.\n",
            "It’s tough. My dad’s decline has been so fast compared to the duration of his illness. A month and a half ago he barely had anything showing up on his PET scan, then two weeks later he was riddled with little tumors. Talk to your mom about palliative care. It’s not the same as hospice, so that helped my dad with making the decision to enter into it because, to him, hospice meant giving up entirely. Palliative is there to treat the symptoms while they go through treatment and can help figure out a way to keep your mom comfortable. Watching is definitely the most difficult part for the loved ones. It’s frightening and sickening to watch your loved one waste away in front of your eyes. Seek help for yourself, whether that be therapy or just spending time with friends and venting. I have been part-time caretaker for my dad and in the beginning I felt the same way you do—that I wanted to be with him 24/7. It gave me anxiety to leave him. Once I would get back to work, though, it was a comfort to have a sense of normalcy and be able to dig in and let work take some of the constant worry off of my mind. To worry about something other than just my dad. I’m on leave from work now and my dad is in hospice. Everyone told me that I would know the right time to take leave and be with him and it’s pretty much true. I opted to start my leave before he basically became comatose so that I could spend time with him while he’s still lucid and I know I won’t regret it. The doctors and nurses have seen this enough to be able to give you a bit of a timeline that can help you decide when is the right time to take leave and be with your mom. Sorry the reply was so long, but I hope it helps. Reading through this reddit has been a big help to me through this whole experience and, though it’s saddening to know others have been through similar, it’s comforting to know me and my family are not alone in our experience. All my best to you and loving thoughts sent that your mom gets the help she needs.\n",
            "I'm terribly sorry you have this burden to deal with, but I'm glad your mother has a \"kid\" like you to help the family through this. First: Be kind to yourself. This is important. Your head is already feeling very full and heavy and ready to explode. You need to find a place to vent, or a routine that is just for you that you can go to to distract yourself from the pain and stress. Something that will keep you grounded and clear-headed. Secondly: Find Hospice. Talk to your mom about that. Hospice will counsel her, and you, and your dad, and whomever to get through this somehow. They will visit her at home and provide sound palliative care to her. They will keep her as comfortable as possible. They will provide respite care so you (and her other caregivers) can have a little time \"off\". If you'd like, someone will come to her for free to discuss what they do. You no longer wait until the very end to call them - they will be with her from the moment she decides not to pursue options that may or may not extend her life (which it sounds like is the case). I wish I had more substantial ways to help you. I'm a caregiver for my mother who is on Hospice, so that's where I'm coming from. Your dad needs to talk to someone - a social worker, or someone who can help him get through this. He is not your responsibility - just focus on your mom and your siblings for now. At least they'll know they have your support and love, which will help *them*. And you may be teaching him by example how to behave around them. I can understand your anger with him, for sure. But it could get volatile if you focus on him, you know? And let your siblings and mom support you too. It's ok to be emotional. Much love to you and your family. Again, this sucks, and I wish so much I could be more help.\n",

            "It may come as a surprise to her doctor that she won't be pursuing chemotherapy. Would your mother be interested in palliative chemotherapy, that is to say, its lower dose/ lower side effects with the intent of prolonging life/ improving quality of life but not seeking cure. It could be an oral medicine, so no going into the hospital for infusions. There will certainly be a role for some forms of palliative care to reduce pain. Surgery or radiation may be helpful if tumors are impinging on nerves or vessels causing pain. There will also be the issue of managing her pain as her disease progresses with pain killers. Everyone has the right to decide when their time to die is. Her physician and team will understand her decision and will make it as easy of a process as possible.\n",
            "So your doctor already answered your question then but it sounds like your struggling more with feeling of anticipatory grief and the realization that she may not be able to continue treatment physically (even tho she may want to mentally) and time is likely precious. There is no crystal ball to know how much time someone has with it without treatments. Sounds like it’s time to sit down with “her” (not sure if this is mom, wife, sister, friend, ect) and have a heart to heart conversation about what she wants to do and how she wants to spend the time she has left. The reality is that there is no cure for stage IV cancer, only treatments or acceptance of a comfort plan of care, and it will likely eventually take her life. Have you asked your doctor about a palliative care consult? They can sit down you with to discuss to burdens of treatment and if it’s worth the impact on her quality of life or if a plan of care focused more on her comfort and what she enjoys would resonate more with her. Or even an information visit with hospice so you better know when to call upon those services? Truthfully, there is something called a ECOG or performance status score for Oncologists and as someone’s symptoms increase, they are more bedbound, not eating much, ect it becomes unethical to offer treatment and so that will no longer be offered because the burden outweighs the benefit. She may reach that time too.\n",
            "Seconding u/CancerousKelly that you need to be her advocate and bring another provider onto her team to get her symptoms controlled. Have you looked into palliative care? The focus is pain management and symptom relief and while palliative care providers may be associated with hospice, one doesn't need to be on hospice to receive palliative care. See if there is a palliative care provider at your mom's oncology practice and if not consider asking the onc for a referral. Source: am oncology care manager \n",
            "Here's a small idea--not sure it's right for you all. Have you asked about palliative care for her through her providers? It sounds like she wants quality of life, and that's what palliative care is all about (it's NOT synonymous with hospice or end-of-life care). Perhaps if you can pull in a palliative care person, they can have her focus on goals, rather than focusing on chemo, or treatment more broadly. Just an idea. Wishing you and your mom lots of clarity in finding a solution!\n",
            "I am so sorry to hear this. Palliative care is definitely what you need, also talk to them about hospice plans and anythings that needs to be tied up. I hope that she can remain as comfortable as possible to the end.\n",

It might not work, but at this stage, there's nothing to lose. * If she values alternative medicine more than she values her life, then she could at least seek palliative care in a hospital. It's not a treatment, it will just make her life better going forward. This story breaks my heart and I share your pain. Be strong and be caring to her. To all the strangers who stumble upon this post: please, please do not use alternative medicine. Please seek actual treatment. If you have doubts, talk to people: here, at your hospital, at support groups. You're not alone. \n",
            "I think she knows she is loved. The most important thing you did for her and what you told us was laying in bed with her while she cried. You may not be able to come up with the food that she can eat or something that can help her sleep, but you can always be there. You can always comfort her with your presence. Is she consulting with the palliative care doctor? If not, that would be a good thing for her to do. That doctor can concentrate solely on her quality of life and try to help with her sleeping and her nausea. Oncologist can do that too but they are more focused on treatment whereas a palliative care doctor is only focused on comfort and quality of life. Another consult is with a nutritionist at the cancer center. They are very experienced in dealing with people like your mom and could have some good suggestions.\n",
            "Get the oncologist (from the hospital) to assign her a social worker and get into Hospice sooner than later. Even while in hospice she can still receive chemo, immunotherapy or other invasive procedures that fall under the palliative care umbrella. Hospice will help you tons and help her feel better and manage her symptoms. Their sole purpose is to help her and her loved ones to manage this horrible time in your lives.
