In September of 2014, I was diagnosed with pure embryonal testicular cancer in my left testicle; I was 30 years old at the time. Unfortunately, the orchiectomy was unsuccessful and the cancer had already metastasized to my lymph nodes. I underwent 9 weeks of BEP chemotherapy, which was successful(thus far) in taking care of the rest of the cancer. I am now in remission. Unfortunately, the bleomycin did a number on my lungs and I have been on prednisone for the last 4 months to help repair the fibrosis in my lungs. I have regained most of the function in my lungs, but still have a couple months of tapering the prednisone before I am finished. 

Before the cancer, I was lively, outgoing, social. Now, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I wake up ever night before 3 am and sit awake until dawn. I have no energy still and loathe having to go out and see people or travel. I feel like a shell of the person I used to be. I don't find any joy in life, which sucks because I have a 5 month old son (who was born during this whole ordeal) and a wife, both of whom, are amazing. If it weren't for them, I'd have taken my life months ago. I know this sounds like a cry for help, but it isn't. I don't intend on taking my life, I have too many responsibilities, and I wouldn't want my son to grow up without a father. I just think about it, ALL the time. 

This week, I went to see a doctor in the pain management and palliative care unit of the hospital I was treated and the doctor placed me on cymbalta. Hopefully this will help with the depression along with the neuropathy I have been experiencing because of the cisplatin.

Has anyone else gone through side effects like this? Did it get better? How long did it take? What did you do?",[deleted],t3_34nla1,4,2015-05-02 20:22:35,2,34nla1

I had the orchiectomy (pathology was non-seminoma - 90% embryonal, 10% yolk sac), then I had 4 cycles of BEP during which bHCG and AFP dropped dramatically but a month after chemo finished they discovered the nodes were actually teratoma which is not treatable with chemo. I had a 5cm neck lymph node removed first, then they attempted RPLND and failed. The urology surgeon said it was the biggest he'd attempted in his eight years of doing the surgery, they'd almost killed me in the operation due to blood loss, and it was therefore not resectable. They estimated I had six months to live and left me in the hands of palliative care. 

I believed them. I spent three months planning for dying, thinking about dying and trying not to think about dying. But I decided, basically for interests sake, to see a different oncologist interstate - I'd been told about him on the tc-cancer forum (they have a list of TC experts worldwide, use it). He referred me to his surgeon who told me it was worth a second attempt at the RPLND. By this stage I was definitely dying... I could barely eat, the tumour was approximately 28cm x 12cm x 10cm. Anyway, this different group of surgeons got it all out. I won't go into the emotion of it all... that's for another post but suffice to say getting a second opinion saved my life. I've since had about 18 spots in my lungs successfully removed too.

I learned that different groups of surgeons have different skill levels and if you are in a category like I was where your situation is beyond the norm, it is absolutely imperative that you seek out a second opinion. Good luck everyone.",untitledmfc,,8,2018-03-07 13:31:33,19,82o9ej

Thursday we find out what our options are.,"My partner has stage 3c testicular cancer. He’s 30 years old. He has pure Choriocarcinoma. Abdomen, lungs, liver, spine and brain all effected. 


He went through his first chemo regiment March- May 2019. It started out rough, in the ICU coughing up blood. But, the next three rounds he really bounced back. His tumor marker kept dropping, his tumors shrinking. We were thrilled


Getting ready for surgery in July, to remove residue masses. Then, seizure. He relapsed in the brain.


We leave our jobs, both self employed business owners. To move to NYC so he can get high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant at MSK.
It was so hard, but he did it, we did it. August -October 


He gets his surgeries, November - December, no live cancer found. He gets a PET scan, no cancer found. We are so certain he made it through.


Fast forward to now. 10months since his last chemo. His tumor marker skyrocketed. July it was 0, last Thursday 14,900. 


He has pain in his low back/ hip area and chest x-ray noted new nodules in his lungs.


Today his oncologist from MSK called us to tell us the news. We go to the city on Thursday now, for all the images, then a talk with him to go over the options.


He mentioned some immunotherapy clinical trials, possibly other palliative chemo options. But it’s going to depend on how extensive the disease is already. 


Told us he’s in a rough spot and the median survival tome is 6months. 


We just told his parents.

relieved I've found this subreddit as I've been battling with testicular cancer for almost a year now (Orchidectomy, 3x BEP, RPLND, 2x TIP and a tandem autologous stem cell transplant w/ high dosage chemo) Just out of the hospital from the latter and fearing end-of-life discussions. Dealing with a mixed germ-cell tumour. Choriocarcinoma as well as Teratoma. Very awesome, I know.

I'm 21 and have been told that if the latest interventions are unsuccessful, palliative care is the only option available. Anyone else been in my boat? One of my big frustrations is how little the docs can tell me. Apparently, the patient body for people in my position is so minuscule, that they cant even give me a clear prognosis (I've been quoted anywhere from 30-70%). Reaching out to see if anyone shares this frustration, or can give me any insight on terminal/end-of-life planning or care.",Dunkibear,t3_uv2s5q,10,2022-05-22 03:40:55,9,uv2s5q

Hope we're celebrating the good days and weathering the bad ones! I've got some good news I wanted to share with this group - After over a year of multiple chemo protocols and a couple surgeries, I am officially on surveillance! My most recent PET scan showed no sign of my cancer. Apparently, the high dosage chemo and stem cell transplant did something. Finally something that has worked! Its been such a long road of one devastating disappointment after the next. It feels like I'm on track to getting my life back, at long last.

They told me this was my last resort, that palliative care was the only alternative and this prognosis was reaffirmed with many a 2nd opinion. Just goes to show, it is never too late to have your fate turn around. I know exactly how hopeless it can feel, faced with so much ugliness, but as they say, it ain't over 'till the one-balled man sings. And I'm singing!

/r/subredditcancer/comments/9uhbz6/important_announcement/,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/9uhbz6/important_announcement/,subredditcancer,t5_2yv5q,Important Announcement,"It is with a great deal of reluctance and disappointment that we have decided to close r/SubredditCancer from this point forward. The moderators here have discussed this at great length and come to the inescapable conclusion that reddit is no longer a place for free discussion or the open exchange of ideas. The writing has been on the wall for a while now and it's time to face it.

As a consequence **we are locking and archiving the subreddit**. You will still be able to view the content, but we will not be taking new submissions from this point forward. All threads other than this one will be locked and this thread too will be locked in around three days

We've never been enthusiastic about heavily moderated platforms, but the precedent set by the reddit administration has made it abundantly clear that if we wish to stay out of quarantine (or worse) we have had to compromise those principles and to our great distaste give certain ""celebrity"" redditors preferential treatment.

We see no further point relinquishing our guiding vision and turning this subreddit into another ""safe space"" for ""acceptable"" opinions only.

For a while we had some hopes that things like the administration's [healthy communities policy](https://old.reddit.com/wiki/healthycommunities) would signal an attitude change in the right direction, but it's obvious now that it was little more than hot air that would only be enforced very selectively.

This subreddit has had little effect and has just become an exhausting list of the abuses of moderators and the outright indifference (at best) shown by the administration to this pattern of behaviour. Rather than being a place that might turn things around or shake reddit out of its apathetic decline into another Facebook substitute, we've been little more than a palliative care unit for people to congregate and watch it happen.

There have been other problems our contributors have brought with them. *This subreddit was never intended to favour one side of politics over another*, yet posters and commenters seem to think this is the place for pushing their personal agendas.

There are other subreddits and websites for that sort of thing.

-----

*I'd now like to include closing statements which were prepared by some of our other moderators in discussing this announcement*

Rather than selectively editing their statements, I'll let them stand as they were written:

( from u/FreeSpeechWarrior)

&gt; The hostility of Reddit's administration and the inexorable advance of moderator censorship render their verdict: we have chosen to discontinue treatment and archive r/subredditcancer
&gt;
&gt;The banning of hateful subreddits, or admins dismissing our concerns with dehumanizing language are not the hills that r/subredditcancer is dying on, they are the canaries in the coal mine that indicate the admins have no more sympathy for the views Reddit grew to prominence under and will never reverse course.
&gt;
&gt;The recent focus on hate communities on Reddit has deceptively fostered the false impression that Reddit still supports freedom of speech independently as an ideal to strive for.
&gt;
&gt;But our opposition to ""cancer"" on Reddit started as and has always been primarily subreddit cancer: the trends of insular, nepotistic moderation culture on Reddit censoring content in ways that lead to bias whether intentional or otherwise.
&gt;
&gt;For the past 5 years our community has worked to bring attention to this problem that the owners and administrators of reddit have refused to confront and instead choose to enable.
&gt;
&gt;In this time we've seen the admins turn a blind eye to the abuse and punishment that power mods dispense upon the average reddit user. They've encouraged communities to automate abuse through the use of software, allowing them to police the website in very dystopian ways under the banner of protecting people from words that have not yet been written.
&gt;
&gt;We've seen a succession of failed CEOs who have made the website progressively more user-hostile. The actions that led to the reddit Blackout of 2015 created a rift that reddit has been unable or unwilling to heal. Instead of standing up to mods who were holding the website hostage reddit capitulated and committed to building tools to help mods to further consolidate control.
&gt;
&gt;That's not to say that the admins and moderators bear all of the blame for the current state of reddit. There are users who abuse the platform and actively try to make it a hostile place for others. These days they're consolidated in the political subreddits and they are here only to attack and harass others. Some of them are welcome in the mainstream political subs because people agree with their particular brand of hate. There are others who are not so welcome, and as a result they're seeing their gathering places on reddit banned and quarantined. They're increasingly moving into r/subredditcancer to abuse our subreddit as a platform to harass others. As we observe the behavior of reddit wrt quarantines and bans it is our belief that SRC will not be allowed to exist for long outside of quarantine or ban if current trends continue.
&gt;
&gt;So it is with great sadness we acknowledge that reddit is beyond saving. We are at a point where the admins endorse the abuse of part of the reddit population by activist moderators. We are at a point where the admins are trolling our team here for daring to stand up for openness and transparency.
&gt;
&gt;We'd rather peacefully end the sub on our own terms in a way that allows our documentary efforts of past abuses to stand for posterity without giving pretext to censor and mischaracterize our past efforts as has happened to other controversial subs.
&gt;
&gt;We are immensely grateful for the support of those who have been with us as we tried to remain true in our mission to stand against abusive moderation of reddit.
&gt;
&gt;We don't know what the future holds, but we hope that everyone finds peace in whatever is to come.
&gt;
&gt;Those who are not ready to give up, we encourage you to find more effective outlets for expressing your frustration with the reddit community:
&gt;
&gt;**Admin sponsored subs:**
&gt;
&gt;* r/announcements

&gt;Over the years we've seen the admins turn a blind eye to the abuse and punishment that power mods dispense upon the average reddit user. They've encouraged communities to automate abuse through the use of software, allowing them to police the website in very dystopian ways under the banner of protecting people from words that have not yet been written.
&gt;
&gt;We've seen a succession of failed CEOs who have increasingly turned the website hostile and have worked to erase the vision that Aaron Schwartz had of a platform for open communication. The actions that led to the reddit Blackout of 2015 created a rift that reddit has been unable or unwilling to heal. Instead of standing up to mods who were holding the website hostage reddit capitulated and committed to building tools to help mods to further consolidate control. Steve Huffman, aka u/spez, violated the trust of all reddit users by changing people's words and then went on a campaign to erase one of reddit's most popular subreddits from visibility. He oversaw the sunsetting of the defaults, and at the same time, lifted rules that limited the number of the largest subreddits people could moderate. This solidified the power consolidation and that was the beginning of the end of reddit as a platform for open discussion.
&gt;
&gt;That's not to say that the admins bear all of the blame for the current state of reddit. There are users who abuse the platform and actively try to make it a hostile place for others. These days they're consolidated in the political subreddits and they are here only to attack and harass others. Some of them are welcome in the mainstream political subs because people agree with their particular brand of hate. There are others who are not welcome, and as a result have become so hateful that they're seeing their gathering places on reddit banned and quarantined. They're increasingly moving into r/SubredditCancer and abusing our subreddit as a platform to harass others.
&gt;
&gt;That's why it is with great sadness that we announce that we are archiving r/SubredditCancer. We aren't going private. We aren't going to try to get it banned to prove a point. We are going to turn it into a museum that showcases our lone attempt to try to preserve what made reddit great. Why? Because we've simply realized that reddit is beyond saving. We are at a point where the admins endorse the abuse of part of the reddit population by activist moderators. We are at a point where the admins are trolling our team here for daring to stand up for openness and transparency. We know there's nothing we can do.
&gt;
&gt;So, in closing, we want to thank those of you who have been with us as we tried to remain true in our mission to stand against abusive moderation of reddit. 

----

Some other mods may choose to leave comments regarding all of this in the thread itself.

----

Finally, I'd like to thank our genuine supporters and even our constructive critics, but mostly I would like thank the mods here who have done so much to help out. Several have already abandoned reddit and there was the one particularly bad apple, but that's history now.

----

Comments in this thread will be censored more heavily than usual to avoid hateful speech and harassment out of an abundance of caution to avoid any potential pretext for quarantining or banning our community.

This thread will be kept open for three days, we ask you to remain respectful and pay your respects or say your piece in the comments below.

/r/cancer/comments/ntln5/rough_day/,http://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ntln5/rough_day/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Rough day.,"I've been a lurker from time to time here, my mother was battling a rather rare form of cancer called ""cholangiocarcinoma""...it's a biliary tract cancer, a bit like pancreatic cancer but this occurs much closer to the liver, in, on and around the bile ducts. It also grows slower, much slower than pancreatic cancer.

And one of the hard things about it is that, even though it can exist for several years  in a person, when shit gets real, it takes people out incredibly swiftly. There aren't months in palliative care, or realizations that the battle is lost and that it's time to focus on time together. When it kills, it does so in a terrifyingly efficient manner.

It's been two weeks now since my mother passed away, three weeks ago we were all hanging out, planning Christmas, watching my 2 yo daughter run around in circles like a maniac. My mom was in the hospital on a Saturday night, the night of my wife's family Christmas Party, a bit against her will and insisting that it was just bad fish. Sunday, her heart rate spiked and she was put in the ICU. Monday night was the last time we could speak to her, and at that point we still figured that this would pass and we'd all be sitting around at Christmas. It wasn't until wednesday that I had any idea that my mother was dying, really.

Wednesday, the doctors sat us down and told us she would almost certainly not leave the ICU alive, and my father, sister and I had to live up to the promise that we would not make my mom sit in an ICU for weeks on end, hooked up to all sorts of equipment, to get a practically non-existent chance of survival. At that point, she had lost lucidity entirely...and the processes keeping her alive (dialysis and meds to keep her heart rate up) were such that they could not give her adequate palliative care, it was unbearable to watch and I don't even want to think of what it was like to go through. We lived up to our promise...the doctors took care of her pain and she quietly slipped away two hours later. It was so fast, I don't know if any of us knew what happened.

I've been holding it together, but I think that's partially because of the shock. Also, I've been slipping into some bad habits (self-medicating, I think, is the clinical term) that keep me rather numb. Yesterday, I sort of snapped out of that and today...well, the dam that I built with the drugs burst and a flood of emotions seems to have blindsided me.

Just needed to let some of it out somewhere I guess. I've been trying to keep it together for my dad, who is a complete disaster right now. Christmas, we didn't even observe it this year really, except with my wife's immediate family. My dad hung out at our house all day on Christmas, but it was so unfamiliar, nothing felt complete. We all broke down watching my daughter open the gifts my mother bought her (of course, those are her favorite now). It's just so unreal..

I know a lot of people here are still fighting, and I don't mean to depress anyone with stories of those who lost the battle. Like I said...it's just kind of overwhelmed me today. Figured this would be a decent place to get it out....thanks either way.

/r/cancer/comments/oyfcl/tijuana_cancer_clinics/,http://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/oyfcl/tijuana_cancer_clinics/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Tijuana cancer clinics,"Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I’m a graduate student and a reporter, and I’m trying to write an article about Tijuana’s “alternative” cancer clinics. Right now, I’m sitting in a motel a mile or so north of the border, decompressing after a day of visiting clinics. It has been fascinating, but I'd really rather hear from people who have ventured south of the border for cancer treatment themselves.

Some background and how I got interested in this: Cancer appears to run in my family. Uncle has it, grandmother had it, and a year and half ago my father died from esophageal cancer. Toward the end of my dad’s life, once the oncologists suggested we move to palliative care, my stepmother began frantically researching Tijuana clinics and begged him to attend one. He declined. (He never was one believe in miracle cures and I think he knew his time was short—even if we hadn’t accepted it yet.) 

She asked me to look in to/get in touch with a number of these clinics and my first reaction was righteous indignation. They appear to be prey on the most desperate members of society. The costs of treatment are exorbitant and there is little hard data to back anything up.

But now that I’ve met some doctors and nurses, everything is a little more…gray. No one (yet) has struck me as pure evil. Most folks seemed to really care about their patients and their work. 

So what I would really love is to hear your stories. If you’ve been to a Tijuana clinic or considered it, please share—or message me if you’d like to talk privately. 

TL;DR: I’m interested in Tijuana clinics and would love to hear from you if you’ve been.

I lost my mother to cancer when I was 6 years old. This was devastating to me as a child, as you may imagine. As a result my father could not cope raising myself and my older brother straight away so we lived with my grandparents for some time, seeing him every other weekend, until he had recovered and we lived with him full time. This situation did not lead to the best relationship between us and our father (especially between my brother and him) but I always felt he loved and cared for us, and now as I am older I understand what he was going through losing his wife and I my mother.

Now, on the verge of 25, my father has been battling late stage prostate cancer for the last few years. The cancer is fairly well developed and has spread to his bones, as such he has been in a palliative care ward for the last few weeks.

That said I am not entirely sure of why I felt the need to post my story here. I speak with my friends about the situation and I am lucky enough to have a few close friends who love me and I them, however this doesn't alleviate the pain. I simply don't think I will be able to cope with the loss of another parent, I feel lost. To clarify, I do not feel the need to cause any harm to myself, I just don't know what to do with myself.

I visit him in the ward a few times a week, I have dropped to the bare minimum days of work per week (3) so I can still survive and maintain the house while having enough time to spend with him. However some days I find myself unable to visit, as much as I love him some days I can't bare to see him in the state he is in. His dosage of painkillers is currently high enough to induce hallucinations and during visits he will sometimes get confused and answer questions that were not asked or ramble on about odd topics. It hurts so much to see the man I know and love reduced to this. I realise that choosing not to visit some days may seem selfish, and i'll admit it is, I just don't know what to do. I want to stay strong for him and be there for him but some days I can't hold it in and have to stay home.

I guess I just wanted to vent, tell someone other than my closest friends what I'm feeling and what I'm going through. I'm not ready to lose him. If I cant see him every day I call and its both comforting and painful to hear his voice. Every day he holds on is a bonus, and I hope he's around for my 25th in March and for some time after that.

And how?,"Reddit, I know this is long, but I need your help. Please read if you can and help me and my friend.

For the past few months I've been in alternating states of shock, depression and denial after my buddy (48 yrs old) told me he was diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer. He is feeling OK now and just has gotten off of a series of chemo, but everything I read tells me that the deck is stacked against him, eventually.

He has a pretty large family (who has only met me a few times) and I know that everyone is panicking right now and giving him one desperate advice over another. For instance, he has started going to church more often and embracing religion. I don't have anything against this but I wonder if there is anything else that can help him.

So I've heard and have done a lot of online research about 2 things: ketogenic diet and triptolide (thunder god vine). Both of these seem to have some promise in keeping the tumor from growing or even helping shrink it.

Some info:

http://robbwolf.com/2007/09/23/cancer-ketosis/
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-17/drug-from-chinese-thunder-god-vine-slays-tumors-in-mice.html

With regard to ketosis, I am a strict observer of the ketogenic diet myself (on r/keto) and for a long time have been reading of studies out there that show a correlation between blood glucose and cancer growth. So I'm very much a proponent of this diet in general, but especially for cancer. However, I usually keep this private to myself because people literally start treating me like a nutcase whenever I start arguing that a diet in high fat and very little carbs is good for you. 

With regard to triptolide, as the article says a water-soluble analogue to it called ""minnelide"" has been developed and is more potent/effective. Minnelide is scheduled to start clinical trials ""sometime in 2013"". 

So my initial thought is that given the doctors think he's going to die, there is no loss in the following:

* A) Go on a strict ketogenic diet
* B) Take ""thunder god vine"" root extract (aka triptolide)
* C) Talk to his doctors to see if they can enlist him in minnelide clinical trials

My friend probably won't be convinced himself unless his family (wife, brother, etc..) strongly get behind this.

So, here is what I'm asking you Reddit. 

1. Should I even intervene and ask my friend and his family to a) follow a strict ketogenic diet and b) somehow obtain triptolide and have my friend start taking it? 

2. Is this ethical? I hope his doctors can endorse this but even if they remain neutral and don't endorse it, does it really matter since the standard course of treatment is ""palliative"". I am in a big dilemma myself because I really don't know if these things will work (I pray that they do) and I have nightmares about the what-if scenario, where they may actually hurt him more? 

3. I wan't to prepare 2 folders of articles/research/facts about  a) ""ketogenic diet"" and b) ""triptolide/minnelide"", highlight the important text and then drop it off at my friends place, let them read it, then discuss and try to convince them. **Can you please suggest articles/news which you think are objective and will help convince my friend, his family, and hopefully his doctors to allow him to go on such a strict diet and take a non-standard medication?**

4. My biggest worry is that someone in his family may seriously think that I'm a nutcase. With so much vilification of dietary fat over the past 40-50 years, I have a serious fear that I may not be taken seriously.

My friend also seems to be in denial, sometimes. It makes me mad. His family is asking him to maintain a healthy diet (vegetables, ""low fat"", etc...). Never mind what I think about ""low fat"", but even with this advice, whenever we go out with me splurges on soft drinks and dessert, as if he doesn't care. While it pains me to see my friend do such unhealthy things in this condition, I keep mum because he is having a good time and I feel so bad that he may not have too many of those left.

Thanks in advance.",abnormalerror,,17,2012-11-22 12:50:31,10,13m9zj

Last February she was supposed to start treatment for stage IIIB cervical cancer but stopped after the external radiation. 

Instead she pursued ""alternative"" treatments- she's very into New Age stuff and din't have a pap smear for 30 years as she believed her reiki and reflexology and so on would let her know if there was a problem.

Welp, December 2011 she hemorrhaged and they discovered a 5+cm tumor.

Anyway, she went to this woman (a monster imho) who did  ""psychic surgery""- she laid hands on my mum, pushing around and so on, before pulling out the ""tumor"" and telling mum she was now cancer free.


My mum, being gullible and scared and vulnerable believed this woman and listened to her when she said that mum didn't need to go for the 6 month check up PET scan.


So, 2 days after Xmas 2012 my sister took mum into emergency as she was very ill and they discovered she had an ulcerated colon, a perforated bowel and septicemia- she was very close to dying.


Mum's bowel infection was so bad they couldn't operate for a week, all they could do was give her IV antibiotics, morphine and some sort of glucose mix. Nil by mouth the entire time.


She eventually went in for surgery and they rerouted her bowel and she came out with a stoma and had a colostomy bag attached.


During her stay they did numerous scans and around 10 days ago we found out her cancer had spread to the bladder, bowel and more lymph nodes.


Her cancer has been deemed inoperable and she's now in the care of the palliative team.


My mum is going to die soon- we're probably looking at months.


She's only 62 and I can't stand the thought of her dying in so much pain and fear. And I can't help but feel so angry at her for refusing to treat it when she had the chance. I sent her articles supporting the hospital's treatment regime, I begged her to have the chemo, even if it was just for her daughters and granddaughter's sake, but she is so stubborn and thought she was smarter than science. She even sent me an email criticising my attempts to convince her to undergo treatment and said she wasn't going to poison her body and line the pockets of ~Big Pharma~


Now she realises her mistake, but it's too late and it's breaking my heart.


Mum thought she had time to mess around and try everything else first but cancer doesn't take a break, so now I've got to take my little girl in to say bye bye to nana


How do you get through this? I feel like my life is breaking apart.


And I'm so sorry for everyone else here who is going through this godawful shit.

Tonight she cried. It's so hard to see. She says she feels so depressed that her heart hurts, but the tears won't come out. She says ""in my country (3rd world), we were starving, but we were happy. Here, we get everything we need, but I'm still the furthest from happy."" She also says, ""Why can't I die? Why do I have to keep living and suffering? (rough translation)""

She is not independent, and needs Mum to take care of everything. She no longer has hobbies (like watching TV - she used to love watching James Bond movies) because her eyes have become so bad. She can barely walk because of her muscle wasting away and the lack of energy. And to make things worse, she can't have all the desserts she loves due to her diabetes. 

She says the only person she has left is me (and Mum) - none of her other kids and grandkids visit, basically because they don't give a damn. To quote one of them, ""old people die. That's the way it is."" The majority of them haven't said a thing, not even phone call or text to wish her well or ask how she's doing.

What are some things I can do to make her happy? Currently, we take her out on a wheelchair to go shopping, but there's not much else that grandma does aside from eating and sleeping. I've suggested things from playing cards (which she used to love) to going to the beach on a mini-getaway, but she shows no interest in that kind of stuff.

I visit Mum and gran on weekends, but I go to uni an hour away. Worst comes to worst, I can just skip for a week or so.

Thanks for reading this, and thanks to anyone who can suggest anything. I'm really thankful for any kind of suggestion.

Also, the surgeon (not an oncologist) offered to give him some sort of Brazilian mushroom juice if we can get him in cash 140,000 NTD (roughly 3.7k USD) by Monday which supposedly helps with treatment which he only mentions to just my uncle when they're alone which I find incredibly suspicious.

I posted a few days ago about my mom's story. She had breast cancer a few years back and did really well with treatment. About a year ago she had a sore throat that kept coming back so she went to our GP who dismissed it. She then began having problems swallowing and eventually (a few months ago) went back to talk to the doc about it. He finally sent her to a specialist which took a few months and by the time she saw him she couldn't eat any solids and also had issues with liquids.


Initial tests showed a tumour around her voice box and talk of surgery, chemo and radiation began. We were told that aggressive treatment should do the trick. Further tests indicated the tumour extended from about her cheek bones down to the top of her lungs and that there isn't anything the doctors can do but palliative radiation. She has months to a year at most.


I am taking it pretty hard - I'm 27, a semester out from graduating from my masters with hopes of marriage and family in the coming couple years. I can't imagine getting married or having children without my mom and never thought I'd have to do it without her. She's only 55.


I have 3 younger siblings and feel somewhat responsible for them but it's hard to deal with my own grief and support them. I have already suggest my youngest brother go to a counselor at school (university) as he is the most unstable due to other issues in his life.


However the hardest one to deal with is my dad. He had plans to retire in January and then spend time with my mom and travel. He won't talk to us about it really but I can see how hard he is taking it and my mom has mentioned that I should try and help him - I just don't know how. We've overheard him talking to his grandson (4 months old) saying things like ""who's going to take care of me now"" or ""we've only had 30 years, she can't leave me now"". On top of this he gets so angry at the doctors - he blames the drugs she was on after the breast cancer battle. He blames the GP for not seeing it earlier. He blames the current doctors saying they should do more. When he  gets like that I get mad at him and don't even want to be around him.


I don't know what to do, we aren't that close to begin with - none of the children are so it's making it difficult to try and help him. The news is still new and I know it will get better but only before getting worse when she finally does go.


Part of me wants her to go soon, before it gets to the point that she can't move or is in more pain, before things start to look better only to come crashing down again. 


**tl;dr** My mom has months to a year left. I'm trying to deal with it while helping my 3 siblings and dad. Dad is taking it hard but isn't close to the kids, making it difficult to talk to him.

My mother has been fighting pancreas cancer for about 11 months, now metastasized to liver ++. After several tough battles with gemcitabine treatment and a failed folfox treatment (too high toxicity) there is nothing left to do but palliative care. 

The doctor told us ""unofficially"" about LDN and that he could not recommend it, but seing as there are -no- other options, he did want to tell us about one of his previous patients in the exact same situation having significant results from LDN after they themselves insisted on trying it. This means regaining appetite (cant eat/anorexic due to nausea), having enough energy to not only sleep through the whole day, generally increased quality of life. Our main concern is that it is indeed an opioid antagonist, and a morphine-pump (40 mg/ml concentration, 0,8 ml/h injection) is the only sufficient pain relief at the moment. The previous patient also used opioids as pain relief.

The risk of blocking out this relief with LDN is obviously terrifying, but since there are no real clinical trials, there seem to be mostly general warnings, and quite a few positive experiences (allthough mostly undocumented and hear-say), including this very real previous patient.

To complicate matters, my mother has been battling severe depression for years, worsened by the death of her partner this past June, and her mental state appears inexorably linked to feeling ""trapped"" in her current situation (I have a hunch that it was the somatic effects of grief that allowed the cancer to become so serious so quickly).

He lives out there and says that he has a number of friends who have cured themselves using alternative therapies, from juicing to vitamin dosing, to something called ""black salve"". I'm especially nervous about them trying to use the latter; the other alternative therapies are from a[ woman who was successful with her own cancer:](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rid-Yourself-of-Cancer/542922805760288).

Most of all, my mother is at the brink of a complete mental breakdown and believes that escaping to California is her only hope--I do believe that if she stays where she is and does palliative care, it's all over for her and she will have no quality of life. I know from lurking on this sub for a couple of days that most people feel negatively about alternative therapies. I guess I'm looking for any advice for those who have been at this stage with their loved ones--what did you do, what helped, what made things worse? 

tl;dr: My mom is terminal and so she's headed to California in hopes that it will offer better quality of life as well resources for alternative therapies. Is there any hope?

When I went to talk to his oncologist regarding his pain medicine, I decided to ask the doctor the prognosis. He told me, without hesitation or doubt, that the cancer was inoperable and the disease terminal. I was stunned. I asked the doctor whether my brother knew, and he said no. He wants to tell him after the course of chemo and radiation (there's about 5 weeks to go).

Now that I know the prognosis, what do I do? Should I tell my brother what I know? Sometimes I think he has a right to know and make decisions based on all the facts, and other times I think that if he wanted to know, he would ask his doctor. 
I don't believe he ""knows"" he is dying. He talks of kicking cancer's ass, and as much as I want to encourage him and give him hope,  I don't want to mislead him. When he finds out in 5 weeks that he is terminal, I don't want him questioning why I withheld this information, nor to be mad at me for allowing him to go through what is a brutal course of chemo and radiation. Not to mention the breakthough pain because the tumor is crushing his spine.

Sometimes I feel he'd be better served with hospice or palliative care. Other times, I want him to fight like hell even though it is almost certainly in vain.

So, when do I say the T word? Do I ever say it? Leave it to his doctor? Any wisdom would be much appreciated.

EDIT: Just to clear things up, I had an advance directive, so the doctor was allowed to share any information about my brother with me. What I am grappling with is the fact that he told only me, and not my brother, which leaves me in the VERY awkward situation of telling him myself, or letting him believe there is hope despite the prognosis.

/r/cancer/comments/1u5doa/are_we_in_denial/,http://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1u5doa/are_we_in_denial/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Are we in denial?,"Long story sorry guys.  My mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and we are curious if the evidence that we see is anecdotal and contributing to our denial...  From everything I read, my mother is a rarity on this pancan journey.

Quick background.  My mother is white (irish) 54yrs old, non-smoker, non-drinker, has had a full hysterectomy, appendectomy, and the only chronic illness sustained is osteopinia.

In July of 2012 she visited her doctor due to a month long chest cold with sharp pains in her lower chest, high fever, and other signs of infection.  After the typical trial of antibiotics, she was given a CT scan which showed a mass at the head of the pancreas and small masses (lesions) in the liver.  Immediately the doctors (due to absolute incompetence in my eyes at least) told my mother they suspect pancan and scheduled a biopsy.

From my understanding, the pancreas was pushed to an abnormal area and only one FNA was conducted.  The FNA read 'indicative of adenocarcinoma' and something along the lines of 'poorly differentiated.' CA-19-9 was at about 40k

Due to the stage IV diagnosis, the doc (again with the utter incompetence) told her she likely had 3 months to live.  We talked to numerous other doctors in the same TRICARE network, but none would refute the evidence, or conduct their own testing. Hospice was a likely call but instead we went the palliative chemo route.

My mother did two stints of Fulfironox.  But she still had horrible pain, as well as a very high fever.  Before continuing on with the chemo, we admitted her for the fever and found she had a really bad infection in the gall-bladder, that the emergency doctors, and radio docs said looks to have been going on for a while due to a lot of scarring.  When installing a drain tube to drain the infection, the doc pulled out almost 2 full syringes of brown puss...  Something he said he has never seen before.

Even with the drain tube, the infection kept reoccurring.  All the while, over the course of about 3 months, my mother remained asymptomatic (minus pain.)  She gained weight, had healthy liver function, was active, energetic, etc.

My mother made the decision to have her gall bladder removed due to the pain...  Finding a doc to do this was quite the hassle, due to the stage 4 diagnosis.  While finding a surgeon my mother took 6 more chemo treatments.  Her CA-19-9's were in the 90 range.  

She took a break from chemo to have he gall bladder removed.

During the surgery, the surgeon said the liver was spotless, and the pancreas was as well.  So they could not take anymore FNA's...  The last CT also confirmed with ""no progression of disease.""

During the surgery, they accidently clamped the main bile duct, causing a myriad of issues post operation, including jaundice, weightloss, infection etc.  She was put under again a month later to have a stint installed to allow proper function...

While all this is going on, the main oncologist was reading the blood markers, and seemed to disregard the increased CA-19-9's as surgery related and came to the conclusion that ""the cancer is back."" So, out of fear, we continued almost immediatly with the chemo.

Fast forward to today.  Her tumor markers have seemed to stabalize in the 50-80 range, and the doctor has put her on a maintenance treatment of capcitabine.  This is after a total of 20 Fulfironox treatments.

Since the surgery (the biggest impact) she has lost nearly 50% of her baseline weight, lost a lot of motivation, and is basically living day to day...  I attribute this to chemical poisioning, and not diesease.

So now here we sit.  A long past the inititial 3 months diagnosis, but still in quite a pickle.  To recap and TLDR...

1.  Her diagnosis is based on anecdotal evidence...  No ruling out of pancreatities, gall-bladder infection, or a myriad of other digestive issues.

2.  Every cancer related symptom can be easily attributed to infection; raised tumor markers, surgery recovery, gal/bile infection, pancreatities.

3.  She abnormally reacts to treatment. Fulfironox only causes slight side effects for one week out of the month (it is supposed to be the harshest most aggressive treatment.)  The maintenance treatment (supposed to be taken for the rest of her life) destroys her, even though it is supposed to be mellow.  With this maintenance she is in a daily battle with fatigue, nasuea, constipation, hand and foot syndrome (a biggie.)

4.  The CT scans can be attributed to benign liver lesions...  With only one FNA the error margins are huge.

5.  She does not fit the mean criteria for those at risk for pancan.

6.  Without treatment, she remains asymptomatic, even gaining substantial appetitie and energy.

Right now EVERY time we bring up these concerns we are immediatly cast aside as deniers.  To the point the doctor pretty much takes offense.  The only good right now, is the oncologist will basically allow us to control the treatment, on the condition we provide studies showing effectivness on pancan...  hence the 'maintenance' regimen.

Basically we feel that something isnt quite right...  From everything we have read, she should be dead (based on diagnosis.)  Short of a miracle we believe a misdiagnosis, but cannot really hold our ground in fear of a real cancer killing my ma.

I posted the below message on AskReddit the other day...it hasn't gained a lot of traction (I'm not sure how long that usually takes), so I thought I'd post it here as well. Any advice or help you can offer would be amazing!

Thank you in advance. 



Hey Reddit,


I've been a lurker for quite some time. I've posted a couple of BS items...nothing major. Just more to see how it all works. I’m posting today with something serious though, and any and all help is very much welcome and appreciated.


I’ve got a very good friend whose husband has just been diagnosed with cancer. The guy is 40 years old, and they have a 1 year old daughter together.


I don’t know all the details or all of the medical jargon, but here’s a somewhat basic summary of what’s going on:


- Pain in the stomach started at the beginning of December
- Toward the end of December, the pain was unbearable
- Tests were done and it was determined that there were tumours on the liver and lymph nodes (and, I believe, also on the lungs)
- More tests were done and results were received on January 8th: they’re looking at incurable cancer and palliative care


What I’m asking is, those of you that have had incurable/untreatable, aggressive cancers, how did you survive? I know what palliative care is, but people sometimes pull through these things, right? Stranger things have happened. My friend is trying to stay optimistic, and is open to anything that might help...natural or holistic remedies, probably even god damn healing crystals if there was even the slightest hint of them working.


So Reddit, please tell me, what was the secret to your survival?

*Edit: my friend and her husband have received the official diagnosis; it's stage 4 pancreatic cancer. They're meeting with oncologists this week (the week of January 13th) to see about treatment options. 
Thanks to everyone who's replied so far - your stories, kind words, and thoughts are very much appreciated!",organizatron,t3_1uw0g0,20,2014-01-10 16:13:27,4,1uw0g0

He developed a persistent cough during october and finally went to the doctor late december. They drained a lot of fluid from his lungs and performed a series of tests. This past tuesday they finally told us the diagnosis and started the carboplatin chemo in 3 week cycles. 

Good news is that he feels and looks great. Solid energy, minimal coughing, and during the check up they found he was no longer leaking any fluids. In addition, the cancer is confined to his right lung. 

A coworker told me he was also diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and all they did was remove the lung, he is still kicking 12 years later. My dad's oncologist suggested palliative care from this point forward but we were not happy with her. She takes weeks to reply and forgot to ask for pt/ct scans and to prescribe him the proper medication.


I understand the statistics of survival but we wan't to try everything. My question is why can't we remove the lung? The doctor replied with a one sentence email ""we can't because it's stage 4"".

She recently had genetic testing done, and had appointments to see if she could have a mastectomy done (she had breast cancer in one breast at age 25, and has a 73% chance of getting it again). Today the tumor board denied the surgery, saying she had more tumors and that she needed to start Taxotere this coming Tuesday. 

The thing is, they offered her hospice, if she didn't want chemo. Does this mean they expect her to die soon?

I talked to her, and she is choosing the chemo, and she said her doctor said that if she was against doing chemo again, she could forgo it at home or hospice. She can still do everything she always has, within reason, so I don't think she wants to go to hospice.

He had a stroke while in waiting room that paralyzed his right side. He had been fully mobile and in fair to good health prior. While treating for stroke they found small cell lung cancer which has metastasized to liver, brain, bone, and maybe some other areas.  

He lives 4 hours away. My brother flew into town, met doctors, and with Dad decided to embark on chemo and radiation for cancer in brain.  The goal was not to cure but to gain some time and quality of life.  Doctors opinions varied but we were told 0 to 6 weeks w/o treatment and 3 to 9 months if the chemo and radiation were effective.  He has had 2 chemo and radiation so far and its unknown whether they have been effective yet. Lots of divergence of opinion by doctors. 

Some mobility in right arm and toe movement in right foot implied that we could make some progress with physical therapy.  The chemo and radiation have made that difficult to work on.  Oh yeah. He probably had pneumonia when he went in, but definitely had after he was there a few days.  Antibiotics and diarrhea followed by constipation. Life is miserable for him right now. 

I've visited and spent many days in the hospital with him the past month.  As bad as the cancer is the most f'ed up part is the stroke has made him bedridden and helpless.  Lots of pain now associated with lying down all/most of the time. W/o the stroke we could get him to chemo,  give him palliative care, and eventually hospice mostly out patient style. The stroke dramatically increases the need for hour by hour care to help with basic functions. 

The hospital wants to discharge him because he is not making any new progress with physical therapy. The goal with therapy was to get him to the point where he could sit up on his own to make it easy enough to get him in a chair for bathroom, etc.  we have fought with the hospital about giving up on therapy because getting a little movement would have a dramatic impact on his remaining QOL and he has shown that his limbs are not 100% paralyzed.  They have been generally good but they view us as adult children in denial. I think we have a rational perspective on his possible outcomes but realize that giving up on rehab precludes anything but a bedridden end of life.  

So, our hope is to get him into a rehab hospital in our town to eliminate massive traveling logistics.  Then skilled nursing care with rehab.  My personal feeling, slightly at odds with my brother, is to get him out of the hospital to one of our homes, modify a bedroom and bath to accommodate his needs, provide for skilled nursing, aides, and physical rehab at home.  My brother is financially successful and has the financial resources to make that happen.  

I feel like this is the best psychological environment and that although we won't have a fancy rehab gym we won't need it because his range of motion is so limited we are looking for movement and not strength building.  We will have more control over the nurses and aides then in a hospital. We are not fighting over the strategic decision but I am acquiescing to the more aggressive approach which i feel maximizes his shot at partial recovery at the cost of current QOL. 

Dad has 95% of his cognitive function intact but I think because of his fatigue his ability to think through the pros and cons of where to get treatment is limited. He has said he doesn't want to be a burden by living in one of our houses but I think he discounts the burden we will have with having to visit him in a facility that he will be unhappy in and the frustration that goes hand in hand with finding out that the nurses don't come to him quickly enough when he is pain, the rehab guy is abusive, etc. 

I am looking for the advice and experience that my fellow Redditors have had.  Should we continue in rehab hospital and skilled nursing facility or try to do this at home?    Lots of unknowns.",Stairwayscaredandare,t3_2bhef2,0,2014-07-23 10:10:04,10,2bhef2

They moved her onto another type of chemo cocktail and localized radiation therapy until 1 month ago, but it did not respond what so ever, if anything it spread faster than the first chemo treatment she was on.

After her last consultation they have found about 30 spots on her liver up from 5-10 6 weeks ago, it's so enlarged it is contacting her diaphragm causing shortness of breath and excessive pain. They've prescribed her 15mg of morphine every 4 fours and Ativan as needed to reduce anxiety. They deemed the treatments as unresponsive and recommended it's time to move onto Palliative care. They expect she doesn't have much time left. 

Rewind a little bit: my parents flew to Toronto for a second opinion after initial diagnosis and they stated the treatments given by the Cancer Institute in Edmonton, were exactly what they would have suggested. They agreed with the first chemo treatment - but it doesn't necessarily mean they would agreed with the second type of chemo/radiation therapy.

I know my mom will pass away but I don't want to happen this year, I want to fight this fucker and try lengthen my Mom's life. I found this very promising article tonight and want to direct it to my mothers Doctor ASAP and ask why none of this was looked into (in as polite a way as possible) and see if it is a possibility. I'm sure they must know of such procedures and overlooked them due to interactions? Maybe it's to distant to allow surgery? either way shouldn't they have at least given us options instead of simply chemotherapy!?

Obviously I'm still pretty angry at her choices because her death wasn't a forgone conclusion and if she'd just had 12 weeks of 1/2 dose chemo she'd still be here. It's hard not to take your mum refusing treatment personally, even though I know it was her fear that prevented her from doing so (she would talk about ~big pharma~ and the ~cancer conspiracy~ How can you reason with that?)

Anyway, I stayed at the palliative care centre for the last 5 days of her life and I ended up sending my younger sister away for the last part as she was finding the physical side of it very difficult to handle- I was able to swab mum's mouth and help close her eye when it would open etc whereas my sister couldn't cope with that side of it.
Anyway, I thought mum would eventually lose consciousness and take her last breath and pass away.

Well, it didn't happen that way. It was brutal. She was partially conscious the whole time, she started groaning and gasping for breath, as if she realised she was going and decided at the last minute to fight it.

I can't tell you how awful it was- there was no sense of peace, no serenity, just a horrible, painful struggle not to die.
Meanwhile, I have had 3 major surgeries in the last 2 years, one 2 weeks after my mum died (to the day). So it's been really tough. I've lost my business and partial use of my left leg, I'm on high dose opiates due to the orthopedic surgeries not healing...

IDK, it's been pretty shitty.

SO, I'm driving my car the other day and just as I hit the freeway merging lane I have this intense feeling of anxiety and images of my mum's last moments start flashing through my mind. I felt like I was about to burst into tears, and I couldn't seem to hold it back.

I grabbed on to a CD (The Chemical Brothers) and turned it up as loud as it would go and was able to keep it together so I could drive (which worked, thankfully).

But it was really scary, suddenly reliving those emotions and feeling so overwhelmed, especially at 100kmh on the frigging freeway.

Has anyone else experienced flashbacks like these? How do you stop them?

I haven't had any grief counseling at all, and I have been depressed and anxious (I live with mental illness anyway) but I just can't go there- I am so angry and just devastated by my mum's choices and her pointless, stupid death, I feel like if I started to ~Feel My Feelings~ I would be swamped, I would drown in them and I'm scared to face it all.
Any advice on dealing with these unwanted experiences of anxiety and reliving the death again would be great.

She's only 71. Diagnosis was made a little more than a month ago. She does know that she has a cancer, but does not know how bad it is. 

Surgery was considered, but gastroscopy showed an acute ulcer and she was told she need to treat that before surgery. A week later her condition suddenly and severely worsened. Doctors say that the surgery is no longer an option and only palliative care is possible. She doesn't know that yet.

She can not walk anymore, and barely can talk. I believe that cancer already metastasized into brain. She has difficulty breathing and almost can not coughing up mucus.

What I fear most is the moment when she finally realizes that her condition is fatal. I cannot bring myself to tell her that. Don't know if I should, also. I knew it was not a 'good' cancer and that the surgery probably won't do much, but I have not told her that. She thinks that she just got extremely unlucky to have surgery delayed due to some simple ulcer and that the doctors were incompetent. (I tend to agree with her on that. I'm in Russia, and our 'free' health care is terrible by first world standards).

I probably should not ask for advice on how to talk to her about that. I know she trusts me. I just can not walk to her and say 'you know, you are going to die'. But I also hate lying, and by lying I deprive myself from the possibility to prepare her.

I know mostly what to expect from when the family did hospice care for my grandparents, and my aunt (his sister) was a hospice nurse for a long time. Nobody is willing to guess on a timeline, but anyone that has seen him decline in the past week can tell its not going to be very long.

I'd just like to get the opinion of the unknown masses, because I think family might not be totally objective. Am I doing the right thing by opting for palliative-only care? I know that on my own I would try to be by him 24-7 caregiving, what kind of limits should I set myself? The doctors seemed hesitant when I brought up the subject of medical marijuana to improve his appetite, and possibly pain. I have pretty easy access to marijuana oil caplets, should I dose him, or will it make things worse, or will it be a wasted effort considering the massive amounts of opiates he's already getting? Is there anything else the community would suggest that I'm probably not thinking of?

I appreciate all your feedback, I'm about to go to the hospital and discuss his discharge and hospice care there as well, I will be back in a bit more than 12 hours, so please excuse me if I look like I'm ignoring this post, and thanks. ",just_some_Fred,t3_2csg3d,6,2014-08-06 14:32:26,4,2csg3d

Last week my father (who is 56) was diagnosed with cancer in his liver and in his colon after an ultrasound identified lesions on his liver and a mass in his colon. We are still waiting on the CT scan/biopsy results to confirm basically everything else, but the doctor has been talking about ""palliative care.""  

This whole diagnosis came about because my dad finally went to the doctor after gradually losing his appetite over the summer, and then suddenly losing almost 15 pounds in the span of two weeks. He has also been experiencing pain in his abdomen, pain sitting down, and lots of burping (?).

I am really scared about what is going to happen. My dad has always been a heavy smoker, and just this past winter quit drinking after several years of heavy alcoholism. It just makes me so sad that he was doing so well, then to get smacked with all of this. I made the mistake of Googling liver cancer as soon as the diagnosis came through and it sounds like once you are showing symptoms you are pretty far along....

I am also very worried that my parents are not being honest with me about the situation. I live in New England and they live in the South, so I am pretty far away. They keep telling me no, don't come home, save your trips for when he is very sick, but then yesterday my mother texts me that a pastor friend agreed to run dad's memorial service! It just all seems so backwards.

I'm not really sure what else to say, I just wanted to stop by and say hello. I'm having a hard time communicating how I feel to everyone else in my life so I thought that maybe this would be a good place to vent some steam.

Thanks so much for reading, and any advice that you may have for someone who is new to this is much appreciated.

This past Sunday she went back in, this morning they drained her lungs again and placed drain tubes in.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/2dz7k3/father_diagnosed_with_livercolon_cancer/) is my last post. Thank you to everyone for your kind words and thoughts, you really helped me to clear my head.

My father FINALLY received his biopsy results last night. The primary site of his cancer is a sarcoma behind his sacrum. The sarcoma has spread to his liver, colon, lungs, and stomach. We still do not know what type of sarcoma (whether it is soft-tissue or bony-tissue) because his doctors sent the sample off to Emory for a final review since this is such a rare type of cancer. We should receive the final pathology report within the next few days. Based on the information we have now, his doctor has indicated that the cancer is not curable and that without treatment, my father has less than a year left of life. 

Unfortunately, my father is not a candidate for surgery since the cancer has spread so far. At this point, his doctor would like for him to consider both chemo and radiation for palliative care only. He has begun to feel very tired, and has been feeling pain when he sits down. He has an appointment with a medical oncologist next week, but is considering refusing treatment since it would really only be prolonging the inevitable. I have very mixed feelings about this. Obviously I love my dad and want as much time with him as I can possibly get, but I also understand that he does not want to spend the next year feeling like poop and spending all of my parents' money on treatments and specialists that can't do much. 

I will be going home for four days next week to be with my family. In my last post, I indicated that my parents did not want me to come home (I live in Boston, they live in South Carolina) until he started feeling very ill. But I decided that I want to see him while he is still feeling a bit like himself. I just wanted to say thank you for everyone who helped to point me in this direction. Obviously this is a lot to take in at one time, but your kind thoughts and words and prayers really mean a lot to me. ",rosythewench,t3_2g00yd,4,2014-09-10 12:42:04,3,2g00yd

They discovered a mass the size of a baseball on the right bronchial. Fluids containing cancerous cells are in/around the right lung, putting pressure on it and eventually collapsing it. 3 lesions discovered in the brain. Initial treatment plan was to drain fluid, put in a drain port, then hit the brain with radiation and the lung with chemo. 6 months to live if they could have done that. Then he was too unstable for the port and that was really just about it. That removed any other options. He was on bipap since yesterday morning and it's just been a constant downhill slide. We just took him off it and he's on hi-flow oxygen only through nasal cannula. They moved him to palliative care. We just got there. He's heavily sedated and surrounded by family but I'm losing it right now. My dad's a cop and I'm a police dispatcher and my aunt is a nurse and we've all seen some shit but we're all breaking down because everything is happening so fast. I just need people to talk to but nobody else really gets it.

Edit: My grandfather passed away Friday September 26 at 6pm surrounded by his loving family, including his wife of 68 years. He was 83.

As his suffering ended, so did ours. There was no more false hope. There was no more fear that he was in pain. He was free of all that, and in that moment, so were we all. Now is the hard part, the part we hadn't expected to be going through so soon. The planning of the funeral. The news spreading to friends and family. Picking out an urn. It's hard, but in a way it's so much easier than that last week in the hospital, because we know now for a fact that he's okay, and we don't have to worry any more.

From what I understand, the doctors found he had an ulcer and based it off of that. The next few weeks were filled with multiple hospital visits and blood work. I was confused yet wary about all this testing. He was getting weaker everyday and I had a feeling he had something more. On October 30th, my mom calls me before my afternoon class. She wants me to come home right away because they found out he has stomach cancer. I didn't expect that. 

During the first week of November I was busy with school and work, so I never got a chance to visit the doctor with my parents. I wanted to know how far along it was and all the little details. All I knew was that he had a tumor in his stomach and it was blocking food from going into his intestines. I was trying to be optimistic, although I realized I was also in denial of how serious it was. It didn't help that my fiance was convinced that my dad had Stage II cancer, judging from the doctor's papers and his internet research.

The rest of November passed by extremely quickly. Before I knew it, my dad's round and full face became gaunt. He lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time. His stomach would constantly fill up with fluid and extend out like a balloon. That was causing him a lot of pain. He would only have appointments to drain the fluid once a week. They usually drain out about 2 liters of fluid. 

In the middle of November, my father told me he has about a month left. I looked at his recent papers and saw the words ""terminal"". He has Stage IV cancer, not fucking Stage II. I was angry at myself for being in denial and I couldn't help but be angry at my fiance for telling me the wrong thing. I felt like if I would have known how serious it was, I could have spent more time at home with my dad. 

Moving on, my dad went to the hospital on the Monday of Thanksgiving week. I was able to stay overnight with him Wednesday through Sunday of that week, which made me happy and I hope it made my dad happy. During his stay there, they put a stent in his stomach so fluids can pass through more easily. They also put in a catheter so when his stomach swells, my mom and I could drain it at home. Ultimately, my parents decided to proceed with hospice/palliative care instead of chemo.

My dad has been home since December 3rd. I spent Dec 6-7 and Dec 10-11 with my fiance at his place instead of at home with my dad. I realized that I cope by avoiding or escaping to places away from the source of pain or whatever. I'm writhing in regret and thinking ""WTF"" to myself since I should be spending time with my dad. 

Honestly just yesterday it really starting to hit me that I'm going to lose him forever. He has lost his ability to swallow anything. Without water, I know the time is close by. Also this morning, he forgot where he was and who I was. I feel I have so many things to tell him but I can't think of anything. I wanted to say these things while he was still aware and ""here"". God I hope I haven't missed that window...I'm going to see how he is feeling later today. 

I'm so scared guys. I'm ready yet I'm not. I have never felt so much pain in my life and I can only imagine what my mom feels. I think my dad is ready though so that's good. He seems comfortable and calm. I like to think that we're taking care of him well. 

Overall thank you for reading. I'm sorry if my grammar sucks. I didn't sleep much last night and it's pretty tough to think clearly. I'm happy to give support and receive it too.",tippeh,t3_2p66ef,4,2014-12-13 13:39:32,7,2p66ef

The doctors immediately told her she had ovarian cancer and she refused to hear it for nearly 7 weeks, refused treatment, and even fired multiple doctors every time they brought it up. She believes in her holistic lifestyle, and claims that it will cure her cancer. 

She finally called me nearly a week ago and said she was in the hospital and they were refusing to care for her. She lives about 2 hours away from me so I immediately drove to her and spend the next 5 days trying to sort her out. She now wants treatment but has lost nearly 50% of her body weight, and the cancer is spread all over. The oncologist says at this point there's no way to cure her because surgery is not a option, but palliative chemo is a option. It seems like her only option is to try chemo and get her weight back on at the same time, so she can receive surgery but that seems like a dismal long shot and I'm so scared that the chemo will do way more harm to what short time she has left. On top of that, she dis-enrolled in medicare part B quiet some time ago, and it seems like the only chemo she could possibly receive would be inpatient chemo, requiring her to goto the hospital? Is this what ""inpatient chemo"" actually is? She is currently in the hospital now but they are pushing to discharge her soon and she will be moving to a assisted living facility immediately.

I will lose my father in the next couple of days. He has peritoneal carcinomatos (the main tumor could not be found, but he has metastases in the entire abdominal area).

He left the hospital because there was no chance of treatment in his age, so we have him at home, supported by a wonderful nurse and palliative doctor. The pressure on this abdominal area now hurts the organs and they are not functioning any more.

I want to prepare for the next days, and I always feel that knowledge helps me dealing with scenarios like this.

How will the last days look like? He is very thin already, can barely eat. Will he at some point get unconscious because of a lack of nutrition and muscle strength to breathe? Or will it be more of a sudden final moment? I understand that it all is very vague, that I can not really know what and how it will happen.

Overall he lived a pretty long and good life. He is not negative in the final weeks, encourages us to stay positive and go our ways.

She has around six months, maybe a year, to live. Her chemo is palliative, just for symptom/pain management.

One night, I just heard it was cancer. Then the next morning I got a call saying she was dying, no denying or doubting. I spent that next weekend a wreck. This is the grandmother that I grew up with. Not one of them that you visit a few times a year. When I found out, my grandpa said they were planning on surprising me at my nursing school graduation in August. That just cut to the core of my heart.
They recently came to town for her treatment. While here, I've been trying to do whatever I can to help them. Whatever they ask for, whatever I even THINK they need.
Since I am the granddaughter, I hardly see or hear her fear and discouragement except through other family. It's been rough just hearing about it. She's a lady that loves absolutely everyone-you know the kind, that nursing staff LOVE working with, that makes friends EVERYWHERE.
Since she got to town, I've tried to visit for at least a little while every single day. 

So far, I've seen her as frail instead of the strong happy woman I've always known. I've seen her have to eat nothing but soft foods if she can even get that down. I've seen her self conscious about emptying an ostomy bag. I've seen her drugged up so much because of pain. I've seen her loopy because of the antianxiety meds she had to take due to her sister  asking to borrow money claiming she was hungry (surprise surprise, she wanted it for weed). 
The other day, I visited and she looked so discouraged, so scared and depressed. I then had to step into a new role in life: source of strength and reassurance for a dying loved one. This was gut wrenching for me. I cried myself to sleep and feel myself becoming more and more often depressed.

I am still trying to get through nursing school. I do what I can to get ahead while not visiting my grandmother but I feel like I am just... barely keeping my head above water. And I don't know how to deal with the depression/grieving. Nursing school only teaches us how to help others in this regard-nothing has prepared me for this.

I just needed to vent. If you have any insight, it's always appreciated.

I am an only child whose father has been fighting a brain tumor (oligodendroglioma) for 23 years.  Recently, he's been given palliative care and it seems there aren't any options left. He's beginning to take it out on my mom, and she is beginning to break down. I live on the other side of the country and I don't know what to do.


**long version**

For almost as long as I can remember, my dad has been off/on with cancer. When I was young he had a really successful surgery that ended up giving him a new lease on life. About 10 years ago he started to get wildly different opinions on his regular MRI scans, from doctors claiming that nothing was wrong to people saying that he needed gamma knife surgery immediately. He refused to have surgery again because how much it had changed him previously (and because of the wildly different diagnoses). For 10 years after that, he seemed like my normal dad. He was always good natured and had a particular black humor around his condition. 


About a year ago, his MRIs returned with a very fast growth. He got put on chemo but was taken off of it because it didn't help.


Since then, his condition has been rapidly deteriorating. What was once absent-mindedness has turned into blanking in the middle of conversations. His mood has generally become very volatile and he is quick to become frustrated. According to my mom, he will fervently correct people with wrong information. He's also been saying things which I would never would have imagined him saying before, the worst being ""I wish you were dead"" (to my mom). He's had his license revoked for getting into multiple accidents in a short period of time.


My mom is quickly becoming exasperated. She waffles between ""I'm strong, and I can take it"" to calling me and screaming until she bursts into tears. For a long time I thought my mom was abusive, because  every argument would devolve into yelling something was wrong with his brain. From what I am learning now, it seems that his initial surgery actually changed him a lot, and the man that my mom married actually left 23 years ago. All I've ever really known is post-surgery dad, which made me not see it, and drove my mother insane. 


Now that his condition has gotten worse, my mom can't take it. She's told me that her counselor and case worker have told her to move out. I have no idea how this would work, as his drivers license was revoked by the state because of his condition. I do not think he can take care of himself. She is continuing to take care of him, but keeps talking to me about how she is being driven crazy. English isn't her first language (and I don't know her first language... stupid me) so when she gets incredibly frustrated it becomes really hard to understand the difference between venting and things that I should call 911 for.

But hopefully one/some of you can help me decide what to do...I've been torn over this ever since my diagnosis last year.


April 2012: I got a little cough, nothing alarming, the sort of cough that'll sometimes stay with you a few weeks after you fight off a cold. 


July 2013: The cough had become something I'd learned to live with, except this time I had a coughing fit so bad I actually felt like I'd injured a rib. I went to the clinic for an x-ray; they said everything looked fine, and said my rib was probably just bruised. 

(Couple weeks later) I start seeing a pulmonologist, who does some lung capacity tests, then starts throwing medications for different conditions (allergy, asthma, acid reflux) at it to see if anything works. I didn't have insurance back then, so I spent over $1000 on meds and inhalers that didn't do anything. 

During one visit, I asked him if I might have cancer...I'd read an article about the increasing number of lung cancer diagnoses for young Asian female nonsmokers. I was 28, am an Asian female, and have never smoked. He asked if the clinic had indicated anything on my x-ray, and I said no; he said that meant we could safely rule out cancer. I felt silly for even suggesting something so dramatic. 

August 2013: The coughing gets worse, often building into uncontrollable fits ending in gagging or vomiting. 

October 2013: Back pain sets in...starts off feeling like when you sleep funny, except it doesn't go away. Try switching chairs at work, heating pads, visits to a chiropractor, accupuncturist, and physical therapist...nothing helps.

January 2014: Pain has spread from my back to my hip; I have to use a cane to get around.

February 2014: Following a visit to the clinic about my coughing fits/vomiting where the nurse practitioner decided to take a blood sample to test enzyme levels, I get a call advising me to go to an ER for X-rays/scans ASAP because of a liver enzyme level that was worrisomely high (could indicate bone disease). 

Go to the county hospital, they take an x-ray of my hip. They tell me there seems to be an abnormality present, then order an MRI of my hip, as well as a bone scan and CT scan of my torso. 

CT scan revealed an 8cm mass in my right lung, as well as lesions on my liver. Bone scan and MRI indicated additional tumors on my spine and hip. The doctors advised staying at the hospital for a biopsy.

March 2014: Biopsy results indicate stage IV lung cancer. Doctor recommends brain MRI, after which I learn the cancer has also spread to my brain. Am told it's incurable, and only palliative treatment can be given at this point. 



The pulmonologist who assured me I couldn't possibly have lung cancer is a very good friend and colleague of my uncle's; I'm reluctant to sue him because my aunt and uncle (both doctors) have been incredibly helpful since my diagnosis. They argued for radiation therapy on my spine when the hospital was unwilling to give it to me; if it weren't for their insistence, I'd probably still be in a wheelchair. I can walk without a cane right now, and I haven't needed my handicap parking placard for over six months. 

On the other hand, if the doctor had investigated the cancer possibility instead of pretty much shrugging it off, I'm almost certain we would have caught it before it was too late. The fact that my tumor wasn't visible on the x-ray implies that the cancer had not yet spread throughout my body (since the tumor was probably still too small to be visible). 

I'm not gonna lie, I could really use the money...there are so many things left on my bucket list (I really want to move out of LA...it may very well be what kills me, but I hate the thought of dying here), I don't know how much longer I'll be around, and unfortunately my limited financial resources make it very difficult to do anything. 

So what are your thoughts? Is it worth finding a medical malpractice lawyer and filing a lawsuit? Or should I spend whatever's left of my life trying to enjoy it, without worrying about spending time in court? Is maybe winning monetary damages from a lawsuit worth potentially upsetting my relatives?

‘DON’’T SAY THAT!”  Bart’s face blooming purple.

“What’s wrong?”

“Toilet paper reminds me of my gastrointestinal issues.”

“I didn’t mean…”

“No, of course not.  I didn’t say you MEANT anything.  You didn’t do anything wrong.  You understand that.  I’m not blaming you.  It’s just that…”

“Why do I feel I’ve committed a heinous crime.”

“Well you see it’s a bit complicated.  I’m trying to keep my mind off my butt.  Because if I think about my butt my butt says, ‘I gotta go.  Do as I say.  Presto!.’ ”

“Presto?  Let me guess.  Your butt is Italian.”
     
“Precisely.”

“So you’re in the thrall of the underground, the Tube. Anale Centrale.”

“Excellent.  There’s more, however.”

“Speak.”

“Nothing really.  It’s just that your saying we need more toilet paper implies I’m using more than my quota of toilet paper.”

“I must make a note of that.  Perfectly logical.”

“Glad you got it.”

Dark long haired man with 19th Century broad brimmed Italian hat and black cape enters shouting.

“My name is Giovanni and I’ve got cancer.  I’ve got cancer.”

Chorus of man and wife, “Giovanni!  You’ve come to the right place.  Have a seat.  We were just talking about adjusting to life with cancer.  

“Conquer it!..Think nothing but positive thoughts.  Eat right,” Giovanni roars. I sing in a traveling Opera troupe.  Tosca.  I will go on with my singing.  Until the day I die.  That is my destiny.”

“I was discussing toilet paper with my beloved,” said Bart, whose face has depurplefied.
“You’re talking about toilet paper while I have cancer?  Priorities, my friend.  Priorities,” intones Giovanni.

“One person’s tissues - not everyone’s issue,” Bess says didactically.  

“How well I remember playing Caravaggio in Tosca - Milano, 1903.  What a performance.  And now I have cancer.  What irony.!  What tragedy.!” Giovanni chants.  

“Caravaggio?  The painter?”  asks Bart.

“Who cares?  What are you, some kind of knit picker.  A painter is a painter.”  

A blond woman in pigtails dressed in the manner of the musical, Oklahoma, dances on stage.  “My oncologist is a jerk.  It’s a day after chemotherapy.  My blood pressure is seventy over forty.  He says chemotherapy doesn’t cause such massive drops in blood pressure.  He says it couldn’t be.”

“So what is he doing about your blood pressure?”  Bart asks.

“Nothing.  He says it couldn’t be due to chemotherapy.  I should go see a cardiologist.”  the Oklahoma dancer replies.

“Trivialities?” barks Giovanni.  If I didn’t have cancer I could’ve been Pavoratti.”

“That’s temporally implausible,” says Bart.  

“Are you saying I’m confused?   Are you implying I’m a nobody?  A person of no importance?  A speck in the universe?  I challenge you to a duel.  You are annihilating my sense of self.  You are offending my dignity.”

“I didn’t mean to decimate your decibels,’”  says Bart.  ",Old-and-grumpy,t3_32nff8,3,2015-04-15 04:35:12,9,32nff8

My boyfriend's mother was moved into Palliative Care. She's had very aggressive forms of cancer (I'm not sure which) with low survival rates. Mid-February, she was told that the chemo was not working anymore but that they felt she might have a few years. 

She's now in Palliative Care. I believe she has been there for about a week now.

Looking online, I see that Palliative Care isn't necessarily Hospice, although Hospice includes Palliative Care. I'm not sure if terminology is different either as I'm in America and they're in Australia, but was wondering if anyone knew what this might mean. 

She's having trouble reading, and isn't very comfortable (plus major fatigue as she's barely able to sleep). I asked my supervisor about bereavement leave (would only be given about 10 days including travel, which isn't ideal...) but I'm not sure if this would affect midterms or how I should proceed (I'm an adjunct). Boyfriend said he didn't see how she could make it to July, so I wasn't sure what this all meant.

Thanks for any information. ",BroodingWriter,t3_34ga91,15,2015-04-30 22:12:24,2,34ga91

I had the news from a very blunt oncologist, who used phrases like ""chock full of cancer,"" which has the effect of bringing to mind date-nut bread with cream cheese. She sayys it is in:
1) his colon/rectum
2) his liver; everywhere 
3) his thoracic  vertebra (one or two) 
4) a few lymph nodes 
5) and a membrane that I can't recall the name of (notes are not present).

She said his liver is currently too cancerous for full-on chemotherapy. That she's trying a small dose to shrink some of the tumors and drain his liver of bile. He's jaundiced now. If she can't do targeted chemo to some of the tumors on his liver and he goes into failure, it's months. She said he can eat what he wants. maybe a couple of years if he doesn't. God knows better.

I feel like I was so blind. Like I didn't see it, or I saw it and didn't want to see it. He lost weight. A lot of it. I was like, hey, your diet is finally working. He hid it. He was wearing diapers to keep us from knowing about the bowel issues. He started getting a little jaundiced and I told him he had a tan. Now his eyes are yellow. 

She said all care is palliative now. I believe that everyone has a time, and that's the only thing that gets you - but I feel so guilty and blind like an idiot. I know its eating him but he's the kind of guy who covers up a lot and puts on his brave face. He lost it once a month ago, when he told us it was cancer, and he cried and said he didn't want to die yet, he had so much left to do.

I have to take care of things, because nobody else can. My sister is not an adult in her mind whatsoever; we can't even trust her to turn off the lights or do her own dishes when she uses them. He's divorced, though my mother is helping out since she's a doctor and all that. 

I want to hear advice from others and suggestions. What should I be doing? I visit him every day and we chat, I try to keep him upbeat. But should we talk about the disease? Should we not? Should I let him determine that? I've never really been in a similar situation. I asked detailed questions to his oncologist... He's coming home Sunday, they said (currently inpatient so they can observe the effects of the chemo on his bilirubin and ast and so forth numbers). 

I'm sorry if this is kind of unorganized. I don't feel super miserable yet. Maybe I will later. I feel guilty, worried, but not grieving yet.

So I need to take a moment to breath, vent and just share with you a few updates - for anyone seeing this thread and not knowing the backstory feel free to browse through my past posts :)

I just saw my dad for Father's Day and it was really nice. Mum cooked a nice curry pie and I baked an apple crumble, there was presents and laughs. It was good, forgetting the cancer even though it lurked right there at the edge of this happy circle. It was what we all think will be his last Father's Day.

After having more pain and going in for tests a few weeks back we have found that since his consultation in Jan where he was told there were no signs of the secondaries and the primary had shrunk, him finishing chemo in Feb and his last scan the primary has exploded in size and his pressing on the exit to his stomach - hence the pain.

The secondaries are now also all over his stomach and growing in size and number ... the cancer is aggressive and active, and there is nothing more that can be done except palliative care and prayers ... lots and lots of prayers.

Prayers not for a miracle cause I think we're beyond that now, but prayers for compassion and that he doesn't suffer.

My mum today told me he's started saying odd stuff like that he feels I'm around the house all the time, that it feels like I'm just upstairs and I'll walk in any moment. Or he tell her not to shut the door because Kyle, our old german shepherd who we put to sleep a few years back, will be shut out. She's just waiting for him to start talking about my brother who passed away back in 2000.

Last week we buried his aunt who just passed away from cancer and earlier this year we buried her husband for the same reason.

He's on loads of meds and been referred to a team for his chest as he keeps getting infections and he's been referred to another team who deal with pain. And he has days where you wouldn't know anything was wrong and then other days where he's in quite a bit of pain.

The cancer nurse is bringing him papers to sort out a DNR and he's started talking about his funeral.

And next week ... next week I go round to my rents to help my mum change their rooms around, take their bed down and prep it for the arrival of the hospital bed on thursday. She's thinking of having the bathroom redone to put a shower in as he's starting to struggle with the bath.

So thats about it ... I think the end is coming and I think we all know this.

I've been his caregiver since April and I'm ready to give up.,"He went to the doctor in March thinking he was having a heart attack from pressure in his chest. He called me to tell me it wasn't good, something was in his chest but they couldn't tell what. I immediately flew 5000 kms home thinking it was his heart. The doctors didn't tell us anything just that he had some sort of lung cancer, sent him home and said someone would be calling him.   

I flew back to the city I was living in completely numb and lost. I read as much as I could online about lung cancer. I couldn't understand what was taking so long for him to see an oncologist and to start treatment or to even answer our questions. My aunt(from my moms side), was really helpful and took care of dad for me. He was scared to be alone in the house, and wanted someone with him for the appointments. After a few test and biopsies they told him he has extensive stage small cell lung cancer. It spread to his lymph nodes, kidneys and bones. My aunt told me he talked about wanting me home, needing me there, he wasn't doing good. They didn't think he would last until the end of the month (April). 

I packed everything up and flew home and left my husband to deal with the rest and drive across the country when he was ready. Dad started Chemo a couple of days after I got home. He does Chemo for 3 days, every 3 weeks. He has had 5 round of Chemo so far, his 6th round is July 27th and then they are stopping Chemo and starting radiation to his hip, chest and brain. 

They said he is responding well to  the treatment but he still only has weeks to months left. I love my dad very much but I've always only been able to handle so much of him at a time. I moved out of his house at 16, but we always kept in contact. I would call him weekly if I couldn't stop by and see him. 

I'm struggling everyday. It's very hard caring for someone who hasn't been taking care of himself for years. He's a heavy smoker, obviously, and drinks more than he should. It took my aunt, cousin and I almost two full months to clean and organize just the main floor of his house so that my husband and I could live here somewhat comfortably. I'm constantly picking up after him, inside the house and outside. I love him but I can only argue with him so much about how he should be caring for himself. It's seriously like I'm caring for a child. He's always had a bad temper and now I feel like I can't even get mad at him or talk back to him about any of it. 

I've never posted on here ever before so I doubt I'm even doing this right. I just don't know what to do anymore and it's only been since April. My grandmother passed of colon cancer in May, we just found out my grandfather has prostate cancer two weeks ago, and we put our family dog down last night. Things are just getting ridiculous now.

Dads wishes are to stay home and die at home, preferably outside in his back yard. I don't want to worry him or upset him but I can't deal with that. I can't give him that much care, I don't know what to expect or how to do any of it. He wont even listen to me about not mixing his medication with alcohol or to drink more water. He's stubborn and refuses to listen to anyone but I still love him so much and really wish he wasn't going through this. I'm drained and have no energy, depressed from everything that's going on but I don't want him knowing. The palliative care team changed his medication all around to help with his pain and energy. They have him on Ritalin to boost his energy which just drains me even more now. He's an extreme extrovert and I'm an extreme introvert. I don't know what to do so that I can change my mood and be able to deal with him better.  My husband has no idea how to be helping me either and this is the last place that he wants to be. 

What should I be expecting in the end? How can I help him? How can I convince him to take better care of himself. How much does palliative care do when someone wishes to stay home and die? What do I do now for myself to make it easier after his death in regards to his finances and funeral plans, house, car, everything else adult related that I have no clue what to do with.

Remission successful. So why 6 months later do I STILL feel horrible and exhausted?,"I have cll leukemia(also cerebral palsy that's mild but in the last decade or so has caused major chronic pain of it's own) and went through chemo with rituximab and Bendamustine . Achieved remission.  However:
1. The spleen pain that initially sent me to the er and got me diagnosed is STILL HERE. Dr says they don't know why it still hurts. But it's more pain than I can ignore at the least and me sweating,unable to be upright/focus/be touched or speak at its worst. Bad ""attacks"" of the pain a few times a month.  Luckily my awesome palliative care Dr has me on quick action pain meds for breakthrough pain and round the clock pain med otherwise. But why hasn't that gone away?
2. Kidney damage that requires me to take potassium 2 times a day or it drops to heart attack level in a day or two. Why didn't anyone warn me this might happen?
3.Major fatigue still. Can't be up and moving more than 10 minutes.  I'll end up hurting sweating and feeling like I'm gonna faint. Ok while laying on couch or in bed. Can go to visit friends if we just literally sit around but even 3 hours of that and im done physically. 
4. Taste and smell perversion like during chemo for no reason out of the blue 
5. My internal medicine Dr said that even with remission I have a chronic disease and as such my immune system is gonna always be weakened and my body reacts negatively to the small bit of cancer that is always there. Is that true in anyone's experience?
6. People have told me that the chemo was a major damage to my body along with having undiagnosed stage 2-3 cll leukemia for probably a few years. The chemo is literally poison and the leukemia stresses every part of the body because it's in the blood.  Could this account for all the stuff im still going through?
Just curious what fellow cancer patients have gone through and if they got all the way better. Also has your cancer experience left you with chronic pain? How common is this?",divapowers,t3_3esxrk,11,2015-07-27 18:53:28,16,3esxrk

I mean we have always talked about anything &amp; everything,  we are best friends,  we rarely talk of the end though. She's 34, I'm 45. Her wonderful husband says our visits are exactly what she needs...normal. Not pitying or crying. I asked my husband tonight how he stayed so strong when his Mom was dying (breast cancer)  &amp; he said he didn't know. He's pretty good at compartmentalizing his emotions,  I'm not; I wear my heart on my sleeve. 

I just need to put this down in writing as it really does help me control my grief as I get ready to go see her tonight. F*ck cancer. ",daelite,t3_3f375n,17,2015-07-29 22:37:27,9,3f375n

He's been confused, but has been able to talk and hold a conversation up until Saturday night. He is in a tremendous amount of pain, can't talk, and pain medication they have him on doesn't seem to be enough. Palliative care is double booked and they're trying to get him into there or hospice, but they're waiting for him to be in less pain because he won't have a sitter in hospice. That doesn't exactly make sense to me, because they said he'll be in less pain in palliative care!  Just don't know what to believe or think.

They believe it was from a tumor in her upper GI track. No treatment will be given for it unless she needs more blood. The doctors recommended hospice, she declined. She's not ready for it she says, but they are trying to get home nurse visits started again. 

The cancer in her bones hurts like crazy,  she can barely walk &amp; not unassisted. I rubbed her shoulders/ back for her &amp; she told me the lymph node that the chemo helped shrink was very swollen again. It made me realize, in regards to the prognosis 4 months - a year, that the 4 months mark is coming upon us Oct 5th. We're running out of time. They've not found anyone else willing to treat her. No clinical trials, no chemo, just palliative care. There is still much she wants to enjoy &amp; is fighting so hard to keep what health she has. She wants to see her son graduate so badly,  she cries when she talks about not seeing him marry his girlfriend.  She &amp; her son are staying worth her adoptive patents (my aunt &amp; uncle) so she's never alone; she gets care from 5 wonderful people who have loved her as their own her entire life.  I'm so grateful she's not alone while her husband has to work,  I just wish I could be with her more than a couple hours a week. It's heartbreaking,  she &amp; I used to be inseparable. I don't know what I'll do when she's gone.

She is constantly in my thoughts, not an hour goes by without me thinking of her, praying for a miracle, hoping for healing/cure. This cancer has been so aggressive, it's spread from her cervix, to her pelvic wall,  kidneys, liver,  stomach, colon, rectum, spine, &amp; femurs with no signs of slowing down. When she was in the hospital we had the talk I knew we both needed to have, the one she admitted how afraid she was of leaving her husband &amp; son, of leaving me.  She is religious, she knows she will finally be with our Mom &amp; our sister again when she dies but leaving those living is what keeps her praying for more time. My heart is broken &amp; being strong all the time is so hard...but I feel it's my duty to her to keep going,  to actually live a full life when all I want to do is crawl in bed with my blankets &amp; cry my heart out for her &amp; our family. 

Sorry for the ramble, just need to get this out of my heart for a few minutes.  Fuck you cancer, I hate you.",daelite,t3_3mvfim,2,2015-09-29 19:40:57,11,3mvfim

Sister 35 Small Cell Cervical Cancer.,"I've posted many times since we got the news about my 35 year old sister last December when she was diagnosed with stage 2b Cervical Cancer, the upgraded to stage 4b in June when they told us it was small cell cancer and there was no further treatments they could give to help slow the cancer down. She was doing well until Friday night, she was even able to get up on her own from her wheelchair to use the facilities at her son's Senior Night football game. Saturday, however she started to decline even further. She slept from Saturday afternoon until Tuesday when her husband took over decision making about her health. She was adamant that she did NOT need hospice care (she really did though), my BIL called them in. They got her a hospital bed within 2 hours and got her set up, it took 4 people to move her because she is so weak. She was awake Tuesday night for a bit, but confused (may say things non related to what we were talking about or my just blurt out something odd), and her breathing is labored...I know what these are signs of, I know we don't have a lot of time left...it's time to say that last goodbye. Last evening she never woke, nor could they rouse her to say goodbye to an Aunt and Uncle who had come to visit. The one ""good"" thing about her sleeping so much, she doesn't seem to be in any pain, her suffering has been heartbreaking when she was always so healthy and strong until December '14. I pray that she goes peacefully when she is ready to let go, I never wanted to see my second younger sister pass. We were supposed to grow old together and be grannys together watching our grandchildren play, she was supposed to see her only child graduate high school next May, she was supposed to spend many years with my dear brother in law. She told me Sunday when her Dad (my uncle who adopted her when our Mom passed) was getting her dinner...she was supposed to be taking care of Mom and Pop...not the other way around (she is very upset about this).

We had 2 nurses come in yesterday, they hospice nurse says maybe a month. A palliative care nurse friend says maybe 2-3 weeks. I hope our oldest sister can get home to say her last goodbye before she passes. Her husband's birthday is Sunday, so praying she makes that. Her favorite holiday is Halloween, so I think that when the veil is thin she may let go then...it would be ironic (I'm not intending to be morbid...she absolutely loves All Hallows Eve.) When her time does come, she has our birth Mother, the sister who was between she and I and her birth Father waiting for her...I hope this can give her comfort and solace as she leaves those whom she loves in this lifetime. Her pastor/boss/friend is going to see her this morning, I hope she wakes to receive communion one last time today &amp; her nurse friend is coming to spend the day with her &amp; her husband has taken off work for the foreseeable future to be with her as well. (She's staying at her parents so that she had people near her 24/7 for the past few months.) I never imagined that we'd only get 5 months from when they told us she was terminal back in June, I guess that was my denial. I celebrated when we past the four month mark and she was doing as well as she was. I was hoping to make it thru the holiday...for more memories for all of us. 

EDIT: My older sister did make it home for the weekend to see our little sister and to say goodbye. She went home last night and our little sister passed this morning in her husband's arms. I can't think of anything more peaceful than that. 

**Remembered Joy**

*Don’t grieve for me, for now I’m free!
I follow the plan God laid for me.
I saw His face, I heard His call,
I took His hand and left it all…
I could not stay another day,
To love, to laugh, to work or play;
Tasks left undone must stay that way.
And if my parting has left a void,
Then fill it with remembered joy.
A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss…
Ah yes, these things I, too, shall miss.
My life’s been full, I’ve savored much:
Good times, good friends, a loved-one’s touch.
Perhaps my time seemed all too brief –
Don’t shorten yours with undue grief.
Be not burdened with tears of sorrow,
Enjoy the sunshine of the morrow.*",daelite,t3_3prt6t,9,2015-10-22 13:43:17,22,3prt6t

To start off with, my grandpa isn't the grandpa that lives 2000 miles away and I see him once a year at Christmas. I've lived with him since the day I was born. Hes pretty much my second father. 

About a year ago, he was diagnosed with melanoma on his neck. His mole that he's had his entire life turned cancerous and he had to get it removed. No big deal, he got it scraped off and we thought that was that. They did test and saw that the cancer spread deeper in his neck into his lymph nodes. So he undergoes a surgery to remove that lymph node, and a lot of the surrounding tissue. He lost sensation in part of his face and ear because of this. 

Fast forward 9 months from then, he had just finished his radiation and was considered cancer free. They did some type of scan not including his head(this is important) and didn't see anything In his lower body so they deemed him cancer free. 2 months later he gets shingles, and is put onto Hydrocodone for the pain. This ends up not sitting well for him and he's constipated for about a week until the pain is so bad he had to go to the hospital. Well there, they saw his left side was incredibly weak. They thought he was undergoing a stroke so they did a mri?(I'm awful with what scans are for what) and saw that he had a fairly sized tumor in his head. They scanned his lower body and also found cancer in his liver and lungs. They said the tumor in the brain was there before the tumors in the body, which is really, really rare. Basically his life would have been saved if they did a full body scan and didn't exclude his head. 

Luckily, the tumors are located in a spot where they can easily operate in the brain. So he undergoes a surgery to remove the tumors and it goes wonderful, no issues at all and they remove all the tumors, they didn't leave any behind. But now this is where it all goes down hill. He's making his recovery from the surgery, he regains strength in his left side, is moving it around, he's able to have coherent conversations. Then boom, four days after his surgery and his great recovery he isn't responding at all, and his body was starting to shut down. They do a second scan and see he has bleeding in his brain due to being on blood thinners. So they go in and release pressure, and it's been a steady increase in brain activity every since the operation. 

What I didn't know is in May, after he found out cancer got to his lymph nodes, he got a DNR. I don't know if he was depressed, or what, but basically he wrote out a living will saying that if he is to under go something similar to what is going on right now, he only wants pain meds and any other meds that will make him comfortable. So we've pretty much stopped all treatment, he's not even hooked up to a heart rate monitor. 

I have to slowly watch my grandfather starve to death because of this shit illness. The one plus side is he isn't in any pain and is pretty comfortable. It's just so sad to see him going through all of this. He's a man who went through open heart surgery with a slim survival rate and made it out. Doctors were actually shocked he survived it. He's always been a fighter, and it sucks to see us have to give up. This is the man that I've looked up to all my life. 

The only way they will start treatment is if his brain activity goes up to the point where he can walk around and talk coherently, which doesn't look like it's going to happen. I've never experienced death of someone I'm really close to, so this is all kind of new to me. I just figured you'd all understand what it's like to either go through this yourself, or Have to watch a loved one go through it. Thank you for those of you who took the time to read my lackluster, and probably incoherent venting. To anyone else going through this, I wish you the best, because this honestly fucking sucks. 

Edit: 2 days later, we have him home and on hospice care. He passed 5 hours after we had him home.",Varrianda,t3_3smxhp,8,2015-11-13 06:57:17,11,3smxhp

My mom(55) was diagnosed a little while ago with stage IV esophageal cancer and is on palliative care. I'm a pretty logical person and i've looked up the stats on esophageal cancer and everything on palliative care and it's pretty much there that she won't make it. The doctors told me that palliative chemotherapy simply acts to prolong life and all the stats i've found online say that there's a pretty high chance of the palliative chemotherapy not working and her dieing within a year and if it does work she'll die within 5. Thing is that i'm currently in college and the only person I really care about is my mom. She's my best friend.

It was deemed inoperable as it had already spread to his liver, so he's been having palliative chemo since then.

Every time I see pancreatic cancer mentioned, people say how it's one of the worse ones. That people are pretty well (like my Dad is now), and then things go downhill fast. It's so, so scary to know that. I know my Dad is going to die from this, but I don't know when that will be. I feel like I have no warning. How am I supposed to cope with this? 

I'm in my early 20's, I'm not ready for him to go yet. Or to see my Mum lose her partner of so many years. Or to spend what will probably be our last Christmas together.

My dad was supposed to start adjuvant chemo a couple months after surgery (ended up being in September, changed surgeons), but he had some problems after surgery and was asked to follow up in November. When that week in November came, my dad came down with a bad fever as a result of a kidney infection and then peritonitis.

By the time he left the hospital (he was in for 13 days, and that was about 2 weeks ago), his kidney levels were normal, but his bloodwork shows it's gotten worse again. His oncologist is setting up a meeting with other oncologists as well as his surgeon to see if it's safe for him to have chemo, considering his bowel wall is still healing both from resection and the rupture and his serum creatinine levels (I think that's what it's called? In his last bloodwork, I'm told it was 195) are elevated again. 

Without adjuvant chemo, there's a 30% risk of recurrence... but considering the hell he went through post-surgery, quite honestly the worst I have ever seen him, the last thing I want to do is compromise his health and healing. At the same time, the back of my mind is saying to me ""do you want to wait and see, and then have him end up on palliative chemo someday soon?""

They'll be meeting with the oncologist again next Tuesday. As far as I know, adjuvant chemo is just par for the course for colorectal. I've asked my parents to ask the oncologist if it's possible or worthwhile to do things a bit out of order, like stoma takedown surgery in 12 weeks (when the surgeon said it would be appropriate, and the thing my parents are looking forward to) and then do chemo after his recovery from that... maybe in 5-6 months?

**Has anyone else postponed their adjuvant chemo, or forgone it altogether? If so, did your oncologist think it would have a big impact on your overall prognosis?**",theRacistEuphemism,t3_3v7lsl,4,2015-12-02 23:36:10,2,3v7lsl

I'm new to this site but wanted to see if there was a way I can find out what others have been through and how to best deal with it.

In June this year my wife and I were informed that she had cancer of the bowel and also extensive shadows on her liver but would know more after a colonoscopy. This followed and results confirmed that she had metastatic colorectal cancer (stage 4). The news was like a bomb had gone off - absolutely devastated to say the least.

The doctor asked if we had suspected this news. Why on earth would we suspect that? I mean, my wife had been violently sick (wretching for weeks and losing weight) but just put it down to a bad virus or something. Reading up on it now, symptoms arise when its at the advanced stage.

I spoke to oncologist on my own as my wife didnt want to know too much. He said that due to the extent of cancer on her liver (in 6 places and covering half of her liver) it cant be operated on at all due to there not being enough healthy liver left to rebuild itself and where the tumours are on the liver. The only route we can go down is palliative and involved chemotherapy. I also asked the prognosis and informed me it was likely to be 18-24 months due to the metastasis of the liver. A life I can't comprehend bringing up my two children without their mother who is only in her early 30's. To make it worse I was also told that our two young children would likely to have 'the gene' also but tried to put my mind at ease by saying they would bring them forward for tests for cervical, prostate etc at the earliest opportunity. So ive got it all to go through again later on.

I have tried to discuss things with her but think she thinks im just being negative and all her friends are saying she can beat this and she is a fighter and everything will be okay. Just feels like I cant win. Im really struggling to accept any of this and just want to crawl in a hole away from everyone and everything. Something I know I can't do as I work full time and have two young children. I love her so much and feel so, so helpless that I cant do anything to rid her of this retchid disease. I'm her husband and is my job to protect her and I can't even do that.

I've even visited Macmillan and briefly spoken to them but just can't open up properly with them. They did offer to meet up with families in similar circumstances but I just don't want to and in fact, can't.  I just can't. 

She has now finished 5 months of chemotherapy (Folfiri) and to start with she had very minor side effects apart from mouth ulcers, odd sickness feeling in morning and lots of tiredness the few days after chemo session. She thought chemo was a breeze but is now finding it harder and harder. She is full of the cold at the moment which has caused her to miss a couple of chemo sessions and is really suffering from fatique at the moment and not eating anywhere near as much as she normally does. Having said that she is still drinking fizzy energy drinks / pop, sweets, chocolate and cakes. Cant really take them away from her as what else would she have? Everything else has been taken away from her. I know...I have heard all about the sugar feeds cancer stories but what can I do?

She's had a ct scan in september and was told that there was partial response and nothing showing in the bowel area and some shrinkage in the liver tumours. She said she planned to celebrate with her friends and later accused me of not being happy about the news. I was happy that it has shrunk the tumour a bit but the fact is, she stll has metastatic colorectal cancer and it can't be cured - our oncologist has twice told me this now. It's almost like shes been told she is cured and the cancer has completely gone. I have to try and stay focused and keep some realism to the situation as I know cancer can do so much damage and change very quickly. Does that make me a bad person?

Can the cancer go from partial response to start growing again through next phase of chemo? Is it still too early to tell if everything is going to plan? She has recently had pain in her hip and liver pains have resurfaced again occasionally. Is this a bad thing?

Has anyone else been in similar situation or any advice which would be greatly appreciated. Thankyou and sorry for going on a bit. Just feel a bit lost at the moment :-(",robwatto80,t3_3vgcwd,13,2015-12-04 19:48:18,5,3vgcwd

My father a Vietnam Veteran was diagnosed April 20 2015 with stage 4 small cell lung cancer. He had chemotherapy till October of 2015. 

 We lost my mother in law 2 years ago to the same disease. We are aware of how fast this disease takes its toll on a person. 

My current situation:
I am in Vermont. He decided in November to head to Florida to avoid the cold weather and the sicknesses it brings with it. 

He went to the doctors last Friday and I received a call on Saturday from a radiologist stating he only had about 2-3 months based on his scan results and that was with radiation. Another call followed on Sunday with an oncologist stating based on his opinion it was more like a month to 6 weeks. Yet another call on Monday  from another palliative doctor stating he thought it would be less than a week. 

I spoke with the hospice center he was moved to and they said he was at the end of his life but they thought it was more than a week.

What I know:
His tumor has grown to the size it was taking over one lung and pushing on the aorta. The cancer has spread to his liver and his brain. 

My dilemma :
He wants me to fly down to Florida and drive him back here. Based on the information I have none of it sounds like a good idea to me but I don't want to ignore his wishes. Has anyone ever been in the same situation?",Blazer73,t3_42b54d,6,2016-01-23 15:03:56,2,42b54d

Plane tickets alone can cost $1200, and then there's renting a car and somewhere to stay, food, etc.  Too much, for a student.

Last summer, I got the call from him to say that he had been diagnosed with small cell lung cancer.  It's been a struggle since, and he went through chemo over last fall.  I worked two jobs last fall so that I could afford the trip to see him at Christmas, which would likely be his final one.

Two weeks ago, I was speaking with his doctor who told me that the time left would be counted as weeks.  I began preparations to bring him to my province, but was hit with a few roadblocks and delays that now turn out to be not necessary.

Hope Air - you guys rock.  You paid for the flight to bring my dad right to my little local airport, not the big major one 3 hours away.

He got in tonight just after midnight, and I was able to take him directly to the palliative care unit.  They'd kept an extra staff member on just to do his check in at such a late hour, and they even brought him some juice and a fresh sandwich.  The room he's in is private, and it's nicer than some places I've lived.

Now, for whatever time he has left, I can spend it with him and see him more often.  Our visits have often had 3 - 4 years between them due to the costs, but this will be very nice.  And even better?  I'm playing in a game this weekend with the roller derby team that I've been a part of for the last 3 years.  He's never had the chance to see me play, and he really wants to go.

It was deemed inoperable and she received palliative chemo and radiation therapy. She's in relatively good health still, but is simply waiting for it to go south.

She has been understandably very depressed, but recently she's showing signs of severe depression. She constantly talks about death, the mistakes she made in life, how horrible her father's cancer was, contemplating the ways she'll end her life when the cancer worsens. She's lashing out at my sister and dad, who live with her and who are in denial that her cancer is terminal. It's very worrying.

She's receiving care at one of the best cancer treatment clinics in the state. They have incredible mental health resources including free individual and group therapy sessions with counselors specifically trained to help terminal cancer patients. I keep gently pushing her to take advantage of these services, but my mom absolutely refuses to talk to anyone.

Her excuses are ""what the hell would a 20-something fresh out of college know about death?"" and ""What's the point? I'm going to die soon anyway."" She's been saying this type of thing for 18 months. Ironically, before the cancer she saw a therapist for depression for years and has, or had, faith in the effectiveness of counselling. She also takes antidepressants.

I can't force her to go to a therapist and she is ignoring my pleas and those of my sister and dad. I live in another state and make regular visits. Every time i come down she's in a worse state. I don't know what to do or say that could make her feel better, or at least seek out professional help.

Meanwhile she's spiralling downward, refusing to leave the house and spending the last good months (years?) of her life in misery.

What can I do, if anything?

I'm not an emotional person by nature (I didn't cry when I watched Up, or Finding Nemo, or Inside Out; I know I'm a monster) but we weren't given any instruction on how to help patients or really interact with patients. Even worse, I guess there wasn't anything on how the patients would affect us.

I remember one of my first patients was so happy to finish therapy that she practically jumped off the bed after her last treatment and cried when she rung the bell; I think I almost teared up also and she gave me a hug even though I saw her once. Then I had two palliative patients. One had bone mets from her knees up, and she had help from her husband to get her on and off the treatment couch and would wince because the mets were osteolytic.

My fathers health has deteriorated at a rapid pace in the last month, and here I find myself in a hospice, witnessing every detail of his palliative care and asking myself what the fuck is going on?
The man I knew has gone and in his place a poisoned skeleton, only his eyes remain the same, but now fear and pain oozes from his tears. His independents has been robbed from him. The tables have turned, for 21 years this man has cared for in every way I know a parent can, all physically, emotionally, mentally and financially. He was my go-to man, he knows all the answers. Now I'm feeding him baby sized pieces of fruit and helping him move inches in his bed. I dash out the room when the nurses come to uncover his dignity, I hear him screaming in pain. 
 
My only previous knowledge of hospices was that I'd picked up in films, and we all know, people come here to die. Something I struggle with walking to and from the day room to get my cuppa and sneak someone else's soya milk in my tea. 
The nurses are so wonderful, I showered earlier and nearly forgot where I was. 
I'll be spending all the remaining time my dad has in this world in this reclining chair i sit on now, tending to his every need. 

I've never lost anyone in my family, let alone my hero and I'm shit scared, I feel really alone and cant even comprehend this feeling.

She will be living with us during palliative care. We are lucky enough to be able to get professional care to come frequently. Top of the line hospital bed.

We have cards and board games. Depending on her energy levels we will be trying to roll her outside and just enjoy each other's company.

My parents have been together for 45 years, since they were 19 years old. My poor dad has been crying so much. He admitted to me that he's having suicidal thoughts, and he's asking for help. I've never seen him like this. He doesn't have the greatest support system. He has friends who are coworkers, but they're not like bosom buddies. His parents are long gone, and his sisters are scattered across the country. My brother's a mess in his own right. I'm not going to say I'm a beacon of sanity, but I'd say I have it the most together of anyone at this moment. 

The hospital social worker and the palliative care people are great for my mom's needs but inadequate for my dad's. Support groups once a month? A referral to a grief counselor? I firmly believe (and my father agrees) that he needs daily psychiatric care for the foreseeable future. 

He is waking up at night and having panic attacks, thinking of my mom no longer being beside him. He is still going to work half-time, which is good, but at night we've both been unable to sleep and he just sits on the couch motionless and afraid. I don't want to hospitalize him; that would rob him of some of the time he has left to be with my mom.

We're in the St. Louis area. Please respond or PM me with any leads on daily grief counseling or crisis care that WON'T lead to an involuntary hospitalization.

My father is fighting a Stage 4 cancer (likely gastric, but we're still waiting on PET scan results). It's spread to his liver, stomach, esophagus, lungs, and brain. This makes is prognosis pretty bad, and combined with some other health problems (COPD and Diabetes), he likely doesn't have a lot of time left.

He recently underwent SRS for his brain tumor, which has improved his quality of life quite a bit. This is where things get tricky. Most of the family is looking at this as my dad ""turning the corner"" and is now very excited about him getting ""cured"". In reality, this is more of a palliative treatment to help make his last year or so more comfortable.

I'm really trying to get family members to come and visit, because what my father really wants is quality time with them. However, most of them are convinced he's going to be cured and want to wait until he gets better to visit. 

I have no problem with hope and optimism, but right now what my dad really needs is his family. I know their hearts are in the right place; they want to let him rest because they see that he is exhausted and not feeling well. 

Has anybody else run into this? My father and I understand what this prognosis means, but we're really having a hard time making it clear to people who don't see us every day.

Right around the time we found out he had cancer (and still during our hopeful times), I had to move overseas for a new career path. I could've stayed, but I went anyway because he was so proud. The day I left I hugged him. He was going to get better, right? But he didn't.

Last friday my mother called me, he was not well. I hopped on a plane the next day. When I saw him... he was so thin, he couldn't walk or talk anymore. But he recognized me and smiled when he saw me and touched my face.

I thought I was coping well. I was so calm, so peaceful, so accepting. He lived a great life and I always told him I love him. My ""circle"" with him is closed, nothing left to say. I felt at peace.

Today the doctors said he has an infection in his lungs that is not responding to antibiotics, and he also has kidney failure. He can die at any moment now.

We just got a call from the hospital, they wanted us at home to know that the had moved him to a different room. But those seconds between they said ""the hospital"" and started talking about the room, I felt my heart sink. I was shaking.

I am looking for some help and advice. My mother, who is 67, lives in Ireland and was diagnosed with kidney cancer in the summer with secondaries on the pelvic bone. This was only discovered after a scan which followed a cardiac arrest in the spring - her illness came out of the blue for everyone. Since then, she has quickly deteriorated. Not so much physically - although she has lost weight and suffers from a lot of pain - but mentally she is confused, irrational, aggressive and withdrawn.

She is on morphine to manage the pain from calcaemia, but she is also drinking a lot. We are all aware of the dangers of drinking in her condition - least of all combining it with morphine.

She will think nothing of screaming at my dad in a place if he refuses to buy wine. She says vile and nasty things to him - almost on a daily basis, and randomly flips at him. 

She has little appetite and what she does eat is mainly sweet things like pudding - and of course a few bottles of wine. She is tiny, 45kg was her last weight, she was probably nearly double this ten years ago.

My dad is on his own with her in Ireland - me and my other siblings live away and can only manage the odd trip every few weeks. This is a massive burden to my Dad and he is struggling to cope. Our experience of the health service in Ireland is not great - not a criticism of the doctors and nurses, just the system is terrible - lots of appointments have been misbooked or unnecessary (nearest hospitals are one hour and three and a half hours away so this is a big journey for someone in her condition.)

She has refused all treatment, so all she is receiving is palliative care.

We are resigned to her dying, but the way she is going is painful, very stressful and very upsetting. We are feeling a lot of guilt for not being there enough and my Dad is feeling helpless and hopeless and completely on his own.

I am wondering if anyone knows of any help or support my parents can recieve in this situation to deal with her mental incapacity, aggression and my dad's role as sole carer?

Thanks in advance.

She's been diagnosed with stage 4 DLBCL Lymphoma and her blood pressure went very very low. A bunch of doctors came and gave her IV fluids and meds to take the blood pressure up to a level where it was still low but not directly life threatening. This was most likely due to internal bleeding because of a surgery she had 2 days ago, or because of an infection as the doctor said. A few hours after that a doctor came from the ""palliative"" care team. I was shocked when he introduced himself because I knew that palliative care is mostly only brought up for people that are relatively close to their death. This was very scary yet confusing for me because the cancer that my mother has is very curable and has cure rates of up to 70%, even at the later stages. So when the doctor came and asked us questions regarding quality or quantity of life and brought up life support machines, I just got very frightened. Could the team just be unaware that my mom has a good chance of getting cured? We talked to her oncologist and she said that my mother will be fine and she is already on the road to a cure, but I am just confused at why the palliative care team would come. Sorry if this is a stupid question, it was just a really shocking and emotional moment for me at the time, but why do you guys think the palliative care team became involved in my mothers case?

My mom passed away yesterday 24th of December 2016 at 8:20 pm in my arms, with the last deep breath she had in her. 

She was diagnosed only a couple weeks ago with non-small cell colon cancer and it was already Metastised to the right lung. 2 days ago they wanted to start with chemotherapy, but overnight her physical health decreased dramatically and was sent from the onkology station to the intensive care unit. 

After we talked to the doctor and he was not very hopeful, after this decrease of her health, my mom decided that she wants to go to the palliative care. From there on she got high ammounts of morphine and was from there on, barely able to talk, or to open her eyes. 

It was heartbreaking to experience the transition from life to her passing! Last week she was still walking around with a mobile oxygen machine at my home and was decorating the christmas tree with my wife and kid. - I just can't believe what just happend.....unreal :.(

2014 was a shitty year. My Dad had prostate cancer a decade ago, was in remission. I was 14 when he was first diagnosed, and things turned out fine, so I hardly thought about the fact that my Dad had cancer. 

Then early 2014 it came back, with a 10 month diagnosis to live. The fall and winter sucked seeing him deteriorate and go into palliative care. He passed in Feb 2015.

Then just before Christmas, my Mom got a breast cancer diagnosis. My understanding is it was caught earlier, and signs are looking positive for her. She started chemo Friday, and Tuesday had to go to emergency due to a bad reaction to chemo. She stayed that night and tonight in the hospital, I'm just hoping she's better and gets to go home tomorrow. 

All I've heard is that her cancer has a positive diagnosis, unlike my Dad's recent one. But it's just so hard seeing her drugged out on morphine, laying Ina hospital bed, bringing back memories of my Dad dieing in palliative care. 

I almost don't want to go see her, because I've had enough of hospitals and seeing parents weak and dieing in a god damn fucking hospital bed. But I have to see her, to keep her strong and to avoid any regrets.

Is there anything that can make this easier? All I can think is that I'm now losing my Mom too. At 26 this is bullshit, I want to have kids and have grandparents in their lives and now that probably won't happen",skyedemon,,3,2017-01-05 03:10:38,11,5m3vkh

The worst part is, I don't even remember what my last words to her were that she understood. When she opens her eyes, I'm not sure she can understand the things I'm saying to her.

Though I've made an effort in recent times to come around and see her more (prior to the diagnosis), I still am left feeling like I should have spent more time with her, done more things. I assume that everyone feels this regardless of how much time they spent.

Then I think to my childhood, about the horrible things I've done in my youth; how it all seems so petty and stupid.

It has been a hell of a journey to get here.,"**Fair warning, this might be a long post, but I have tried to make sure it is well written.**

 This is my story of chemo resistant lymphoma. I am a 25 yr old male in Canada and I just need to vent.

So far I have had 8 lumbar punctures, 5 bone marrow biopsies, 5 pet scans, many more xrays and CT scans, and a near death neutropenic infection. I am now in the hospital beginning my transplant.

I was diagnosed in Sept, 2016 with T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (a lymphoma that they treat like leukemia). It presented as a large mediastinal mass (10cm), I noticed symptoms such as shortness of breath and discomfort.

The first induction was the AL-4 regimen, A cocktail of drugs such as hd methotrexate, L-asparaginase, doxorubicin &amp; prednisone. The treatment took a month long hospital stay and had high chance of success. Initially we thought I had a complete remission, 80% shrinkage, so I went on to phase 2 of prophylactic cns treatment (lumbar puncture chemo)

after 3 weeks of being out I had a PET scan, which showed the residual mass was active.  So I went back in for another induction round.  This time it was high dose cytarabine and etoposide.  They told me it had a 50-60% success rate and I would surely need a stem cell transplant after.

The cytarabine caused a chemical burn on my face, similar to a bad sunburn and then  I had a neutropenic infection.  All I remember is being moved to the ICU and then waking up. I spent 10 days asleep under anesthetic, it took time to hear bits and pieces of what happened to me when I was under.

I had bacterial infection that lead to blood sepsis.  My heart was beating near 200 when they had to put me to sleep. Every day something presented a new challenge, I was not getting enough oxygen, my kidneys were failing, and they were scared my heart would give out. Waking up was terrible, I felt nauseous for nearly 2 weeks, and my muscles were now too weak to stand or walk.

I had to have a portable toilet next to my bed, and a strong nurse had to lift me and sit me on it for the first few days.  Slowly I began to use a stroller and begin my rehab. it took a few weeks to get walking again with the main setback of knee pain.

On top of all this, at the same time I was told that the 2nd chemo did not work, and that I had refractory disease.  They did not think I was strong enough to do another strong chemo so soon, and told me I had 10% chance of surviving another chemo, and that I should consider palliative care.

Finally, after consulting the regional specialist, they gave me nelarabine. It is an expensive chemo drug not often prescribed that was not covered by government insurance, but the hospital still paid for it.  It had shown 30% remission in refractory disease in a study, and was my best chance.  This treatment cost $80 000 for 4 cycles. Amazingly, it worked. That is why we continued the nelarabine until now, to get me to my stem cell transplant.  

I finally had my first inactive PET scan, just a week before the transplant. There was some activity after 2 cycles of nelarabine, but the next 2 seem to have finished the job.

Here I am today, my third time in the hospital for a stay expected to be longer than a month since September.  I am having an UCT from an unrelated donor, and we are doing a trial of ex-vivo expansion of the stem cells because I am rather large for cord blood.

There are a lot of risks with a procedure like this, but I feel that I have fought so hard and come so far since a few months ago that I can take anything on.  My main fear is another bad infection, but my doctor told me what I had was pretty bad and not so common.  It was one of the worst infections they have seen someone survive. 

If you made it to the end of this, words of encouragement or personal stories would be appreciated!

Wish me luck!

I am in such dire need for advice, and I'm not sure who to turn to. Last year, my fiancee was diagnosed with stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer at the age of 28. We went through the whole treatment plan (chemotherapy, single side mastectomy, and radiation), and our scan last October showed no signs of the disease and were told she was cured. Of course we were absolutely ecstatic, but our time of peace only lasted a mere 4 months. She had a seizure in late January of this year, and this led us to finding out that the cancer had metastasized to her brain, kidney, adrenal gland, and both lungs. We were terrified, but hey, at least it's treatable and we could have some time together still (the doctor estimated about 5 years).

So we started chemotherapy (ixabepilone) and were hoping that everything was going well. But in late February she started complaining of severe discomfort in her back (consistently rating her pain level at a 7 or 8) so we made a visit to the emergency room, which ended up with us being admitted for 5 days: the chemotherapy wasn't working. In that time we learned that her cancer had spread to her other kidney and adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas. She also had another seizure which led us to finding six small tumors in her brain.

Currently she's going through whole brain radiation treatment and we plan to start another type of chemo soon. 

She's my best friend and soul mate. We've been together for 3 and a half years and engaged for 3. Before being sent home by the palliative care team (which did get her pain under control with long acting morphine) we decided to get married in the hospital, officiated by the hospital chaplain.

I'm so thankful that we still have treatment options, but I am so so so worried that this next chemo won't work. I feel like I'm losing her so fast. How the fuck am I supposed to say goodbye to my best friend? She is a glass half full type, and has hope that this treatment will work and that an immunotherapy we're scheduled for (PD-1 inhibitor) will yield good results. I suspect that she's also putting on a brave face for me. 

I feel like I'm walking a fine line between sharing and reinforcing her confidence and steeling myself for the inevitable. I am so not ready to say goodbye to the love of my life, and I know I never will be. She is so goddamn young, all the plans we had for our lives have been crushed within a few months.

I feel so helpless. Does anyone have any advice or insight? ",-El-Zilcho-,,9,2017-03-21 19:50:52,15,60puze

Since then we are no further forward. We have no formal diagnosis. We have no treatment.

Here's the full story.

My Dad has COPD. Years of working on a building site and being a heavy smoker have fucked his lungs. His lung capacity is at about 25%-30%.

A few years ago he was given an operation to put valves in one of his lungs through in Glasgow. This was a successful operation and resulted in an improvement.

Since the end of last year he has been getting progressively worse with a series of chest infections that have left him really struggling for breath. In January he had a bad turn and was taken into hospital. He was very close to dying.

He was given an X-Ray which detected a shadow on his lung. He was then given a CT Scan a few weeks later. He and my mum attended the appointment for the results and this is where we were under the impression that he had lung cancer.

Now, here's where it gets hazy. The conversation my Dad had with the doctor was along the lines of my Dad asking ""is it cancer?"" and I believe the doctor said he 'thought' so. My Dad then said that he wasn't going to get to see his grandchildren grow up, and the Doctor patted his arm.

Both he and my mum can't remember the full conversation with the doctor as they were both understandably upset.

But here's the thing. This tumour, or mass, hasn't been biopsied. Because of my Dad's COPD they won't risk giving him an anaesthetic and putting him under. They tried to biopsy it with the tube down the throat but because of my Dad's breathing they weren't able to do so.

His Doctor said they were going to have a meeting to discuss his case last Thursday and they would phone him ASAP. They didn't. They eventually phoned on Monday after the Doctor said he'd forgot and that he'd been busy with work. The Doctor says there is no treatment they can give my Dad as he doesn't believe my Dad's lungs can cope with it, and began talking about palliative care.

So we're sitting with my Dad getting progressively more and more depressed because he's got this thing inside him, and we don't know whether it's a tumour or not (he has not had a formal diagnosis), whether it's benign, malignant, whether it's small cell, non-small cell, whether it's spreading, whether it's staying the same size, whether he has a few months, six months, a year, two years, five years, we have no idea.

His Doctor seems to have given up on him. My mum has e-mailed the surgeon who gave my dad the operation a few years ago as he's not scared of operating on people with poor lungs.

We just feel so lost. Has anyone been through anything similar? What are our next steps? We are in Scotland.",Gazcobain,,9,2017-04-28 17:06:33,12,683y3j

I know no one on here has a crystal ball, but I'd be interested in hearing about how fast things move along and what end of life looks like - specifically for leukemia patients, if possible.
Since his terminal diagnosis, I've become obsessed with time. I know many of you will tell me to just ""live in the moment"" but I'm finding it so hard. There's so much going on with people wanting to visit, me needing to step away for ""self care"" breaks from the toils of caretaking, and also potentially needing to return to work (if he'll live for months, I probably should work. But if it's going to be days/weeks, I want to spend every moment with him... that kind of thing). Sometimes he seems ok and I convince myself we have more time left (months maybe?) sometimes, he seems awful and I think death is days or a couple weeks - max - away. 
Yesterday I was reading an article online that lists signs that death may be near, many of which he has: difficulty swallowing, swollen feet, deep and lengthening sleeps, difficulty awakening from sleep, vivid and active dreaming, lung congestion, incontinence, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, etc. Obviously, all of these things are not good signs. However on the other hand, some of those symptoms could be explained by his accident and the narcotics they're using to treat the pain (he's on a fentanyl PCA pump) and sometimes he perks up. Like today, he stayed awake all day (well, for like 9 consecutive hours), and seemed fairly upbeat emotionally.
So, I'm just wondering what others' experiences have been like with loved ones dying* and what the physical experience was like.
Thanks so much in advance for sharing such a difficult and deeply personal part of your life experience with me.

It is extremely rare (one in million), very aggressive with a poor prognosis as it doesn't respond well to treatment. Literally two weeks prior to any symptoms, he had a physical and a blood panel and was given an all clear. He visited me at the end of April, and had swollen glands. By the end of the trip had trouble eating. He said he felt a lump in his throat. I took him into the doctor, but they chalked it up to him fighting a lingering tooth infection. 

I go between waves of shock, numbness, and sadness. My dad is a kind, quiet and gentle soul who has been crushed by the most cruel cancer you can imagine. First, it started to slowly choking him. He had trouble eating and breathing. After being misdiagnosed by an ENT for two weeks, he finally was admitted by a GP to hospital. He recieved a trache only hours after I flew home to see him. That was the last time I got to hear his voice. 

For a week, it seemed like the end. And then he seemed to stabilize. We talked and joked through writing on boards. But scans came in showing it had spread to his lungs, liver, lymphatics and brain. Even still, he pushed on and we had some beautiful moments together for two weeks.

Radiation was offered to hopefully shrink the tumors (growing visibly by the day) and help with the pain. Shortly after that, it all went downhill again. My dad began coughing up blood through his trache. First a little. Then a lot. They told us it might be due to the radiation and should clear up. But it didn't. At which point another specialist came in for another scan and a scope to see if anything else could be done. The answer was no. The tumors had grown so much, he would likely not survive any procedure to cuff the trache. Blood was starting to pool in his lungs.

My dad had another bleeding episode with the specialist there. I can't even tell you how awful it was to see my dad in that state. The blood, the choking, the tears and the fear in his eyes. They said he likely had only a day or two left, and it was going to likely be due to choking on a clot in the tube. Which is exactly what he didn't want. He wrote over and over, I just want it to be in my sleep. I don't want to choke. We were trying everything we could.
We tried one more time to slow the blood, but still he was agitated. Still having episodes. Which left only palliative sedation. 

On Monday night, we talked about our remaining options with my dad. He was ready to go. We hugged him, and I said goodbye to my dad. Even half sedated, he smiled at me, he squeezed my hand, and pulled me in to kiss me on the cheek. The next morning, after another rough night, the Versed was started.

Now, it is so bittersweet to see him finally resting, breathing slowly, but unresponsive. No more kisses. No more hand squeezes. No more I love yous. 

And now, days later, he is still going. His mind was made up, but his body is still strong and is not letting go. It makes me ill to think that this cancer is going to make me watch my dad wither to nothing before it finally takes him. For once, I would just like to know definitevely that we made the right choice. The guilt, the sadness is crushing us all, with no end in sight. 

Thank you for reading, I just need to get this all off my chest tonight. My dad is gone but not gone. It is a horrible limbo.",krittykat,,5,2017-06-17 03:10:34,9,6hr7qe

My mom was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in January. She had one large tumor removed in January. In March, her CT scan showed no tumors. In May, she went to urgent care for abdominal pain and they found four tumors. She started chemo at the beginning of June and has done three sessions. She wanted another scan done before her last chemo session so we did that on Saturday. She got the results today - the previous four tumors have all gotten larger and there are two new ones.

She's seeing her oncologist on Thursday and that last chemo session has been cancelled. So, um, what's next? For those of you with experience, what are we looking at going forward? Are there any experimental treatments for this? Her oncologist mentioned that there is a more aggressive chemo that would need to take place in a hospital but it comes with more intense side effects. I've done some googling but it can be overwhelming. 

Also, assuming there's nothing more we can do, care to share some helpful tips for hospice and end-of-life care? She's already met with the palliative care doctor in her area and the office has some really great connections.

I have been waiting over 8 months to get an appointment for a colonoscopy. I finally had it yesterday, and even as they administering the sedatives the doctor was reassuring me they weren't going to find anything because I was too young. They must have completely knocked me out once they realised what they were finding because the next thing I knew I was waking up in recovery being told the doctor wanted to talk to me. I had started to convince myself I would be told I had celiacs and that I needed to avoid gluten... Nope I was told I had a large ulcerated partially obstructing tumour in my sigmoid colon, and that the next steps were a CT scan in the next week to see if it has spread, and if it hasn't spread then they would cut out the section of my bowel. He said if it has spread then they would only cut out that part of my bowel if it caused a full obstruction for palliative care. 

I can't stop crying! I just turned 34. I am a single parent to a gorgeous 6 year old girl and I can't imagine her pain in growing up without her mum. I want to teach her things and see who she becomes. I want to show her the world. I don't want her to see me suffer and then die. Today I have put her in front of cartoons while I just hide in my room and cry, when I should be cherishing the days I have with her. I'm angry that it has taken 8 months to have a colonoscopy, and those 8 months might be the different between this cancer having spread or not. 

I'm so scared. I feel so cheated :( ",goandloveyourself,,27,2017-07-15 01:29:18,44,6nd9zz

PLEASE SEE YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN YEARLY FOR WOMEN'S/MEN'S HEALTH SCREENINGS

An annual exam may have saved me from this, though my oncologist doesn't believe I've had this longer than a year, pre-dianosis.

My first clue should have been the random menstrual bleeding, which I think started in early 2015. My sweetie and I were in Vegas on vacation, and picking up a new puppy, and I had 2 cycles in one month.

We were planning a July wedding, and with all the hoopla that comes with wedding planning, a 2nd menstrual cycle in July had me chalking the occurrence up to all the stress.

In October 2015, there was significant flooding with my cycle, and at the age of 46, I attributed it to the beginning of menopause. 

More flooding in January and March of 2016, with both of those cycles causing me to miss two days of work from blood loss. There was one night I spent on the toilet for about 90 minutes, continually expressing blood. I've seen menstrual clots in the shower that I could not have cupped in the palm of my hand. 

I saw an endocrinologist, who I told about the odd bleeding, and was prescribed progesterone to help correct that imbalance, testosterone for my lack of libido, and Natur-throid when my bloodwork revealed an underactive thyroid gland.

In September 2016 I started limping at work suddenly, and lost two more days due to pain until hubby suggested I see someone other than my chiropractor. Xrays and an MRI revealed what they thought was sciatica, and I received an injection for that. At my next follow-up with my primary doctor, he informed me that my tests showed bone lesions (random degradation of bone) throughout my lower torso and pelvis, and also that I had a fracture/break of the upper trochanter (the bone area between the ball of the hip and femur/leg bone). Multiple myeloma was suspected, and I was ordered into a wheelchair. 

Hubby bought us two puppies online at the end of the month, and on October 3, 2016, my hip actually broke on a 10 foot walk to the front door, right at 9pm.

Emergency surgery to repair my hip resulted in the insertion of a pin into my hip, a rod down the inside of my femur, and two screws just above the knee. My test results were forwarded to a women's oncology office, and I began radiation on the hip and knee before my hospital discharge (10 radiation sessions total).

I was assigned to palliative care, and learned of the aggressive cervical cancer diagnosis at my first visit with the oncology doctor, confirming a tumor on my cervix.

Women on my mother's side of the family have had women's cancers, but everyone still alive had been ""fixed"" to one degree or another, so I had no one with real family knowledge to discuss this with. 

Chemo began just before my birthday, 2-day regimens including Paclitaxel and Cisplatin, every three weeks. They added Avastin in December or January, after my hip had healed sufficiently.

I applied for disability in January 2017, and was almost immediately approved for benefits. We hadn't asked about the stage of my cancer before then, fearing the worst, and as part of the application for disabilty process, I was asked that information: Stage IVB, with metastasis to my bones. 

In March the Cisplatin was changed to Carboplatin, and that reduced chemo treatments to 1-day sessions. My oncology nurse also prescribed daily Lovenox injections, because that scan revealed a blood clot (pulmonary embolism) in the lower lobe of one lung.

We were gifted a week in Hawaii by close friends in April, hubby flew my Mom here for two weeks in May, we spent a week with his Mom in June, my son flew up at the end of June (and also brought his father and brother in for a few days). We've got more family coming to visit at the end of August.

This week I go in for chemo session 13.

The first scan I had (Dec 2016) after diagnosis showed that the cancer growth was stopped, and the scan in March 2017 only revealed a minimal reduction. I'm due for another scan, expecting that in early August. 

There's essentially no pain other than the tightness in the leg I had surgery on, and that leg remains weak and unreliable for weight bearing. If our furkids run into that leg from behind, it will buckle. My little sports car has sat neglected this year, with me fearful of my ability to operate the clutch reliably in town.

I'm at risk of more broken bones if I fall, and am asked every time about falls when I have blood drawn for labwork or see my oncologist.

Nausea is also nearly nonexistent, other than 2-3 days after each chemo treatment. 

I have rather significant neuropathy in my feet, and that has begun to affect being able to feel the gas or brake pedal in my automatic transmission daily driver. 

I've had genetic testing on the tumor material, but the one clinical trial I was almost a candidate for was not finalized because my cancer was not caused by either HPV16 or HPV18.

I've had conversation with my palliative care nurse about ""long term chemo,"" but there's never been conversation about surgery options, nor how much time I might have left... I have no will, but I have signed personal property titles, just in case.

I'm literally not taking any medication ""as prescribed."" My thyroid prescription is expired, so I really should see about getting that again, though that condition/severity is not life threatening. I haven't taken either the progesterone or testosterone since about October. The omeprazole (Prilosec) was stopped early on, seeming more nonbeneficial than anything. Gabapentin (nerve blocker) was stopped after I developed incontinence, and I've received Lyrica since this spring for my foot neuropathy (which brought back the incontinence). I've stopped the Lovenox injections, because Ihatezneedlez!

Hubby wants to look at ""other options"" for treatment if the next scan doesn't show any forward progress, though I question why other places would or would not have different treatments available for me.

I would dearly love to hear the word remission, or No Evidence of Disease, but at this point, that may not happen. 

The pups are greatly therapeutic for my attitude, though I can't run to catch them. Our plans include breeding them next year, until I wonder about if I'll even still be here. We also just celebrated our 2nd anniversary (have known each other more than 17 years), and I try really hard not to focus on or think about the planning of my funeral. I AM TOO YOUNG FOR THE PUPS, MY HUSBAND, MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS, AND MY ENEMIES TO BE WITHOUT ME. 

When compared to two years ago, the quality of life for me has gone so far downhill I wonder at my ability to soldier on through it, but at the same time, my feet hit the floor hours before I even realize I'm awake - they always have. I want my life back, I want to know I can run like the maniac I've always been, I want to work an exhausting 40 hour week doing more than what my job description calls for, I want to run my bank account nearly into the red with trips to hang out with my best friend, just because she's there. 

Life just doesn't have a TL:DR, but I fear I'm going to be fed one, which makes me more scared for everyone I love, than for myself.

When this first happened, he was essentially told my his doctor that because of his COPD there was nothing they could do, no treatment, nothing, and he was just to receive palliative care. He was admitted to hospital a few weeks after that after having a panic attack and, when my mum and I went in to see him, we both genuinely thought he had days left, if that.

My mum got in touch with a surgeon that operated on my Dad a few years ago and a through a MacMillan nurse my Dad got a second opinion from this surgeon. Again it's more than likely that it is lung cancer but the surgeon was genuinely concerned my Dad had been written off. He arranged for radiotherapy and my Dad had five sessions of that.

The recovery from that took about three weeks but he is looking and feeling so, so, so much better. He had a follow-up appointment last week and, although he didn't want to see the X-Ray, his doctor was confident they had halted the spread of the tumour and it has shrunk enough to really improve my Dad's quality of life. He's able to get around the house, he's not confined to bed, he's not having panic attacks for shortness of breath, and he doesn't need to go back for an appointment for another three months. And they said that if the tumour flares up he can get some more radiotherapy. He's got oxygen at home and is much, much more positive about the next couple of years.

My mum and dad are now booking a few days away down South. A few months ago we thought he wouldn't be here, but hopefully this radiotherapy has bought him an extra couple of years.

The Clara Barton parkway has the little lots by the Potomac. There's a steady, heavy rain on the roof of this borrowed car. It won't last long. Blue sky and sunshine are at the horizon, even while lightening flashes above.

I don't want to go home. If it was just my husband I'd rush to him. But my mom is there and my kids. 

My kids. Every time I think of them the screen of my phone blurs away.  Just today my daughter cried when I left for my appointment. She doesn't do that often, because appointments for me are usually 2-3 times weekly. But she was feeling exceptionally attached today. She sat on my lap this morning. She asked if I would nap with her. She 6, she doesn't even nap anymore. But she wanted time with just me, away from the 5 other kids my mom provides daycare for at our house.

Instead, I read to her. I'm trying to ease her into chapter books. But after one short chapter, I acquiesced to her demand that I read some Bernstein Bears. It hurt to read that long. By the time I was done I was taking long, raspy breaths every few sentences. I read through the pain to my son last night, too, continuing my lifelong ambition to read Harry Potter aloud to my kids. My daughter doesn't like it, but my son(8) and I just started the Goblet of Fire.

My doctor wants me to get a tracheotomy. Permanent this time. But it won't remove all the fingers of cancer gripping my throat. It will just keep me from dying in an ambulance due to this growing airway obstruction. Or, as he says, ""for comfort."" I wonder how much effort reading will be with the tracheotomy.

I've had other doctors tell me I'm dying before. But I never could conceive of it being imminent. There is something about struggling to breathe that makes the whole thing much more concrete than past times. 

I've also had more fight in me before. I've known I could make it through more chemo, more radiation, more surgery. Four and a half years into this and I don't feel so certain. Surgery won't take this out.  Neither will radiation. So... chemo is left and I can safely say I'd rather be dead than back on a platinum based chemotherapy.

I don't want to go home. It used to be the thing I feared the most was my kids not remembering me. Now it's the conversation that is looming, closer than ever. The moment when we sit them down and have to tell them I'm done trying.

I don't want to go home, because maybe that day is today. Maybe tonight I'll sign a DNR and tomorrow I'll tell my oncologist that we are switching to palliative treatments only.

I didn't think this was coming today. Not really. And I have to make my decision before I get home.


(10 miles later)

I stopped again, after the rain cleared. I bought myself chocolate, and I got a shirt for my son, a stuffed animal for my daughter, and a candy bar for my husband. I'm not sure what my goal is here. Is this supposed to ease this news?

A month ago my doctors told me that everything looked clear. No new growth. I wasn't expecting that. I thought (at the time) the news was bad. My husband came with me to that appointment. He called my dad on the way home with the good news.

When we pulled in, my kids came running out to the car. They were screaming, giddy from the news. We went inside and they could just not calm down. Neither could I. We did a dance party in the kitchen and I gave them ice cream before bed.

But tge pain and swelling kept getting worse. And here I am, hoping some candy and trinkets will ease the anxiety for my kids. The memory of that night a month ago makes my dread for tonight so much worse.

(30 miles later)

I'm only 10 minutes from home when I get back in my car.  There is a little place where you can look over the valley of our town. I live on the mountain on the other side. I'm staring over at my mountain, hearing and seeing my familyn still not finding the words to say to my kids. 

 Somebody ate all the chocolate. Maybe if I stall long enough they'll be in bed.

Anyway, I should get back in the car. Thanks to anyone who listened to my stream of consciousness thus far.

(Home)

I flicked off my lights as I pulled in the driveway. I'm hoping nobody notices I'm sitting out here. As soon as I slam shut the door of the car, this isn't my private pain anymore. It belongs to those I love the most, too.

I've tried before to lie, to not let them know when it is serious. I never make it long. 

I wanted to make a decision about what direction to go before I got home.  I haven't. Here is what I have decided: to go on a walk with my husband. To take my kids to the lake tomorrow. To put off an appointment with my oncologist one more day.

My husband just texted me. Deep breaths. In I go.

It has metastasized to my bones, and caused a fracture/break of the upper left trochanter, and I was hospitalized for the break in early October 2016. A pin, a rod, and 2 screws from the hip, down the femur, and just above the knee rendered me structurally intact. Radiation (10 sessions) began before I was discharged, and chemo took place from October 2016 through July 2017. The most recent PET scan revealed that chemo has stopped working for me, and my cervical tumor and liver lesions have begun growing again. 
We live in Alaska, my treatments have been at Providence Alaska's Women's Cancer Care Center, and my husband recently reached out to The Cancer Center of America (Phoenix, Arizona). It is expected that we are traveling there at the end of August 2017.
It is believed that the treatment they're going to suggest involves immunotherapy, and I wonder that treatment outside Alaska will be significantly different or better than the treatment and care I've received in Alaska.
I was assigned to palliative care as well, at the beginning of all of this, though I've not dealt with significant pain or problems with nausea. My oncologist had remarked at least twice to me that I have ""handled this exceedingly well,"" considering my lack of problem symptoms, and that my system must be incredibly strong to have been on the 3 week regimen of Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Zometa, and Avastin (Avastin started Dec 2016, was halted July 2017 due to loose teeth and dental infections) for this long. She said she had never given this regimen to one patient for so long. 
I had three teeth removed in July 2017, and will be seeing a periodontist early next week for an assessment before my dentist agrees to remove more - I'm back on Amoxicillin, with at least 2 more loose teeth, with the expectation of losing those and 2 additional teeth that have been painful.

To say the least: I'm frightened beyond words. The internet has me believing that this IS a death sentence, of which I'm in complete and utter denial of. I'm still a newlywed, and cannot fathom the idea that I will not be around to share the next 30 years of life with the most perfect of husbands. We are also parents to three young furbabies, which he will likely not be able to keep after my passing.
I have not worked, nor been able to work since the diagnosis and hip break, I am classified as handicapped, I require electric buggies when I am shopping, wheelchairs for traveling, and have not participated in physical therapy at all. My little sports car has been neglected all year, for my fear of being unable to shift her manual transmission with functional reliability. I do not see late stage cervical cancer survivor stories anywhere. I have no will, and no real property to worry about disbursement of, though I have already signed titles for the two pieces of personal property that I own. 

Is there any light at the end of this tunnel?? Can someone please give me hope towards either of the magic words remission or NED? I spend way too much time home alone, and disability benefits don't include enough money to keep my gas tank full for the purpose of visiting friends, nor do I have the energy or stamina for anything remotely approaching ""having a life.""

THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST CAGE, EVER. 

UPDATE: 
Periodontist said that the looseness of my teeth may entirely be attributable to the chemo regimen; he is not recommending further extractions at this time. I was given another prescription for Amoxicillin and one other antibiotic, which he believes will increase my overall mouth health. Says teeth are not held in directly by jawbone tissue alone, but by ligament material first, and the other antibiotic has been known to improve gum health (which hopefully improves the ligaments, as my body recovers from three chemo poisons.

I'm not asking anyone to read that now. Here I want to focus on only one important question:

To what extent is an oncologist supposed to tell you about the potential consequences of your choices?

When my father's PSA started rising faster while on Zytiga (abiraterone), he was offered the option of chemo for his prostate cancer. During several appointments, he was merely told about the the PSA, CT scan, and sometimes bone scan results, and asked if he wanted chemo. He wasn't told anything about how that choice might influence events in the future.

My father chose to not do chemo. Considering chemo side effects, that's very understandable when he wasn't told anything about how chemo might benefit him.

In his last appointment, he was offered radiation. When he said no to that he was referred to his family doctor. We got a call from his office, asking if he wanted a referral to palliative care via hospice, at home or at hospice. The family doctor said there is nothing else they can do. So, at the time he didn't know he was choosing between radiation and hospice. Probably the oncologist should have known this was the other option, and surely he's also able to make the referral to hospice.

So, is this sort of thing normal or this oncologist seem bad? I know you can't know how the patient will respond to treatment, but without at least some info about potential effects, how is the patient supposed make decisions?",ontsux,,6,2017-10-23 19:46:21,8,78ab4o

Since then she has completed 6 rounds of chemotherapy, which shrank some of her tumors but did not completely eliminate all of them. She was very sick in June before she started chemo and after her first round. The rest of the summer she actually looked really good and was out and about all over the place.  After finishing her chemo, she became confused and had to be admitted for s few days. They moved up her radiation treatments to treat the brain tumors. 

Two weeks ago she completed radiation and she has been incredibly sick. Constant nausea and vomiting despite taking Zofran, Phenergan, Reglan. She's been admitted to the hospital twice, once for cellulitis/pneumonia and now for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. She has had a history of low sodium and low magnesium and is supposed to be taking supplements at home. When I took her to the emergency room on Monday, I found out that she had been refusing to take her recommended dose of sodium because she hates the taste, and she totally stopped taking her magnesium because she says it gives her diarrhea (which I know can be a side effect, but it also could be the radiation). 

She was supposed to be discharged home today but went unresponsive and has had two seizures and episodes of cardiac arrhythmias. I'm a cardiac nurse, so I understand how her electrolyte imbalance could have caused that. I witnessed her second seizure and subsequent cardiac arrhythmia and I have never been so scared in my entire life. She quickly became responsive and received more magnesium and potassium replacements in addition to an extra dose of Keppra. They're also holding off on giving her zofran because of the cardiac effects it can have. It's upsetting because she is so nauseous and can't seem to get any relief, especially now that she can't take Zofran.

My main concern is that when she gets discharged, she will refuse to take her medicine again. She is a former oncology nurse, so she knows the implications of her not taking her meds. I have also found out that she is continuing to smoke which really upsets me. She is fighting so hard with the chemo and radiation so I simply cannot understand why she won't take her medications and she continues to smoke. If she was not trying to beat this and wanted just palliative care, I would be less upset about the smoking. I'm even more upset that she is refusing to take her medications. I'm praying that these two events will make her more compliant, but I know her and how stubborn she can be. How can we get her to take her supplements?

Also, does anyone have experience on how to handle being a health care employee and watching your parent go through this? I've read a lot of journals and I know the prognosis for her. I've been cautiously optimistic but also recognizing that this is not a curable form of cancer, especially with how advanced it was when she was diagnosed. When I witnessed her second seizure/episode of torsades, I called for the nurses to come in, and I had to leave the room when they brought the code cart in (she was briefly pulseless and was completely pale). I felt so embarrassed that I'm a nurse but I had to fly out of the room because I was terrified that she would need CPR/defibrillation and I just couldn't watch it. It's hard having enough medical knowledge to be know all of the things that can go wrong. 

Sorry for how long this is, I hope I was able to make sense. I'm not able to sleep because I'm terrified I will get a phone call from the hospital saying that she had another event. Thank you in advance to anyone that read all of this and can offer advice...or even just support. ",AlysanneTargaryean,,5,2017-11-08 05:41:00,9,7bjcji

I am not diagnosed with cancer although my Mom was diagnosed with an ""advanced stage"" of cervical cancer the week of October 1st. It's a long story but I'll try to keep it short and in the end I'm looking for insight and hopefully advice or guidance.
My Mom was already suffering from a severe depression leading up to all of this and it has worsened with diagnosis which is of course very understandable. 

Here is a breakdown of how things happened: 
- suffered renal failure July 9th &amp; had nephrostomy tubes inserted
- found mass in bladder that week but thought it was scar tissue from a string of UTIs
- October 1st: head to emerge where a barrage of tests led to discovery of mass on cervix which is cancer that spread to colon, lymph nodes and vaginal walls. We are told it is ""advanced"" but no stage and my mom stopped the appointment entirely and would not hear any more information or allow us to know more.
- Mom agreed after 1 week to radiation and she had 10 treatments total
- we were told she would be getting chemo as well to help but it is palliative care/symptom management and not operable or curable
- no further treatment or appointments have taken place since her last radiation appt. 

As of today, my mom's depression has led her to a really dark place and I don't know how to help. She has been lying to family members and cancelling her consultation appt with the chemo doctor for the past 3 weeks. She won't recognize the word cancer or discuss it at all, not a word with anyone and is pretending nothing is wrong. Doesn't answer calls and only watches tv all day. It's absolutely breaking my heart watching my formerly chubby happy mama getting thinner and more withdrawn by the day. She is somewhat refusing treatment by not allowing any appointments to occur which is entirely up to her but I don't know what to do. I feel so helpless and like I'm failing her. I can't get any information from doctors because she is of sound mind. 

What can I do to help her? Should I be following her lead or trying to advocate for her care instead? I visit as often as possible, call every day even if she doesn't answer. Can anyone offer any guidance or insight? Have you experienced these feelings or situations? 

Thanks so much in advance. I just want to help my mama find some peace of mind and feel supported in her day to day. Sigh.

We think it will, but if it doesn’t, she’s gonna be referred to palliative care. 

That word - palliative - hit me like a punch to the gut. 

I work in hospice/palliative (inpatient and in-home) and I’ve seen the progression of pancreatic cancer firsthand. I know it’s coming *one day*, but that doesn’t make it any easier. I’m having a tough time processing this. 

I’m trying hard to remind myself that she’s still here *now*, and we can still enjoy life while it lasts, for however long that may be. I’m just tired. Tired from being her FT caregiver and working FT, tired of hospitalizations, tired of seeing her jaundiced, gaunt, and in pain. Cancer really takes a toll on everyone involved, in different ways. 

On the positive side, she’s got a fighting spirit. I’ve seen patients give up, and they usually transition to active dying shortly after. But she’s not giving up. She’s the strongest woman I’ve ever met and I am truly blessed to call her my mother. 

**Edit**: I just wanted to make it clear that palliative care doesn’t mean my mom is *actively* dying or “giving up.” Like I said, I work in hospice/palliative. I’m only saying that it’s hard to admit that you need help.  ",MyOwnGuitarHero,,8,2017-12-02 13:40:45,23,7h2o71

I posted here a month or so ago talking about how my dad had been diagnosed with cirrhosis, hep c and, lastly, liver cancer. As is normal with this cancer (so I've learned) it was found in a very late stage. It is very aggressive. In the last month his eyes have turned entirely yellow. 

Oncologist told us a week ago that if he isn't stronger by the 19th we'll have to resort to palliative care as he will be too weak for chemo; it would kill him in less than a month. He isn't getting much better. Doctor told us if that is the case he'll only have 2 to 3 months left (research has proven that common). Should I accept the 2 to 3 month span or is there any other possible treatment? Surgery, immunotherapy, and radiation are off the table as well. Will everything be too much for him to handle if the chemo is?

Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this. If it's not, please let me know and I'll direct it to the right one.

We have a complicated situation. My mom, 64, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in October 2014. They didn't expect her to live past a year. But she responded well to palliative chemo and immunotherapy and has survived the past three years with tons of ups and downs. The trend is slowly downwards, however, to the point where she's now quite weak. She sleeps for days at a time and generally doesn't do more than watch television.

She's an incredibly strong woman with an iron will, which has gotten her this far in life. That iron will means she is also incredibly stubborn. She has 100% refused hospice care of any kind because ""they just want to pump you full of drugs and kill you as fast as possible"". She refuses to give up smoking; she still sucks down at least a pack a day despite being barely able to breath even at a rest. She refuses oxygen because it means she can't smoke.

She has been unbelievably depressed for the past three years, but absolutely refuses to talk to any of the free counselors at the hospital because ""what the fuck does a 26-year-old social worker know about life?"" I have offered to locate and pay for private counselling with a social worker or therapist who is closer to her age and who specializes in terminal cancer patients. She has refused this as well, because ""what's the point? I'm going to be dead soon anyway.""

She refuses to eat anything except for candy. She refuses to drink anything except tea and Diet Pepsi. She refuses to stay in bed, insisting she get up to make tea for herself or go get soda.

She has fallen a number of times over the past six months, causing all kinds of terrifying but fortunately non-life-threatening injuries. At this point she's so tired most of the time that she falls asleep mid-sentence or will fall asleep standing up. We'll put her to bed when she's almost like a zombie from fatigue. A half-hour later she'll be up and staggering around the kitchen, dropping coffee mugs and ash trays. When we insist she go to bed and that we'll get her anything she wants, she gets very angry, saying it's not our place to boss her around and SHE CAN DO IT HERSELF. Lather, rinse, repeat until she finally passes out.

My sister and my father live at home with her and take care of her. I make frequent trips home to help relieve them. On top of all this, their house is a gigantic disaster area because mom used to clean and tidy everything and my dad and my sister simply don't know how to care for themselves. My parents' extremely dysfunctional relationship stalled an ambitious renovation they started 13 years ago. So the house is only half-finished and is like a giant, filthy hoarder's den. It's one massive trip hazard for even a healthy person, let alone a late-stage cancer patient who is unsteady on her feet.

Our strategy has just been to entertain her whims and keep her safe and happy until she's too sick to fight going into hospice. Thing is, mom's cancer is spreading really slowly. Her oncologist said she's actually quite healthy in that regard. No tumors in any major organs or in her brain, only her lungs and in some other small non-vital areas. She could very well go on living for another year, maybe even two years. Who knows?

In the meantime, she will fight tooth-and-nail for her independence. But it will inevitably end up with her falling asleep with a lit cigarette in bed, falling and breaking a hip, or some other disaster that will affect us all.

My mom was actually a great person before all of this. But the disease has morphed someone very dedicated and focused into a bitter, angry woman in total denial about her frailty. We all love her very much and we understand her anger, but she refuses to come to terms with her illness. It's destroying our family. My sister and dad are exhausted and angry all of the time. They overeat junk food and their general health is in the toilet (Dad has developed diabetes. They both barely sleep). I've developed a stress-related illness because of three years of relentless ups and downs. We're all guiltily hoping she dies soon so this ugly situation just finally ends.

This is a horrible situation that none of us are equipped to handle. We don't know where to turn. What do we do? Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** Mom is slowly dying of lung cancer, refuses to come to terms with it. It's destroying our family and putting her at  unnecessary risk. Help.",trowawee1122,,6,2017-12-15 04:12:38,5,7jxbud

Actually, diagnosed with a tumor in October - had a biopsy over Thanksgiving that returned with that pathology. 

Before the biopsy his brain was compensating and other than some of the side effects that we now know were from the tumor (hiccups, nausea) he was doing fine. Great even. Since the biopsy, things have been really rough. Recurrence of symptoms, inability to stay hydrated. It’s likely that his tumor has put out some feelers into an area of his brain stem that controls his blood pressure - now it’s being controlled (barely) by an aggressive cocktail of medication. He’s not stable enough to withstand the radiation that he is supposed to start next week. 

So now he’s home. Waiting to see if these meds can stabilize him enough, along with some palliative care at home, to get to radiation. There have been lots of tough conversations about time - quality and quantity, and truthfully I can’t see him stabilizing enough to get to treatment. The end just seems to be accelerating - despite whatever hope that I’m trying to hold on to. This just has moved so fast and sucks so much. My family lives about 7 hours away - so it’s a gift to be home to help my mom and spend some time with my dad. 

Here’s my question - I have a little less than a week with him here at my parent’s house. He spends most of the day in bed. What would you do to best use this time that I won’t get back, might never have again. What questions would you ask? What would you say? He’s sleeping now, but I don’t want to waste away the time that I do have in the days to come. ",katie_pants1298,,1,2017-12-24 03:41:13,5,7lt1b5

I’ve lurked here casually for a while but this is a first post in this sub, my apologies for length and if similar posts are available (search was no help). My dad was diagnosed 7 years ago with colon and bladder cancer. The bladder cancer was removed and has not recurred to our knowledge. The colon cancer has persisted and he’s had a spot on his lungs for the last few years as well. He is 69.
Last month his doctor raised the possibility of stopping the chemo because it doesn’t seem to be working anymore and his Pet scan shows some new spots and growth in old spots, plus his CEA has been rising. My dad is adamant that he will fight to the end and said no, he wants to try another chemo. So the new drug started two weeks ago. It’s seriously kicking his ass. It was apparent almost immediately that he is too weak to have this drug on a regular basis for the full course. He can’t sleep due to mystery pain in his back, then he could no longer use his right arm due to mystery pain in his shoulder. He has stopped eating altogether, except for cannabis edibles. On bad days he sleeps most of the day and doesn’t really move much. On good days he seems happy to see us and sits in his chair most of the time, but always there is pain and fatigue. Within the last two weeks he can no longer drive or dress himself. It’s been a very sudden and shocking decline after 7 years of on and off chemo and a relatively decent quality of life, playing with grandkids, going on trips, etc. 

My mom is losing it. He refuses to talk to her about anything, let her come to appointments with him, or make any kind of arrangements for the future: financial, medical, logistical plans are non-existent. She has no idea what his prognosis is or how to deal with any of this. 
He is not accepting the reality of what’s happening, and I’m trying to be understanding and not push him and cause an argument. But it’s clear this new drug is a drastic change in quality of life. It feels unsustainable. He refuses all pain medication except the cannabis, which doesn’t appear to even be touching the pain he’s in right now. He has taken oral painkillers in the past and didn’t like how he felt, so now he won’t take anything. 

His hospital offers palliative care concurrent with treatment. So he doesn’t have to stop chemo and can get some help with all of this. It feels like we’re losing precious time because he won’t ask for help with his symptoms. Is there any way to broach the subject with him?  I know this may seem random but maybe someone will understand: he’s a Vietnam veteran (army infantry drafted 1969-1970), and his general temperament and stress responses are all affected by a decent amount of post traumatic stress and a general distrust of humanity and authority. He is also stubborn and fiercely independent and always has been. He is likely to see palliative care as “giving up” and the thing that people do when there’s no hope left. He may respond better to me than to my mom (or really anyone) if I can find a way to bring it up lovingly at the right time. I understand everyone is different but can anyone share their experience helping a loved one come to terms with new realities and make the adjustment?  Any insight into palliative care alongside treatment?  I’m just figuring this out as I go and I’ve only started looking into what palliative care is in the last few days.

My wife was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer back in May of 2014. We have known the whole time that she is getting palliative care. With that being said she has come along way since she was diagnosed. She has already had whole brain radiation and whole spine radiation in addition to some targeted radiation for newer tumors in her brain. She started on Alectinib for a study and has been on it for about 35 months now. It has inhibited the cancer from growing for now but her brain is the primary concern at the moment. 

She had an MRI last week after telling her oncologist that she was having some new symptoms that consist of sharp pains and vision issues. This promoted the MRI to be moved up by 3 weeks. The results were mostly what we had known previously. There are two current tumors that have been stable in size for at least the past year. The sizes are 3mm and 7mm and both of which have already had targeted therapy done. 

The new thing on the MRI shows a 1.6mm x 1.9mm area of vasogenic edema that is around the 7mm tumor. My wife oncologist referred us to the radiologist and he said he couldn’t use targeted radiation on that area again so he is suggesting have it treated with proton therapy via referral.

The big question - is this normally how vasogenic edema is treated? I know we need to see what the proton radiologist has to say but I was wondering if anyone has experienced something like this before to give us some insight. ",afast67stang,,10,2018-02-08 16:19:11,3,7w5x9m

I thought it was the perfect ending, and that they would be able to live into retirement together. However that's not to be....

My moms partner, ""Deanna"" had cancer a few years ago and beat it. However we just learned yesterday that it came back and is automatically a stage 4. It is in her lungs, her liver, and other parts of her body. My mom is a nurse practitioner and does work with cancer patients. She and the doctors understand it's terminal and she will have to go to palliative chemo. Deanna has a strong will to live though and said she's going to try to fight it as much and as long as she can. She's very hopeful which is a good thing and a tribute to her wonderful character.

This is where I come in. I don't know much about cancer. I'm 18 and going to college 30 minutes away from my home. I've never known anyone with cancer and never been affected by it before. I'm grieving with the rest of our family but also keeping my head high.

Im currently off my immune supression drugs because as the oncologist put it, ""its like throwing gasoline on a fire', when it comes to the cancer. So the treatment for one basically contradicts treatment of the other. 

Help? Any info about how to get started or who to talk to would be really appreciated. ",MyOversoul,t3_8bznq8,24,2018-04-13 14:40:54,5,8bznq8

Also a lot of venting.,"I made a post a week or so ago asking if I should move back in with my parents as we just found out my dad has stage IV cancer in the colon that has spread to his liver. For now my decision has been to stay home with them for a couple months for his first couple rounds of chemo and go from there...

Fast forward to now, hes got a home health nurse and we are also in the process of setting up his palliative care stuff. And have been going back and forth from the hospital to talk to nutritionists, his oncologist, his surgeon, etc. I assume nurses and doctors don't take it personal because it's their job but I think my dad is a very difficult patient...he has an extremely short temper, refuses to listen to any doctors orders (he had a heart attack last year linked to his smoking and now even diagnosed with cancer chain smokes regularly) and basically is kind of a macho asshole sometimes. He will make jokes with nurses one second then questions their every move the next. Calling them useless money grabbers that all this is a racket cooked up by doctors and hospitals. Maybe it kind of is...but damn dude they are the best shot we got at making you sure you get a good quality of life! What the fuck man. He's my dad and I love him. It's tough to sit there and listen to him berate people who are trying to help him. Including me. I understand he is going through a difficult time. But this isn't a change in behavior for him due to his illness...its kinda how he's always been. It's partly why I even moved away, despite the fact that in our culture its normal to live with your parents until you are married. But my folks were kinda hard to be around, and as soon as I was able I left.

I dunno. But now I am here. Trying to be there because my mom is in her 60s still doin the 9-5 and no one else can be home with him. I feel like an asshole because of the state he's in. I hate that it gives him a pass to be ugly towards others and it makes it hard for me to feel empathy for him sometimes. How to deal?",wolfandfish,t3_8dlurs,12,2018-04-20 07:35:46,5,8dlurs
/r/cancer/comments/8e8kr0/feeling_guilty_about_feeling_hurt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/8e8kr0/feeling_guilty_about_feeling_hurt/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Feeling guilty about feeling hurt,"So a rough outline of my situation:

My Nonna, my world in a person, the only person whose unconditional love I have ever felt, passed last February from liver cancer. I spent my days and most of my nights with her at her home and then got her into palliative care when I could no longer physically maneuver her, myself. I held her hand and watched her die before me. 

This past December, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer (a year after her mother was diagnosed with liver cancer). She had a lumpectomy in February, 4 days before I had my second daughter. Cancer cells spread to her lymph nodes and she began chemo earlier this month. 

Basicslly- my mom and I have always had a very....tense? Relationship. I have always been jealous of her social life and her consistently choosing her friends and hobbies over everything else, including me and my girls. It has been something I have working through for years. After my Nonna died, we moved 45 minutes away from my mom, into a new city. With my mom undergoing treatment, and the continued grief from loosing my Nonna, having a newborn with a preschooler, in a different city....I have been struggling. A lot. My husband will be taking paternal leave for the months of June and July so that I can be with my mom and he can watch my eldest who is 4. We are in no way financially able to do this, but we have been selling many of our belongings and have gotten creative to try and raise money to mend the gap. 

Well, my mom has undergone 2 treatments thus far. Thankfully, she has not had too many adverse side effects, other than a foggy head and moments of exhaustion. After her first treatment, she went on a week long trip with my father, which I thought was great. Well, after this past treatment, she went to her book club and theatre, but was too exhausted from those things, to come and see me and my daughters (I had gone up to see her prior to her second treatment, with my 2 month old, to get our hair cut so I could support her). 

The day after I went with her to get our hair cut, my eldest broke down and cried. She missed my mom and dad. She has been through a hell of a lot in the past few years of her very short life, dealing with all of this stuff. I helped her call my dad and she told him how much he missed them and wanted to see them. Dad told her that my mom was resting and as soon as she felt better, they would visit. As I spoke with him to get an update on my mom, my daughter went up to her room and sobbed. When I went to see her, she asked me why my mom was sick and needed to rest....my heart shattered for her. I told my mom the following day how much my daughter missed her...

And I wrote a novel....well, basically...I'm hurt. I'm hurt that again, mom chose her friends and clubs and hobbies, over me and my family, when we are so desperate to spend time with her. Feeling hurt, however, has me feeling guilty...I'm glad she is up and about and not allowing this to get her down, thus far...but I am also realistic and know that she can't keep this momentum up for the entire duration of her treatment....I am sad that she is choosing to spend the time she is not at doctors appointments and resting, away from me and my girls.....I feel selfish and awful for feeling sad about this. Loosing my Nonna broke me, I just want my mom.....I want to spend time with my mom....(and yes, she knows how desperate I am to spend time with her, because I've told her, and she always has a great time when we do see eachother, so I just don't know)

How do you deal with negative emotions towards those you love with cancer, and all the guilt that accompanies feeling anything but positive about them?

It’s very rare, and the biopsy was inconclusive, but her Dr (a very experienced oncologist) has basically told her to be prepared. They’re taking the tumor out at this moment and I’m in the surgical waiting room - once it’s out they’ll be able to diagnose which type of cancer they have but she has all the textbook signs of the worst. 

From what I understand, anaplastic has a very poor outlook - it’s pretty much a no survival rate. It just spreads aggressively all over her body and her organs shut down. It’s very painful way to go and I can’t even think about her suffering like that. She’s the only family I have. 

I’m just waiting now. The waiting sucks. I’m preparing myself but it’s rare enough that I can’t talk to anyone who has been around it before. I know they would normally put her through a very aggressive radiation/chemo combination to try to prolong her life for a little bit but it feels horrible and usually has no effect on prognosis from what I understand. 

I don’t know what I can do to help. There’s the biggest cancer centers but they always want to push for any experimental procedure they can because they do research - the opportunity for subjects with anaplastic cancer doesn’t come up often. I just don’t know what to do. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? What can I expect? Was there any attempt to treat it or just palliative? This is just all happening so fast and I really don’t know what to do. I’ve even been sitting here looking up which states allow assisted suicide after reading about a patient with ATC whose tumor just grew until they couldn’t stop it from slowly asphyxiating her.

I’m on mobile, so this post seems like a long one. Apologies if it is. 

My Mom’s a very private woman and doesn’t want me sharing her condition or journey with her friends, so I figured anonymous strangers would be a better option. 

My mom found a lump near her hip back in November. She went to the doctor, who thought it was a dermatology issue and sent her away with a referral. I wish he would have performed an ultrasound himself instead of sending out the referral, as it took 2 months to get seen. 

The dermatologist also agreed that she needed an ultrasound, but as she didn’t feel it was a dermatology issue, she sent her back to her primary. 

The primary finally put in a referral for an excision biopsy, which is when they remove whatever’s in you to take a look at it. 

That was February 12th. It took about four months to get to this point. 

Two weeks later, on the 27th, we went back in for our diagnosis and pathology determined that it was a rare form of Lymphoma.

This was devastating to my mom. She just lost her brother to cancer, and of course was too emotional to know that this cancer was one of the least fatal. And before anyone says that’s the “cancer you want to have”, we know, we’d just still prefer no cancer. 

Her primary put in a referral for an oncologist, and four days later saw her neurologist on an unrelated note. 

Here’s what’s interesting. Her neurologist was part of a different network, tied to a prestigious research and cancer center in San Diego. 

She was in such bad shape by this point, both from the actual cancer and the shock associated, that her neurologist personally referred her to be seen by someone in HIS network. 

Insurance approved this, and we went down to meet the specialist, a national expert and instructor in the field. She’s wonderful and cares deeply. 

This cancer center has many benefits that I didn’t even know existed. First off, my mom was approved for a few replacements for the ABVD cocktail that would harm her body less. Second, they provide palliative care to each patient, even the ones with less fatal forms of cancer like my mom’s. 

Two weeks ago was her first chemo. She was actually fine for three days, to the point where it seemed like she’d pull through this without many symptoms. 

We made the mistake of getting a little too hopeful, and on day 5 her fever was 100.5 and she was screaming in pain, vomiting several times an hour. 

We took her to the hospital, where they put her in an isolated room. Unfortunately, this didn’t stop her from getting MRSA, and with her neutropenic fever, her condition quickly deteriorated. 

She’s been in the hospital for 5 days now, and is basically being kept in a Dilatid fueled coma. We talk maybe once a day, and she’s in a tremendous amount of pain. 

I didn’t really have any purpose in writing this other than the fact that I just needed to write it. Thanks for reading ",derpflarpington,t3_8kfmx3,2,2018-05-18 19:03:06,15,8kfmx3

We were practically sisters from kindergarten until double digits, then moved apart and lost touch. I tracked her down online around 5 years ago.

Her doctors let her take this trip, uninsured, and I’m a lucky side visit. She’s been doing every fun thing available in my current home country. 

I’m sad to farewell my friend because we aren’t guaranteed to meet again. But I feel privileged to have been shown a brave and tenacious way to live when time is short and a body is uncooperative. 

I imagine people are in this group for many reasons and some of you are unable to live as you would wish. But even if it’s getting to a window to watch a bird, I hope you can make your day more enjoyable today.

Feeling stuck.,"I was told today by my doctors that in all likelihood, my life is going to be lived in 3-month intervals for the foreseeable future. 

 -- Get a full scan run. 

 -- See how the cancer is growing (or not). 

 -- Decide to continue with current treatment or try a new treatment based on that information.  

 -- Wait 3 more months for another scan run.

 -- Repeat.

I have already been going through this so far this year (since my diagnosis at the end of last year), and I thought there might be an end in sight, but I was mistaken. I am trying to go to school, trying to work, but have been very limited with regards to both, and don't even get me started on trying to date.

There is no cure currently, so treatments are mostly palliative or delay tactics, hoping for advancements in the future. And because its stage IV and my liver area is heavily involved, I am already committed to symptom medications consistently which cause their own side effects but at least prevents life-threatening symptoms from popping up. Treatments will likely consist of trying various drugs, chemo, and a liver transplant as a last resort (although that's just an endgame delay tactic and comes with its own risks). There may also be continued surgeries in certain areas, again, as a delay tactic.

HOW?

HOW do I live my life 3 months at a time endlessly waiting for the next scan run. It feels like I cant plan for anything because I never know if in 3 months the scans will result in a drastic change, or medication that has serious side effects, or surgery. I cant commit to any type of schedule as it pertains to life (work, school, romantic) that's longer than 2-3 months.  I feel stuck.

So I am asking here, anyone who has had to live their life in a similar way, a few months at a time, how do I wrap my head around it and how do I make it work?  Because I am struggling to find a direction here.",Noexit007,t3_8lezzt,11,2018-05-23 00:19:16,9,8lezzt

Looking for some advice, my mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 Squamos Cell carcinoma in Canada. She was refused treatment and suggested to focus on palliative care and pain management. We as a family did not take that well, and took her to Pakistan \- where the Oncologists suggested they can try adminstering chemotherapy (not with a curative intent, but to basically get more time with mom) \- the two drugs they were going to give her were carboplatin and taxol. Having said that, her condition improved, and she became stronger and was not in perpetual pain that she was in when in Canada. In April (2018) a CT scan was done and the tumors appeared to be shrinking. However a follow up CT scan in May shows that the tumors are growing again.

Now that the tumors are becoming resistive, I have heard of immunotherapy, that pembrolizumab is quite effective on squamos cell carcinoma. 

I am really confused, and scared \- and would like some advice if there is anything I can do? I know cure is not possible, but to get some more time with my beloved mother. Your advice would be greatly appreciated.",ZeeshK,,7,2018-06-06 19:01:10,16,8p3cku

It was liver cancer. I was studying abroad at the time and recently on break I got to visit her while she was undergoing treatment in China.

She is getting skinnier day-by-day and had such an adverse reaction to treatment that now they are just performing palliative care. She can’t walk and barely eats because her stomach is swollen.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I do in these last 7 days? My grandma was with me everyday while I was growing up and she has always been my inspiration. She would get up early at 6 am to prepare lunches for me and my brothers, sew our clothes when we ripped them and do our laundry for us. She would take care of us when we were sick, try teach us Mandarin (she used to be a principal at a Chinese school), hug us when we were sad etc.

Lately I have just been feeling very lost and don’t know what I can do. I have been talking to her everyday and she isn’t in too much pain. But it still hurts me to see her like this.

She had a catastrophic stroke while doing inpatient chemo and luckily we were with her the last 5 days.  I kind of took her role on and the family has been a roller coaster since then. 

Skip forward to this year - I did a 8k race the first weekend of March and much like the 5k in February, I had no go. No push. Finished but felt horrible and in the best shape of my life. My BFF said maybe you’re anemic and she was spot on. 
On Friday the Dr called with the results - no measurable immune system. I looked at the counts and knew it was MDS or something like that. I had a bone marrow biopsy and within 2 weeks was diagnosed with MDS-EB1. 

The genetics test came back and the cause of my disease is Dyskeratosis Congenita  ( https://www.dcoutreach.org/about-dc ) &amp;  a TERT gene mutation with short telomeres. My mom would have had the same to pass it on. She would be crushed to know this but it might have helped her attitude as 13.5 yrs ago when she was diagnosed. The theory was that she exposed herself to benzine and she blamed herself. 

No good statistics for anything and now my siblings are being tested for the same. This has to be completed before HLA matching.  The same gene also effects the lungs and liver so it will be monitored the rest of my life. If I survive the BMT, there’s a 40-50% chance of an issue free extended life. 
My ANC hit a high of 0.50 on Friday and I’m doing really good with the exception of fatigue, anemia and severe headaches. I also have an 8 cm blood clot in my inferior vena cava, so adding Eliquis sucks. The Palliative care team and Psychiatrist are great.  But I’ve been quarantined to my apt since March so I’ve resigned to resting and drinking fluids.

Tomorrow will be strange, going through all this has somehow reconciled her loss with me. My family looks at me like I’m her part 2. I won’t be overly emotional as in past years.  My family does not live close and understandably are having a hard time processing. There’s been one visit and the bad energy wiped me out. I’m not sure if/when I want another visit but will need that support post BMT for the 90-100 days of care post-hospitalization. Sigh. 
If you made it this far, thanks for listening. 

TL/DR: I got MDS from my mom and finding the inherited gene mutation cause helped me reconcile her passing 10 yrs ago. Not so much for the rest of the fam on this anniversary. I needed to write this out so I can move on to my fight.

She was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer in February of 2017.

She started off with mild bloating, constipation, and gradual weight loss. We initially wrote it off as “old age” and her physically demanding job at the grocery store. My mom hated doctors, hospitals, and had a phobia of needles so we never rushed to get anything checked out. 

When we finally convinced her to visit our GP, she underwent some diagnostic tests and they found that she was infected with H. pylori. The GP prescribed antibiotics and a PPI to get rid of the bacteria and stomach ulcer. The antibiotics caused some side effects and my mom began missing doses and didn’t want to take it. Weeks went by and her gastric symptoms worsened. We weren’t warned that H. pylori was a major risk factor in many stomach cancer cases in South Asians. We tried to get her to take her meds but I was never fully aware of how dangerous this bacteria was. One day, she began having intense abdominal pain and vomit that looked like it had coffee grounds in it (coagulated blood). We visited the ER for the unbearable pain and was admitted that day. We got referred to a specialist who did an endoscopy and we got our first delivery of nightmarish and shocking news – possible stomach cancer. I felt like throwing up knowing that my mom was about to go through hell.

For the first time, we visited the Cross Cancer Institute in our city and met with an oncologist. We began talking about timelines and outlook, which hit me like a ton of bricks. Based on my mom’s own choices, we skipped chemo and chose the surgery route that was offered. In April 2017, our general surgeon performed a cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC (hot chemo liquid filled into the peritoneum after resecting visible mets). She had a partial gastrectomy and colon resection as these were diseased areas. I remember how long the surgery felt and I slept over in the hospital overnight with my dad, both worried sick.

Throughout 2017 and 2018, we’ve seen our loved one get better, gain weight, and then gradually decline. She started being less and less able to eat because she felt fuller and fuller after meals. The next thing that came along was the bloating. It started off by happening after meals and it later became constant. So much so that she was almost always seen with a hot water bottle on her tummy. This bloating caused heartburn and she describes it as “the food not going down”. She has dilated loops of bowel where the food simply isn’t being moved along. We’ve seen all our doctors that kept recommending Restorlax or Lax-A-Day. It was so disheartening when her regimen of laxatives was almost equal to the amount of food she was able to eat. We sometimes don’t realize how important and how critical eating and basic functions are to physical and mental wellbeing. She was hungry, yet physically couldn’t eat enough to fulfill her hunger.

In Late May of 2018, we were visiting family in another city and was planning to drive back home the next day. She had very intense abdominal pain and constipation that resulted in us going to the ER far from home. She has been in the hospital ever since and finally got a surgery yesterday to try and relieve the bowel obstruction. The doctors opened her up and found matting of the colon, scar tissue, and cancer nodules throughout. They say all of the problems were caused by the first surgery and the cancer itself. None of this was present on the CT scans or PET scans they did prior. They weren’t able to relieve the obstruction due to the fear of nicking the colons or bowels and causing further issues. We’ve been talking to a palliative care team and helping her decide how she wants to be treated for her last few months. She just wants to be out of the hospital, valve and tube free, at home.

I’ve been lurking this subreddit for a long time but I’ve always had trouble speaking up. This disease has made me realize how important family is and how we never have as much time as we realize. I hope my message encourages someone to spend more time with their loved ones. We are all so vulnerable and anything can happen at any time.

I’m taking an unpaid leave of absence from work to spend as much time with her as possible. I’ve given up many opportunities at work but I know I will never regret the extra time I’ve spent with her. I’ve also made many family sacrifices and travelled away from home for my career. There’s no one that I love more than my mom and I just know I’ll be completely lost without my rock and support. She’s always been there for me and said that she’d rather live under a bridge with me than a big mansion without me. I’ve cried more in the past 2 days than I have in my past 20 years.",burntoasterbread,,10,2018-06-19 17:03:05,22,8saiea

Some legal advice please.,"Let me summarize briefly. We live in Canada. My mom has gastric cancer, late stage 3/early stage 4. Oncologist is recommending palliative care. That's not good enough for us. With current prognosis, she dies in ~13 months, maybe a little more. We've done a lot of research, got a lot of second opinions from some of the best specialists in the world. Our belief is that she still has a chance if we do FLOT chemo now instead of palliative, reduce the size of the tumor, then perform surgery to cut it out.

Oncologist is being difficult. He says that he will only prescribe FLOT if we have a surgeon agree to do the operation. The best we were able to do is get one to agree to do the operation if she is responding well to chemo and the tumor is decreased in size. It would be unreasonable to expect one to give a promise to do it even if she doesn't respond well to chemo, yet that seems to be exactly what the oncologist is demanding before he will sign off on the FLOT. 

Is there something we can do to force him to agree to give FLOT? He is reducing her chances of surviving this from extremely low to 0. We don't want to waste time by finding another oncologist who will agree to this. We've been trying to find some law that says a doctor can't deny treatment prescribed by another doctor through a second opinion, but so far no luck. If we must, we obviously will go looking for a different oncologist, even in a different country .... but it would be so much simpler and better if we do it here and now, in Canada were the gov't will pay for it.

My father is in great pain and its so frustrating for us that we are not able to help him anymore. I have heard about pain palliative care for cancer patients. It helps patient go though the pain somehow and provides mental support.

Has anyone tried this care method. I would like to get some feedback before we convince my father to try palliative care. We are also going to discuss  this with oncologist tomorrow. My dad is giving up on life and I am afraid things are going out of control so fast. 

Any information on this topic will be helpful.

Thank you and stay strong.

Liver cancer.,"Back in may 2017 my father was diagnosed with liver cancer. See I don't know much about it as my mom doesn't tell me when palliative care is coming in, and I wasn't there when he went to his doctor appointments. All I know is he is deteriorating quickly. Last year around this time, we thought that was it... We thought he had a couple days due to how quickly he went down hill, then he seemed to get better, but 1 year and a bit later he is back to the state he was in but worse.. It scares me seeing him like this, he can barely walk, he barely makes it to the washroom, he can barely hold himself up while sitting, he doesn't eat much.. It's just all happening so fast. 
Does anyone have any advice to help me as for how I could help him, and does anyone have any personal experience with liver cancer be it a loved one or yourself? What happens near the end... Signs... Stuff like that.. Easy ways to help cope.. I'm [21f] one of 4 daughters [20f/21f/28f/31f] I don't Think any of us know what we should do and how to help these emotions and our biggest worry is how soon the end is coming. 
My dad also has 4 grandchildren [8m,9m,4f,1f], is there anything we should do to help them, would you recommend them continuing to see him even with how he is looking/acting/deteriorating, should we maybe keep them away so they don't have any bad? Memories of how he looks and is acting?
Feel free to ask questions, I just want the best advice/help, and if more info is needed I'm more than willing to give It.",GreenieBabiee2,,3,2018-07-25 07:58:11,6,91pvn0

I'm wanting to withdraw....,"So my dad has been dealing with his cancer for about 2.5 years now. Terminal diagnosis was given January of 2018, he quit treatment once he found that out. So we weren't expecting him to live this long considering but I can tell now that he's starting to weaken quite a bit. He's about 95lb's and constantly in pain even with hospice and palliative care. My sister and I have been helping this whole time as much as we can. My dad is only 64 so we weren't really prepared (emotionally/financially) to handle this. My sister is in her early 40's and I'm only 27. But lately while I've been watching his health decrease (which I understand will happen), I'm finding myself almost backing away from him. Does that make me a bad person? Is this part of grieving? I still try and see him as much as I can when I'm not working but sometimes I get home from work and I'm like I don't really want to go see him. I feel like a terrible person. My sister and I have to take turns with meal prep and daily chores since my dad doesn't qualify yet through the state for an in home nurse because ""he can still go to the bathroom on his own, get around on his own"". He doesn't have enough money financially to enter a assisted living facility and with his terminal diagnosis, and we couldn't get him into low income housing due to his life expectancy and the waitlist being so long. So we are (like most I assume) the primary helpers. My sister makes me feel bad for not seeing him as much as her, she does it in a passive way and I know she's hurting just as much as I am, so I try and brush it off. But really am I being terrible? He's my dad and I'm so young and I'm dreading the day when ill get that call to rush to him...but why do I have this feeling of guilt when I have thoughts like this? Blessings to everyone going through similar situations. I completely understand now.

Australia, (F) 42.   It will be a long one... my apologies for the wall of text. 

I ended up being the end stage primary care giver to my best friend.  He was really unwell for years before hand, but as a 39 year old guy with clinical depression and severe anxiety, plus an addiction to prescription medication, it masked his symptoms and despite massive weight loss, difficulty eating and swallowing, delayed speech, full body pain for years, constant lethargy, soaking night sweats etc.. he wasn't diagnosed despite visiting his GP on a nearly fortnightly basis. 

Eventually, he lost his voice and the GP called it Laryngitis and gave him some antibiotics, but it never cleared up and a chest scan revealed a mass in between his lungs and heart, pressing up onto his vocal chords.

He was requested to attend a hospital for a needle biopsy and the nursing staff took one look at him and sent him straight down to emergency.

That was just under 3 weeks before he passed.  He was diagnosed with a non-specific cancer, and we were told it was pretty much right through his body by that stage and extremely aggressive. Multiple doctors all looked at his file and conferred that treatment was out of the question and he would be palliative care from this point on, with emphasis on continual pain relief and strong antibiotics in an attempt to extend his time to meet with friends and family.

The first night he was in emergency care receiving two blood transfusions to increase his strength, stabilise his fluctuating heartbeat and allow him to make it through an operation the following day to relieve the built up fluid collecting around his heart.  He made it through the first night, and the subsequent operation but was incredibly weak.

From then on, I stayed by his side in the hospital.   I watched over him through each night, ensured he was getting everything he needed during the day, made sure he was continuing to breathe while sleeping, that his drips were being changed, that he was comfortable, and managing all his visits, counsellors and communication with friends and family.

I barely slept, except for when he had other close friends or family nearby to keep an eye on him, and I got used to making a nest of the hard vinyl covered chairs to sit beside and watch him through the hours of darkness.  I ate his leftover hospital food and would sometimes beg the kitchen staff for the three pack Arnott's biscuits and a weak cup of tea.

He was allowed to leave the hospital with a care plan in place and spend a few days at home, seeing friends and family, but it was so draining for him.  He was scared, but also very honest and matter-of-fact about his situation, so he just kind of.. accepted everything with a shrug.

During his time at home, I had to administer his medications and keep track of all the activity with the assistance of a daily visit from a mobile nurse.  It was frightening.. I'm not medically trained and had no clue about hardcore prescription drugs, like a one litre bottle of morphine, fentanyl strips, plus about 8 other packets to keep track of on a rotating schedule.. as well as ensuring he had adequate thickened fluids and was kept clean and comfortable through the constant sweating and vomiting

He lasted in his home care situation for nearly a week before he went into his final coma and I had to organise an ambulance transport back to the palliative care wing.  I remember that ride vividly.  I sat holding his head still as the vehicle rocked around the corners, while parrotting all his personal details like date of birth, full legal name etc and the prescriptions that were all thrown into a big brown paper bag at my feet.

In palliative, after he was made comfortable, I arranged for the final visits of some people that needed to see him for closure, like his ex-girlfriend, but mostly, I just combed his hair, made sure he had music on his headphones and asked for a nurse to re-catherter him to relieve some of the pressure in his belly and then... just.. watched.   

I stayed with him through the night one last time and he passed the following day around noon with myself and his mum in the room.  He was in a deep morphine sleep and I like to think he was floating through bottomless, warm comfortable water.

Afterwards, I wrote and gave an eulogy which I barely remember, and had all the counselling.. There were a small number of his very special close friends that would check in on me daily, as well as his wonderful Father as I developed PTSD and my insomnia issues went into overdrive.  I started having insanely intense nightmares and flashbacks.  Found I was not able to get the sound of the IV pump out of my head.. the sucking noise and the rythmic click.  The smell of the floor cleaning solution from the morning janitorial staff..  so much more that I can't say even now.. it still hurts too much.

I didn't actually cry for nearly five months afterwards... it felt like a blockage... and then it was just a massive all-consuming breakdown... 

I guess through all my words, I want to give everyone going through this stuff right now, a big internet hug.. and to the carers, the friends, the family, yes, sometimes it doesn't always end the way we hope it will, but please, look after yourselves, put a strong support network in place beforehand and lean on it when you are going through the really hard parts.  Get counselling.  

Spend time with your best friends.. hug them too much.. have the weird conversations, the stupid chats, the fun days talking shit to each other and building memories that you will always remember, and just.. love them and be kind.

It's 3:45am here now, so I'm going to try and get a few hours of sleep now..  thanks in advance if even one person reads this x",humanbinchicken,,10,2018-08-03 17:47:55,18,94br9w

The outpouring of support was so unexpected and so overwhelming that I couldn't even begin to get back to all of you who reached out or offered sympathies. Sorry that I couldn't take time to acknowledge every one of you but just know I read every response and each one touched me very deeply and was genuinely appreciated.

However, I'm sad to share that my dad succumbed to his cancer very rapidly and passed on earlier this evening. He died at home in his own bed with my mom, my sister and her husband, and myself surrounding him. Considering how much pain and discomfort he's been in this last week, his passing seemed very peaceful. Two palliative nurses came to see him and while checking his vitals discovered that he had no pulse on his right side and was showing signs of organ failure. Realizing it was his time, they left us alone for our family to surround him and share in his final moments. He used his last breaths to ask if we would all he okay, and my mom told him we would always be looking after each other. After that, he nodded and slipped away quietly. 

I'm heartbroken and still feel angry of the robbed time, he was only 54, is just short of celebrating 30 years of marriage to my mom, and now he'll never get to be a grandpa or see me get married. It's not fair at all that this happened to him, to my family, but from the moment of his diagnosis this was really the best thing any of us could have hoped for. He knew there was no treatment, no chance at a normal pain-free life again. I'm happy he didn't have to linger in senseless suffering and I'm especially happy that he got to leave this world somewhat on his own terms...he hated the idea of withering away in a hospital, he even asked my mom a week ago if she would be okay with him dying in their bed...and he had so much love surrounding him in his final moments. Now I just feel so relieved I made it home in time to spend a couple days with him, I had no idea how close I was to possibly missing him. Apparently he said a few times before I arrived he was ready to die but everyone could tell he was just holding out for me to come home and I'm so glad I could be there for him.

All in all, I feel surprisingly peaceful and alright as of now but maybe it hasn't hit me that he's gone yet cause it's so new, maybe it will hit me later when something happens that I would normally text him about but then I realize he's not there. I know I'm going to miss him a lot, and I'll selfishly be wanting him around for all the milestones of my life that you would always just assume a father should be there for. It's heartbreaking and overwhelming, especially because a month ago we didn't even know about his tumours and from his diagnosis and onwards things just spiralled so fast. It's heartbreaking, but I'm happy he's no longer in pain and I'm also touched to see all the friends who's lives he impacted and the support that's come my way today and that my family and I have found in each other has been remarkable.",alana_erin_,,5,2018-08-17 06:03:48,32,97zu8e

What are people's experiences with this type of treatment? How much are the side effects likely to decrease quality of life? How much can the treatments do to ease pain as things progress? What will progression look like in either case?

/r/cancer/comments/9caoql/working_in_oncology/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9caoql/working_in_oncology/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Working in oncology,"Hey everyone. I am a med school student from Germany, hoping to be a doctor in six years. In German med school we are required to do 3 months of nurse work in our first few semesters, to get to know the work in medicine.

Right now I'm finishing my last month, which I am doing in an oncological station. I just wanted to tell you guys how strong and inspiring all of you are, no matter what you think of yourself. There are just so many life changing decisions you have to do on a daily basis. Most  of my patients are dying or going to die, as we are the last station before you are either cancer free, or going into a hospice or palliative care. And all of them know that. And just having the pure force of  will to get up and live your life, or do your exhausting therapy while having that in the back of your head is so incredible. 

Even more the happiness that many patients bring to the station. You just say f u to cancer and don't let it decide, how you feel. To be fair, most my patients are really old and have probably lived a great life, but still. Even the younger patients are like that.



I really don't know if this useful to any one of you, but I just needed to share. I often feel too young and inexperienced to deal with all the sadness and death, that are part of life on our station, but seing almost all the patients deal with that with such strength and grace really feels good. 

Or seing a patient consciously decide to end treatment and peacefully die with their loved ones is just such a special kind of sadness that I've never felt before. I don't think that it feels good, but I guess it kind of feel fair, that the person is the one making this decision, and taking that last one away from cancer. I don't know if that is gibberish, English isn't my first language, so explaining those deep feelings is really hard.

I really just needed to share my thoughts I think, as most my friends luckily were not exposed to death in that way, but as harsh as that sounds, I feel that opening up to you guys could be helpful. I'll be there for discussion or just talking, so feel free to share your thoughts please. ",MrZarazene,,4,2018-09-02 08:37:42,17,9caoql

I don’t know how to feel. Earlier I posted about my grandpa on the verge of death from metastatic cancer in his lungs. I thought the fight was over. I seriously thought that there was no hope for absolutely anything. I was so stressed that I would cry every night, and I’m still suffering from painful cystic acne (which I’ve NEVER had) because I’m pretty sure all of my hormones are messed up. That isn’t even the worst of it. My grandpa was getting night terrors. He would wake up in the middle of the night screaming because he thought he had died. The options for palliative care and comfort were all discussed, etc. my grandpa thought it was the end... we all did. He walked into the oncologists office and they told him the news. The “growth” in his lung was not really a tumor but some fungus growing. I know I should be happy but I honestly don’t know how to feel. One second I thought I was going to lose him and now I’m not? I don’t even believe this honestly... how does not one but many professionals who looked at his scans mess up like this? He’s still very sick from whatever fungus is making him super sick. He’s still depressed. I don’t even think he believes the news himself. I feel terrible for him. I don’t think he understands. I honestly don’t either. I’m posting this to update the nice beautiful people who wished me the best in my last post. I honestly didn’t think I was going to have to post about this. I’m having a really hard time grasping reality right now. I’m very thankful though. So so thankful. I wished that he would see me get into medical school and wear my white coat.

My dad had said he was a little unwell before we went away. Upon my return he told me they had found a 15 by 18cm mass in his liver, he had been losing weight since june, had some blood tests and a scan which revealed the mass. He was unable to eat very much or drink very much. He was awaiting a biopsy and a further scan. He collapsed and was taken in to hospital a couple of weeks ago, they had mentioned palliative care to him, at which point he seemed to give up hope and I was distraught. 

I talked to the nurses and they explained that this did not mean the end, that they refer to the palliative team for pain management, so when i explained this he perked up again and we felt a little more positive. He had an endoscopy whilst i was there with him which showed stomach and surrounding areas were clear. He had a further chest to knee scan which showed only the mass in his liver was present and a biopsy. He went home, and after a week they made an appointment to discuss next steps for the coming monday. 

He put the apppointment back a week, he said he was too weak to attend a busy hospital right after being released, and last week was also his 73rd birthday on Friday which I suspect was the real reason. 

We were holding out hope as it had not spread, but he called me from the appointment on Monday, and could not speak so his wife took the phone and explained to me they had told him it was too large to operate, they could not consider a transplant either and he has 2 months left or so. 

Today, 24 hours later his wife called and told me he was now in a hospice, so he could easier have medication and care, and althoigh weak and mostly sleeping that I should leave visiting for this coming Saturday as she wont be with him tomorrow she has to get her car seen to. I would have thought that could wait and she would be with him as much as possible, but this could br her way of coping I dont know. 

I might ignore her and get myself down there, but I dont know if I should. I cannot imagine what my Dad is going through. I do not know what to do, what to say to him, and i do not know if I am mentally strong enough to cope, and I feel guilty that I am thinking about myself and also telling my kids, and even guilty posting here when there are those so young suffering too, I am Sorry, and just fuck cancer, especially this apparently rare form he has in his liver.

This is already hard enough as it is and the alcohol just makes it so much harder. I've told him that I want him to be in his right mind as much as possible for the time he has left. I told him today that it's going to crank his emotions up to 11 and mess up his sleep.

There's so much I have to keep inside because of caring for other people in my life and remaining strong for them.

To me cancer has always been something you could usually blast away with machine gun kinds of medicine. In this day and age, what chance does breast cancer or testicular cancer stand? Of course there are people whose bodies lose the fight; I know that reality personally and statistically. But I thought it was the exception to the rule. I’ve also known that there are typical killers, like lung cancer or advanced ovarian cancer. But it turns out there’s so much I didn’t know.

We learned of my husband's cancer at the beginning of August and we finally got some answers last week after chasing a diagnosis for two whole months. We all know about breast cancer, but who the fuck knows going into their journey that there are 50-80 different kinds of sarcomas? Who knew about cancers like sarcomatoid carcinomas? Cancer of unknown primary? After two months of doctors, suggestion after suggestion, two biopsies and numerous tests, and a week-long hospital stay due to bleeding emergencies, my husband as gotten a diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary. In that short time his tumor has both grown and metastasized and we've learned there will be no clear diagnosis. My husband’s cancer is likely somehow connected to his first cancer from 18 years ago, but it’s mutated so much from whatever it was then that we might never know what it’s become.

Here we are now. We have three young children, and we have one hope for my husband: that the general chemotherapy he's beginning will shrink his tumor enough to allow surgery that would save his life, a surgery that one of the best surgeons in the world has so far refused to undertake. If the chemo won't shrink the tumor, his care will become palliative. The cancer will slowly take over his body and he will die, likely in the next year or so. We should know in the next 6-8 weeks whether or not his life will end this way.

So now we’re exhausted. It's been a hard two months. I’m carrying the family emotionally, and learning to take care of all the things my husband used to do -- tools, yard machines, replacing toilet seats, etc. Thanks to our kids, I can’t begin work. My husband needs a caretaker as well. Who else will take him to his appointments? We go to specialists in NYC. Four of the best cancer doctors in the world haven’t been able to give us answers, but we still must go there, because it’s the chance we have for a life together. The last time he went alone to his appointment in NYC, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, followed by a week of internal bleeding, and almost died. I must be available to him and the kids but at some point I’m going to have to support us all financially. I've been a stay at home mom for the past ten years.

We are fighting something we don’t understand. For us it’s as if cancer medicine is in its infancy. It has no answers for us.",HalloechenPoppoechen,,7,2018-10-07 15:06:48,17,9m5pax

About 6 weeks ago we found out there is not much more to do as her brain mets has spread too deep. Surgery is too risky and would likely paralyze her completely. Since then, her treatment has ended and she has been at home in palliative care up until two weeks ago when we transferred her to hospice. It became too difficult to care for her at home (she has very little function physically, and her husband has been incredibly difficult - trying to bar myself and two siblings from being with her in their room, yelling at us, etc.). As her health POA it was in her best interest to move her to neutral and peaceful ground in hospice care.

Which she hates. The staff and the hospice itself is wonderful, but for her it's not home. The transition for her has, of course, been difficult. The brain mets is all pushing on her frontal lobe, so there is a lot of anger and agitation my siblings and I take the brunt of (biting, screaming, sweating, etc). We totally understand and hate that this is how it has to be.

I'm at a loss, I don't know how to try and keep her somewhat happy (like who would be happy in this?). Going through photo albums and chatting about our day to day to try and stimulate her results in sadness and anger. I feel like all we do now is watch TV and eat her favourite foods together (she is on steroids for the brain mets and still has a decent appetite but even that is dwindling). Which is fine, but I feel like it's not enough and feel like a shitty daughter for not being able to make her happy - which I was very good at when she was more lucid.

I want to try and make her last moments as pleasant and loving as possible - but she gets so angry and agitated at everything I feel like nothing is working. They've given her sedatives and what not to even her out a bit but you can just see in her eyes how sad she is. I don't know what to do. For anyone who's gotten this far, thanks for taking the time to read. Any advice would be so appreciated.

I am needing some guidance on my mother's journey with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. 
I will start from the beginning and try to keep it as simple as I can.  She was diagnosed in early March 2017.  It was not in her lungs but in her thoracic lymphnodes, liver, spine and pelvis. She started chemo right away.  They started etopocide (sp) and carbo.  She only made it thru 3 1/2 treatments.  It made her to sick to continue.  She had a great response to it.  That lasted about 4 months before it started growing.  They put her on irinotecan.  She only did 2 infusions.  It made her very sick.. Diarrhea x100.  She was hospitalized at this point.  Took the wait and see approach.  January 2018 rolls around and again some growth.  Decided on immunutherapy this time. That didn't work.  Fast forward to March, tried Taxol.  She did 4 full treatments of it.  That ended in June.  She asked to take a break.  Ended up being hospitalized for about 5 weeks do to not being able to keep anything down and random fevers.  High fevers too. They did all kinds of tests and they couldn't find out why.  They finally concluded that it was just the cancer.   Palliative care was called in.  They put her on steroids and magically she could eat.  Well here we are  in October 2018 and the drs gave her 3 months being optimistic.  That was in August.  She just had scans and they showed tumors shrinking.  She hasnt had chemo since June 30th.   Has anyone experienced this?  This has been such a roller coaster.  I am her daughter and 1 of her caregivers.  Just looking for others experience. I obviously know this is terminal, but just seems like she is not the norm. Thanks everyone in advance",Cbux77,,1,2018-10-14 00:36:01,8,9nyqxw

She recently finished her chemotherapy for this but last month she found out that it had spread once again but this time to her brain.

She has had radiation therapy and is now having chemotherapy - she looks so poorly and is having many side effects; double vision, can barely walk, nose bleeds, tiredness etc. She has also now gone cross eyed.
The side effects are a lot worse than when she was having chemotherapy previously.

My mum will just not talk to me about it, she doesn't want me to worry but it's too late for that. I have tried asking her how bad it is but she just gets angry and refuses to answer which makes me think that it's very bad.

I also saw that on some of her paperwork she is having palliative treatment and that they are not trying to cure the cancer.
Work are being very supportive and it is a great distraction however I have been feeling very overwhelmed and keep thinking that she is going to die.
I know that all I can do is be there for her and be strong for her especially as she is so overwhelmed herself.

I am just finding it difficult that I do not know the full extent of her diagnosis and I would rather know if she didn't have much time left. 

Thank you if you read all of this, I just needed to get it out.

He is in a lot of pain and losing weight rapidly. This has all happened within 2 months. When we met with the oncologist, she spoke about palliative care and hospice. He is starting 5FU and Leucovorin and Herceptin because he is HER2 positive. The oncologist made no promises and did not sound overly confident or pessimistic. The infusion nurse, on the other hand, told my parents that the Herceptin is practically a miracle (maybe not that exact word but that impression nonetheless) and that he may now have years instead of weeks to months. I want to be excited and allow myself to relax a little, but at the same time, his doctors have given us the impression that things are going to go downhill from here and all we can do is try to slow the descent. Can anyone tell me if something similar to this has happened to you? Did you allow yourself to build up your hope? Also, does anyone have any experience with Herceptin for stage 4 esophageal CA? Lastly, the infusion nurse suggested that I get genetic testing to see if my chances of getting breast CA are elevated because of my Dad's diagnosis and HER2 positive results.

We just lost my mother in law who was practically my mother. I married into a middle Eastern family and being a guy from a small town in rural Eastern Texas was definitely an eye opening experience coming into a family like this. We've let my MIL live with us for the last 15 years.

6 years ago she started having problems going to the bathroom and started cramping. She went to the doctor and asked repeatedly for a CT or a colonoscopy but was rejected each time for a year because the doctor said it was just internal hemorrhoids. A year goes by and she's still having issues. Finally gets the CT and they find a mass the size of a grapefruit in her intestines and multiple tumors in her uterus. The doctor immediately signs her up for radiation and to start chemo.

A few months go by and they think there's a chance they can do surgery to remove it. The doctor goes in to remove it and opens her up and is horrified to find that because of the radiation, the tumor has fused itself to a bunch of arteries in her colon and also burned fistulas in her colon which in turn started to leak fecal matter into her body. More on that later. After the surgery we are told that her insurance will no longer support her because she and my FiL make too much money. She makes 600 a month from SSI and he makes 900 and it's their only source of income. They have to lie and tell the insurance company and the hospital that they are separated after 49 years of marriage so that way she can get state provided health care coverage. The hospital then puts in a few stents, a colostomy bag.

A year goes by and we find out about MD Anderson so we find out they'll cover her and start treatment. They were fantastic and started treating her right away. We tried multiple chemos and experimental treatments where she was like patient number 2 in the world to get these immunotherapy drugs. Everything failed. During all this time she's on antibiotics the entire time due to the fistulas leaking fecal matter into her body which they can't operate on because her intestines are like tissue paper. She's in and out of the hospital for a few years dealing with these infections.

So queue up October 15th. She is admitted to the hospital at 2am in the morning for abdominal cramping and she's unable to keep anything down. They CT her and find that she has an infection in her abdomen the size of a football that has compartmentalized itself so she didn't have chilling or fevers. It pushed her intestines and colon to the upper right side of her abdomen. They tried for 4 days to get the infection under control by using 5 different of the most powerful antibiotics they could use on her. On Thursday the 18th we got to the hospital and we're met with two docs in the room. The one standing in back said Palliative care on her jacket. I knew before she said a word how this was gonna go. She told us there's nothing more we can do and that we have to look into end of life care. We chose hospice and my MiL was coherent and made the decision to go to hospice. We were expecting her to live for 3 maybe 4 days and so were the doctors.

The first 3 days in hospice she was on heavy heavy morphine but she was still coherent and we said our goodbyes and cried and cried. It was very hard because she begged for food and water for 3 days but we couldn't give it to her because he stomach and intestines were already destroyed by the infection After 3 days she closed her eyes and didn't open them again. Because of her infection she had to be left cut open with just gauze over the open section. Day 6 the smells started setting in and filling the entire facility. It was the most traumatic thing I've ever experienced and she lasted a full 20 days with no food and water. I wouldn't wish this on anyone so please please if you suspect something get it checked out and then when you have a diagnosis get it checked again.",OptimusMatrix,,28,2018-11-06 14:44:46,70,9uovtx

Unfortunately, his oncologist recommended that he stop chemo and focus on palliative care. She said it as kindly and concisely as she could to a roomful of his loved ones (his mother, step-father, father, aunt and myself). 

It wasn't the news we were hoping to hear but, after conferring with the radialogist regarding his brain scan results, the oncologist said that there was no point in continuing chemo to treat the tumors in his other body parts when the cancer in his brain was not manageable. She said that he had days or weeks but not months. We all cried and hugged each other. 

The whole day was like a dream afterwards. The future I pictured for us was shattered. My fiance was kept for a few hours to get fluids into him because he was dehydrated and I drove us home after. Throughout it all he still refused to give up. Other than our initial cry session in the doctor's office he showed no other worry about the results. I asked him on the ride back home what his thoughts were and he insisted that he would still beat it. I didn't have the heart to do anything but agree and I still don't. 

Two days later we were packing up and heading to his father's beach house for some rest and relaxation. Two days after that it was decided that we would stay here from here on out and that I would receive some help with the caregiver duties (after his older brother walked an hour in my shoes when I had a particularly hard day involving several dirty adult diapers and called him for help). 

Now, he is snoring away in a hospital bed in his father's livingroom after a full day of festivities. However many days he has left I'm making it my mission for him to enjoy every single one. ",californiaflower27,,23,2018-11-23 05:11:13,87,9zlcri

I would like to ask you, all , what to expect, your experience, opinions on treatment, and what's ahead for my mom and what should I and family prepare for. She is 62, was diagnosed with stage IV couple weeks ago as initial diagnosis. Her results are, multiple MTSs in spine, 2 broken vertebrae, 2 more affected , MTSs on ribs. All other organs and bones are clean, except the right side LUs and the LUs near spine. So bone metastases only. Invasive lobural carcinoma, grade 2, HER2 negative, ER and PRO positive (100% and 90% strong reaction respectively). P53 negative, KI-67 below 20%.

She is in lot of pain from bone metastases, now using fentanil patches and flector/novalgen analgetics. Treatment: She had 1 phase (5days) of palliative radiotherapy for spine, we hope this helps with the pain. No more radiotherapy was suggested now and they said to wait 2-3 weeks for full effect. No chemo, but hormonal therapy with Letrozole. Denozumab or Ribocillib to be started next week.

Basically I would like to know, is this the right course of action, can I expect she will get better/pain free , and walk again as now she basically get up from bed only when absolutely needed. What is the normal time to get results of RT if it works and when is usually the check if the cancer is not progressing ? I know the hormonal therapy can take longer time for results. And of course , what are her real chances with above results ?

I’m going up to help them out this week, but I have a bad feeling that something is going to happen while I’m there.

He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2017 at the age of 47. He underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, got a colostomy, was operated on in feb2018 to remove the tennis ball sized tumour, and has subsequently been living with an ileostomy. Doctors were very happy with the treatment and surgery, he was a fucking champion throughout. All signs removed. I took for granted that it hadn't made its way into the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

His first round of post treatment check-ups and there are spots in his liver. I know that metastatic cancer is a different ballpark and it's fucking bothering me. I know all of the treatments hit harder than he expected but he grit his teeth and got through it, but he sounds understandably depressed, dejected and unsure of whether he can/wants to stomach more treatment. I know the liver is a shit one (aren't they all though, really). I know that we have to wait for more tests and this and that, and to see what treatments he can opt for etc. I know the university in this city has a strong medical research in other illnesses so perhaps there is hope there.

But above all else I know this is a numbers game and the odds of him getting out of the woods are shit. I know that the number of variables that we have to rely on lining up in his favour are out-fucking-standing. I know that realistically this is going to be a palliative rather than curative situation.

He's only 48 years old. Never smoked, not a drinker. Fit and strong as an ox. I thought we were done with this shit, I thought he was fine. I totally took it for granted. Surgery was successful it's all over. I know. I'll be strong for him, I'll hype him up and help him out. Im just fucking devastated. I don't want to lose my dad I'm fucking 24 and he is the biggest inspiration I've ever had. He inspired me to turn my life around, and I want him to see me graduate.

He was hopeful about having his ileostomy removed as the colon was successfully patched up and nervous tissue was still there. Maybe if the doctors had taken it seriously these liver spots could have been seen earlier in scans for the ileostomy reversal. Then again, that's the least of his problems right now.

I’m in shock I think? 

I got a call from him. I was surprised. He was getting an operation to remove a cancerous lymph node in his neck, along with  some muscle and a few  other nodes just in case, as he put it. I wondered if I had gotten the surgery time wrong- I live in the US and he in the Uk. How would he be able to talk right now? Stupid me thought, “wow, it must have gone really well! He must be super hopped up on pain meds!”


“Hi, so, um,  not good news I’m afraid. Surgery cancelled. It’s inoperable. They looked at the scans again and it’s wrapped around the (artery? Nerve? Idk).

So he’s on palliative care now. Boom. Just like that. From  scary surgery to once and for all rid him of this beast, to no hope. 

He discovered he had a tumor on his vocal cord June 2018. He got radiation, 35 sessions of hell in those awful constricting masks, plus chemo. He lost the ability to eat or drink and still can’t, because his esophagus is all fucked up from disuse and radiation. There was hope to fix that but now, with palliative chemo, they wouldn’t be able to operate. He still has his voice. We were so  scared he’d lose it.

But even though there is no sign of it in the original place, he had a rapidly growing lump in his neck. So they biopsied that, cancer. He was scheduled for surgery a few weeks later so he’d have  a slot. Had a scan to make sure last week that it was operable and we all held our breath....and they gave the all-clear...and now here we are. 


I’m in shock, I’m thinking about... everything. And rushing my passport because of course I fucking managed to lose it. 

How can they just decide to cancel the day of?? How can they say it’s all good one day and 5 days later do this?? They said it was too risky. I’m not angry at them. This is just so fucking unfair.

I hope for a cure everyday. I know it's too late for my mom, but I hope for one for every soul out there afflicted. My only true wish is that I see the fatality of cancer erased in my own lifetime.

I know she wont read this. And I know she's tecbinally only my step-mom but damn she's cared for me in so many ways. I love her as anyone would love their mom and she'll always be a mom, not a step-mom, to me. ",klsdgreen17,,5,2019-01-31 07:00:23,40,almwok

My father is seemingly in a much more grave situation and I don’t want to watch him suffer for a long time. I just want him to begin palliative care and not prolong his life unnecessarily. He wants to go through immune therapy to fight to live longer but he probably doesn’t have more than 6 months. I have to respect his wishes, however I still struggle to accept his decision.
Grieving my mom and at the same time losing my father, and going through this situation all over again is really quite a lot, and most days, I’m not sure how I’m going to get through this. 

Update: my father has transitioned to hospice care. He’s behaving very similarly to how my mom was behaving in her final days. It’s beginning to be very difficult for me to be here on my own watching him pass away. I’ve been much closer to my dad than my mom in the recent years and this has become particularly painful for me to witness. We used to have riveting conversations that would go late into the night. We’ve always been able to talk like this.

They caught it at Stage IV and her prognosis is 2-6 months. She's undergoing palliative chemo and nobody knows she's dying except me.

&amp;#x200B;

She's only 50 and I'm in my late 20s, but no other adult in my family speaks English fluently enough to navigate this mess. She nods when the oncologist uses a translator to tell her about her health, but she still thinks that curative surgery is the end goal. Dad is also under the impression that they'll reevaluate her for curative surgery after the chemo. You can't cure this type of cancer and my family hasn't figured that out yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm okay with taking care of my mom, but she is also the reason why I had an abusive childhood and spent the last 4 years in therapy. Mom has always made it clear that I was a mistake and regrets having me. She was a young mother and didn't know how to handle herself, much less a child. I've been taking care of myself since I was 9 years old, and at 13, I was taking care of her second child. I bailed from the household as soon as I was able to and have had minimal contact with the family since. Now I see them every week.

&amp;#x200B;

Dad has never had to parent a day of his life and doesn't speak a lick of English. He's told mom that if she panics, he will panic harder. When mom passes, I'll have to manage the household bills and paperwork. There will be houses and bank accounts in my name and I don't want any of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The only other family member I have is a 14 year old sister. She speaks English and suffers from teenage depression. She knows mom has cancer, but she doesn't know how dire the situation is. She had a much better childhood than I did (second time's the charm), so mom is her friend. It'd break her heart to know that mom's dying.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only been 5 weeks since the start of her treatment, but all of the paperwork, phone calls, and making decisions on my mom's behalf has been exhausting. I need to keep her alive for as long as possible for my sister's sake. I need to put on a brave face so the rest of the family still has hope. When she passes, I will inherit a family that I had previously intentionally cut ties with.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a support group last week for caretakers and everyone had stories about how much they loved the person they were taking care of. I feel guilty for not feeling love. All I feel is responsibility. What is wrong with me?",DeepInitiative,,7,2019-03-13 16:27:59,23,b0nywa

Last night he got lost on the way home from his doctors appointment, pulled into an alley and passed out in his car with a dead phone. Luckily a good Samaritan found him and got him to a hotel and we finally could reach him this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother, 66, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in October of 2014. She sought palliative treatment and it has been relatively successful -- she's still here after nearly fives years. Lots of ups and downs during that time. Main thing is her personality changed drastically when she was diagnosed. She was a very kind, compassionate, loving mother. With the diagnosis brought extreme depression, anger, bitterness (towards her husband, our father, especially). And most importantly, she essentially gave up on living life.

&amp;#x200B;

She has steadily declined in health and her reaction has steadily gotten worse. Aside from medical treatment, she has refused all other forms of help. Hospice ""is where they take away all of your choices and pump you full of drugs to die."" In-home care is a non-starter (I DON'T WANT A STRANGER IN MY HOUSE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO). any kind of mental healthcare is out of the question (""What the hell does some 20-year-old therapist know about death?""). ""I can do it on my OWN!"" is the same response we've gotten for five years. God help you if you discuss any of this behavior with her medical team. That has led to some monstrous, ugly fights about ""going behind her back"" and ""trying to get her into hospice against her will"".

&amp;#x200B;

This attitude has caused no end to problems and grief for her and us, leading to things like a broken hip (""I DON'T NEED A WALKER!), among other serious and less serious issues. She goes through periods of general good health and then periods of being bedridden. The latter is what we're going through this weekend. She now has incontinence issues and absolutely refuses to get out of the bed so we can change her sheets. The reason? ""I CAN DO IT MYSELF"" ""WHAT'S THE POINT I'M JUST GOING TO WET IT AGAIN"", etc.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just the same attitude we've put up with all along, but now it's a hygiene issue for her and us. I understand we probably should never have let it get to this point, but she's been so f\*cking hard-headed for five years that every appeal to reason and emotion ends with a screaming match about why we won't just let her die on her own terms (in this case, lying in her own filth).

&amp;#x200B;

I live out of state. My sister and father live at home and have been the primary caregivers. They're at their wits end because every attempt to aid mom in any basic way is seen as interfering in her life choice to die in the worst way possible. Sometimes getting her to eat a piece of toast is a battle of will lasting hours. Her actions and motivations are irrational, but she is technically mentally there, so we can't commit her or get power of attorney. We're stuck with this terrible person who doesn't at all resemble the caring, loving woman we grew up with. We know she's in there, which is why we haven't given up on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find any advice anywhere on how to deal with a patient absolutely refuses even the most basic kind of help. It's against all reason that someone would hold onto life this long only to ensure that she lives it in the most uncomfortable, lonely, painful, and isolated way possible. Has anyone else been through something like this? Do you have any general advice on where to seek help? Can anyone offer advice about how to just get her out of bed so we can change the sheets without forcing her out?

&amp;#x200B;

We made a decision to not tell him his diagnosis and that it’s terminal. So far he has had only minor issues with appetite but other than that no symptoms, no pain. Our doctors told us we should just let him live out his days normally: working, doing science, gardening. I’m so lost. He seems fine and happy, glad to not have any tubes and he actually enjoys the drip and the plasma procedure. He believes he is getting better. 
I just don’t want to believe it’s happening. Sorry for the rant, needed to vent somewhere.

I am not my disease to be conquered.

I will come for chemo when I am feeling symptoms and if it’s too late, that will be the risk I and I alone take.

I move to California to try and make it to MAID (medical aid in dying). 

My lung surgeon said she doesn’t thjnk anythjng is imminent but I can’t be operated on again while still recovering plus she thinks it would do more harm then good. I’m out of systemic options according to my medical onco, inoperable according to my surgeon and they won’t do any more SBRT according to my radiation onco. My performance status and prognosis prohibit me from most clinical trials. I truly have no more options to fight it.

If i can hang around a national organization may do a feature on me as I’ve lead quite the unique and interesting life. I may head to try and live a dream and do a little bit of awareness raising for sarcoma and MAID on my way out.

So what happened was that my dad had a lung nodule which we had been tracking for 3 years. It was suspected malignant last October after it started growing. However no surgical/biopsy could be done as he has a weak heart and had collapsed once before, and anything invasive is high risk. Hence a wait and see approach was adopted. 

Fast forward to now and his recent CT scan showed that it had spread to the lymph node and bones all within a couple of months. This is absolutely devastating for us and chemo is out due to his heart. The only lifeline we have now is immunotherapy which comes at a very expensive cost. We are still considering this option but am willing to give this a shot as theres been encouraging stories of tumour control. 

I just feel very overwhelmed as i am pregnant and due in 3 months. I pray everyday that he will see his grandaughter. In the meantime he is being admitted to palliative rehab so that we can strengthen him before moving him back home for hospice care. Another issue is that he stays alone and so we'd need to get my sister to move in and watch over him.

I need help processing,"Like the title says, my mom died last week at the age of 54 of metastatic breast cancer. She was diagnosed about a year ago in a routine mammogram and at the time told me that her doctor couldn't assign a stage to it (which I thought was weird but she said it was just a tumor in her breast and her prognosis was good, needed chemo then a mastectomy). We live far apart right now but we are close and speak almost every day - and I saw her every few months. She's not someone who wanted people talking to her all the time about cancer- she waited several months after diagnosis to tell other family and friends. I tried to strike a balance between checking in on that specifically and having normal conversations. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed to me she hit every roadblock imaginable on her cancer journey- she lost TONS of weight, surgery got delayed and delayed and delayed. We were all worried about her, and after some encouraging she got a second opinion at MD Anderson about 6 months ago but decided to stick with her oncologist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then she seemed to start feeling worse. I thought it was due to a year of nonstop chemo but that surgery would be very soon. But then she got pneumonia about a month ago. She was hospitalized for about a week and then released. That was a turning point- she seemed diminished after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

She had chemo two Fridays ago. Then, the next night, she woke up and started yelling 'help me' and my dad's name. She couldn't tell he was holding her- she was delirious. He rushed her to the emergency room, where she had to be sedated. She had gone into multisystem organ failure. Scans at the ER showed the cancer had spread to her bones, lungs, brain and liver. She was put on a ventilator in a hope to help with something, but the doctors then advised that it wasn't survivable, and recommended turning the ventilator off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got on a plane and rushed to be there. I told her I loved her and held her hand while they ended life support. It all happened so fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then my dad found the medical records with her original diagnosis, hidden in their closet. She was diagnosed at stage 4. It had already spread from her breast to her lymph nodes, bones and liver at the time she was diagnosed. My dad didn't even know the extent of it- she had been very private about her appointments so he let her decide where he went with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if she just kept the gravity of the situation from us because she wanted to be treated as normal as possible, or if she was deeply in denial or what. There were notes from her doctors that they were concerned she wasn't processing the diagnosis. But my mom and I had planned the whole time that I would take a month off of work and come stay when she got her mastectomy, partially to spend time together and partially so I could help her and my dad. She seemed to be looking forward to that- I of course would have been there at any time if I knew it was stage four and there might never be surgery. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad demanded to go to her last chemo appointment with her, because he had gotten really worried about her- she was super weak. Her doctor apparently brought up to her for the first time that they at some point might need to change their focus to palliative care, but that they'd see how this new chemo went for a while. She said she didn't want to give up and didn't want to die. But she was dead, 48 hours later. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of the devastation that I'll never talk to her again- which I can't even start to comprehend yet- it is agony thinking about what she must have been through. It's pretty clear she suffered. But was she afraid? Did she worry we'd find out about the truth and be mad at her? Did she understand how serious this was, or was she in a sort of blissful denial?

I have been constantly asking his palliative team to increase his fentanyl and give him some meds to calm him down. But nothing seems to be working. They are taking the conservative approach and increasing the dose gradually. We have also requested for sedatives but he cant sleep at night and attacks the nurses.

Therapeutic radiation and (chemotherapy) can increase sun sensitivity-like how certain medications can.  I'm going to talk specifically about therapeutic radiation to treat cancer and what can happen to your skin as a side effect. 

I thought I'd try and offer some explanation as to the why, the how, advice, and a general PSA since this deals directly with skincare awareness-especially if you are currently going through cancer treatments. 

I'm sure those of you who've already undergone  treatments can offer your own personal insights, should you choose to. I'd love to hear any tips that I could pass on to current and future patients as far as the reality, and what to expect after  treatments are done.

I'd especially love to hear from women who have gone through the trifecta of breast cancer treatments (surgery, chemo, radiation).  What helped you most during and after treatments? How is your skin? Recommendations are most welcome. We typically give patients Aquaphor samples to use if/when skin becomes irritated, when it moves into the moist desquamation territory, Silvadene is usually prescribed. As far as I know, there isn't any cream that will fully prevent damage. One Rad Onc did have some information on an older cortico? steroid cream, but I'll be damned if I can remember the name. He was hesitant to commit to the phrase ""it could prevent"" so, by all means, ask your doctor. 

Please read the information at this link. It's very, very helpful. [Breast Cancer and skin care ](https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation/skin/care)

-How/What/Why-

Therapeutic radiation, depending on many factors such as target, max dose prescribed, dose distribution, which kind of particulate radiation used (photon, electron, proton), treatment field size, skin folds, depth of dose, if a beam modifier is used over the field (one example is brass mesh to draw the radiation up to the skins surface during treatment. They are often used on patients who've undergone a mastectomy. The brass layer will increase the tanning/burning since we're focusing treatment on the scar, the surface, and chest wall). 

- Other Factors-

Diagnosis, stage, and the safest way to treat your cancer while minimizing damage to healthy tissues, how many treatments the you have  undergone (the more radiation you accumulate, the more you will start feeling side effects), individual tolerance and skin sensitivity all play into response. Side effects continue weeks after you are done with treatment. 

-Skin- 

Treatments can potentially cause a range of skin damage from mild erythema (sunburn) to itching, tanning, blistering, skin breakdown, bleeding, moist desquamation etc.

If the skin breakdown is too severe patients are put on a break from treatment to let their skin heal before resuming.  They are typically prescribed silvadene cream by this time. This is frequently seen in head and neck, and breast cancer patients,. 

-More Why/Explanation-

As patients progress further into their treatments, they accumulate more radiation. Every treatment delivers a fraction of the total dose. This is the end achieved total dose prescribed from the beginning. Radiation is cumulative so patients typically don't feel any kind of side effect until week 2 or 3. Again, this depends on what we are treating. Palliative dose is prescribed to alleviate pain and or to slow growth such as multiple brain metastasis and cancer thst has invaded bone, especially spine. We want to slow and relieve cord compression as much as possible. 

I digress.. Your prescription is very specific to your disease and how soon it's diagnosed,and what treatments ultimate goal is. 

On average, depending on what kind of cancer you have and where it is located, full courses can range from a total dose of 3000( palliative bone and or whole brain, sometimes whole brain is done as a prophylactic measure) to approx 7000 cGy (prostate is a prime example of the long course) . This takes weeks to months of daily fractionated treatments to achieve, usually 5 days a week. 


-Skin 2-

Previously sunburned /typically exposed skin is already at risk of extra tanning/burning from the radiation. Think decolletage. 

It's especially important to keep your treatment area shielded from the sun during and after treatments. 

Your treatment area will sometimes stay tan and is even more susceptible to sunburn after you've completed your therapeutic course of radiation. 

Some patients don't realize that they are now more at risk of sunburn, where their treatment site was, than before. 

Permanent tanning of the site is possible. It is very individual. Some people tolerate the skin irritation side effects of treatment better than others.

-PSA-

Attempts to put sunblock on before your treatment does not prevent you from getting radiation induced erythema. That is solar radiation. Therapeutic radiation uses photon, electron and proton particle radiation. This is not going to be blocked by lotion. 

I only mention this because some people have attempted or inquired about it, and doing so would actually causes more skin irritation-since you have added another layer over your tissue and, unless we are specifically using brass, or another other bolus, is creating unnecessary skin irritation with.  Just wear a hat and scarf if you are going to be outside.  Use creams after your treatment. 

-Endnotes-

No one escapes the fatigue. 
You are braver than you think. 
Treatments are constantly evolving to minimize damage to healthy tissues, and with immunotherapy, better chemo drugs,  new ways to attempt treatment, or to just alleviate pain from your cancer, and curbing some of the nasty side effects from treatments...there is hope. 

People are out there in the world working tirelessly to figure out better ways to treat cancer, and to do it in ways that are easier for people to tolerate.

Earlier this month, she was hospitalized, diagnosis came back 2 weeks later with Triple negative breast cancer and peritoneum carcinomatosis; induced malignant ascites and high tumor markers... Dr's a lil bit worried she might not be responsive to chemotherapy. 
Her current chemotherapy regime is taxol + gemzar.

I have some questions... 

Is it possible for cancer to be treatable with target chemotherapy (herceptin) and then kind of mutate to be TNBC? 

Is it true that in case of TNBC that treatment options arent many and  hefty? 

Is peritoneum carcinomatosis a death sentence? I've read it has a high mortality rate, and there's little that palliative chemotherapy can do.. 

Note that she has taken two sessions of chemotherapy till now.

I am 21 years old and just started my senior year at North Carolina State University. My dad (58) was diagnosed with esophageal cancer almost 2 years ago in December of 2017. Our family had a great plan to do radiation and chemo at Duke in January of 2018 and then have an esophagectomy to remove the main tumor and basically cure him. One of the worst days of my life was that day of surgery, May 9th, 2018. The Dr's found mets that had spread to the peritoneum area and it was confirmed that it was stage 4. The worst thing was that they didn't show up on any scans so it was very shocking to have a false sense of hope about curing the cancer from the beginning. They stopped the surgery and woke him up. Telling my dad that the surgery couldn't be completed because they found it spread was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. He was still loopy from the medicine and it was terrible breaking the news to him like this. After that, we resumed more chemo and immunotherapy treatment (Keytruda I think). And we got referred to MD Anderson in Houston, TX. He got put on a clinical trial there and he had a couple of HIPEC procedures there. The rest of 2018 were good results, nothing growing on scans or anything so it was great. Then a surgeon agreed to do a full gastrectomy in January of 2019. The mets were still in his peritoneum but MD Anderson thought this would be the best route to extend his life and give him the best option. The surgery was a success but we knew it would change the way he could eat the rest of his life. A couple of months went by and we started treatment back up again. He started having these cramps and couldn't eat the portions that he used to. Then in July, we went to Houston for another scan and it seemed fine. About 2 weeks after that, he had some constipation so we got another scan. This was where reality came in. We found that he had a bowel obstruction of his small intestine and it was inoperable due to the stage of the cancer. It was very grim. We then knew it was terminal. I had to finish up an internship in Atlanta which was really hard because I knew my dad wanted me to finish it strong and not quit but I had anxiety about him dying and me wanting to spend time with him. We had palliative care come and give him fluids 3 times a week because he eventually could barely eat anything as he just threw it up and caused immense pain. The good thing is that I cut my internship a week early and went home and had great family time. Conversations that I will remember for the rest of my life. My dad was so influential and touched so many lives it's so hard to come to terms with this. His dad passed away from cancer when he was 9 so I feel like I learned so many lessons from him and how he overcame that. It's over now and we did everything we possibly could to prolong his life and fight that disease. my mom has recorded some of his motivational ""lectures"" the past year or so. We just listened to one and he said that he'd almost rather die on the operating table than to have us see him suffer in hospice. It breaks my heart hearing that now because he worked so hard to create only good memories for his children. #FuckCancer",Ccharlie12,,6,2019-08-25 14:01:39,12,cv8ujt
/r/cancer/comments/cvg0ww/gastric_cancer_36muk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/cvg0ww/gastric_cancer_36muk/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Gastric Cancer (36/M/UK),"This is more of a blog post about my cancer journey but there is a TLDR towards the end and I’d really like to hear from other gastric cancer patients about their journeys and the type of treatment they received.

So, around this time last year, I started getting some strange digestion issues. I was burping a lot more than normal and when I hadn’t eaten or drank anything that might cause them. I’d recently started making my own kombucha and thought that might have affected my gut flora so didn’t think too much of it. Until about a month later, the burps became notably more pungent, sulphurous in both taste and smell. This is the point I first went to visit a doctor.

They thought it was something digestion related, gave me a 30 day course of omeprazole and told me to come back if that didn’t fix it.

Towards the end of those 30 days, however, my appendix burst and I was rushed in for an emergency appendectomy and thus a spanner was thrown in the works: for the next two months, any new symptoms would be attributed to the surgery.

Starting with the first new symptom, pain in my left shoulder. I was told to expect this post surgery as they inflate your abdomen and this causes some referred pain to your shoulder. But it just didn’t go away. It felt like toothache but in my shoulder, if that makes any sense. At the time, I was going to wrestling training 3 days a week, plus 3 days a week in the gym. Despite any protests I might make that it didn’t hurt more when I worked out, the pain was put down to an injury.

Meanwhile, the burps have continued and now I have a new symptom - I sometimes have difficulty swallowing food. I think this is around the time my doctor started taking me a bit more seriously but still thought it might a stomach ulcer...

The only thing that helps with the pain is ibuprofen but now every time I speak to my doctor or any of the surgeons she refers me to, I’m told that the most likely cause is a shoulder injury that I started taking ibuprofen for and in turn, the ibuprofen caused a stomach ulcer. The logic seems sound, tbh.

By mid-January, the pain is now so intense I’ve had to give up training. Probably for the best because as soon as they hear you’re a wrestler in surgical assessment, they start treating you like a junkie. The pain also starts affecting my sleep so much I have to give up work too.

Which is probably a good thing because I’m now so anaemic, I’ve gone from six workouts a week to getting out of breath on the 5 minute walk to the nearest shop. I describe walking anywhere as feeling like high altitude training, not that I’ve ever trained at a high altitude.

By the end of January, I’m really having trouble swallowing but that doesn’t really matter, I have no appetite anyway. They book me in for an endoscopy to find out what’s going on.

The endoscopy is one of the most physically invasive things I’ve ever experienced but they do find a growth and it’s not a stomach ulcer. They think it’s cancer but they take a biopsy to confirm and send me for a CT scan.

A week later I get the biopsy results that confirm it’s cancer and the scan results that show it’s already spread from my stomach to my spleen, pancreas and lymph nodes. The pain was the tumour pressing against my spine and causing nerve pain.

From the first sign of symptoms to diagnosis took 5 months.

I get referred to my local cancer centre and during my initial assessment whilst discussing fertility, they drop the bombshell of my prognosis; average life expectancy of 18 months, only 4% make it to the 5 year mark.

They now tell me they’re not trying to cure me. All treatment from here on out is palliative.

This is undoubtedly hereditary. My father died of the same cancer, at the same age. My oncologist tells me I must be predisposed as I’m too young for it to be environment or lifestyle related. I go for genetic assessment. They tell me that most hereditary gastric cancer is caused by an alteration in the CDH-1 gene. This normally presents as a diffuse cancer, cell mutations over the whole organ, not a tumour mass like I have. But that doesn’t mean it’s not that. They also tell me it might be Lynch Syndrome, which does present as a tumour but tends to affect the bowel. They say there’s a number or other things it might also be so they’d test for the two most likely reasons and then fall back on the others.

I come back as negative for everything but they did find one gene alteration “of unknown significance”. They’re now going to test my biopsy tissue for the same alteration to try and confirm. It appears that this could show the start of new line in hereditary gastric cancer and I’ve found a clinical trial to join for this to be investigated further.

Tests show that I’m HER2 positive, something more common in breast cancer but a sign that the growth factor is more aggressive.

They start me on oxiplatin and herceptin infusions every three weeks with the first one landing 4 days before my 36th birthday. The infusions are followed up by capecitabine taken orally. I don’t know if this treatment plan has a fancy acronym like folfox.

After two cycles I feel completely normal. No pain, no digestion issues. 

After four cycles, they send me for another CT scan which shows a reduction in the size of all tumours. Pretty bored by now, I return to work but based from home to shield my compromised immune system.

After six cycles, I’ve finished with active chemo but the herceptin infusions will continue every three weeks. I’m feeling good and my oncologist describes my condition as partial remission; I still have cancer but I don’t have any symptoms.

I return to wrestling training; my cardio conditioning and stamina have practically vanished but I’ve retained, at least through muscle memory, most of my wrestling ability.

They send me for another CT scan to confirm the apparent result of the treatment but instead it shows that although the tumours on my lymph nodes have gone the way of my cardio and all but disappeared, the main tumour in my stomach might have started to grow.

They bring my next scan forwards by four weeks and it will now be at the start of September. 

The burps return. I try to ignore them. I focus on work and training. My cardio isn’t improving very quickly, if at all, but the endorphins from the physical endurance do wonders to keep my spirits up.

I don’t fully buy into all of the hype around cannabis oil but with some symptoms returning, I manage to source some and start taking it daily. I find the psychoactive effects overwhelming so I can only take it at night when I can sleep through the high.

However, despite trying that, this past Monday the pain in my shoulder came back. This time accompanied by a new pain around my lower ribs. It quickly progressed to being very uncomfortable and I end up in hospital on Wednesday getting a barrage of tests done; they can’t find anything new wrong with me. So it’s likely a return of the original cancer symptoms.

TLDR: A history of my symptoms and diagnosis process. Also, my symptoms have come back very quickly after ceasing treatment (around two months). 

If you’ve been treated in a different region than the UK, how has your treatment differed? Is there anything you would recommend me trying or asking for? I’m already waiting on an appointment for a second opinion at a hospital in London but I’d be interested in hearing from people with a similar diagnosis.",konamikode,,2,2019-08-25 23:32:00,13,cvg0ww

I’m here seeking some guidance from those of you who have unfortunately lost their loved one due to cancer. 

I have lived with and been the caretaker of my mom since she was diagnosed almost exactly 2 years ago with Multiple Myeloma (at 52). 

She underwent a bone marrow transplant (auto) last year which did next to null for the progression of her cancer. 
Two full years of nonstop chemo and radiation. She had 2 very painful, challenging, and exhausting years. There were many, many good moments mixed in there too. As a family we really pulled together to be here for her. 

A month ago everything took a tragic turn for the worst. She has now moved in with her sister and the doctors told us that stopping treatment is the best option. We are now focused on palliative care to keep her remaining days comfortable as possible and at home with her family. 

I am having a hard time coping. Living with my mom for the last two years brought us so much closer and now she’s being ripped away from me at a time when we have our strongest bond yet. I’m 25 and not emotionally prepared for the next few weeks. This is my mom. I don’t know life without her. How will I overcome this pain? How can I tell her how much she means to me while I still can? How do I get through my life without my mom? There’s so much I want her to be here for, my life is just starting. I want my mom to be a part of it. 

I know this may sound selfish but I am just scared and not sure how to communicate my thoughts very well right now. No amount of time could have prepared me for this.",workswimplay,,5,2019-09-06 19:41:35,15,d0li3u

First of all I am genuinely proud of everyone in this subreddit for sharing their stories and trying to help one other! Thanks for that.The reason I am here, is because of my mother ( born in may 1951)

She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2014. She got radiotherapy, followed by (oral: tablets) chemotherapy. After reducing the tumor to a smaller size, she got an operation. During this process, the doctors saw an abnormality in her liver. She then got a second operation in which they also removed the (metastasized) tumor in her liver. So that was that, and they declared her to be ""cured"" from cancer.

Fast forward to 2017.

She got a heavy cough for almost a month, when we went to the doctors for her semi-annual controls, they diagnosed her with stage 4 colon cancer with metastasis in her left lung, and some small dots in her liver. The colon was clear of cancer.

The doctors said curing was not possible anymore, so they started the traject of palliative therapy.

* She first got 5-FU, it didn't help.
* Then she got irinotecan from 26/2/19 till end of may 2019. She reacted VERY heavily, lots of diarrhea. The CT-scans showed no significant difference. So the doctors said they wanted to try something different
* They tried Panitumumab. It's an EGFR- inhibitor and not regular chemo. She got intense rash on her face, but the first CT-scan (after 4 treatments) showed enormous differences. The tumor in her liver and lung shrunk significantly and we were all happy something finally seemed to work.

Up until they made a second CT-scan (again after 4 treatments with panitumumab). The tumor markers were higher in her blood and the tumor in her liver showed some growth (the lung is stable).  Here comes the reason why I'm here.

According to this second CT-scan the doctors told us that there is nothing left that they can do. They basically cancelled ALL future appointments and told us they won't make any new scans or do anything, unless my mom gets new complaints, like heavy pain. They will then ONLY help reducing the pain, but nothing more than that.

I think this is insane.

My mom is 68, she has a stable weight, is not underweight , nor super overweight (161 cm long and weighs around 72 kg), she can walk, she can talk, she can basically still do a lot of things. Yes she is tired faster than before and has bellyaches everyday. But from the outside you would not say that my mom is a stage 4 cancer patient.  I don't get how the doctors are giving up on her, while she is still so fit? I mean i understand she is not curable, but why don't they try something else?

She has rheumatoid arthritis, they can't treat her with immunotherapy. But I've searched the web and research articles and I've found out about combination therapy where they give an EGFR- inhibitor combined with chemo (like cetuximab + irinotecan; it happens to help with patients who are not responding to irinotecan alone). Or they could give her a VEFG-inhibitor like Bevacuzimab (in combination with chemotherapy).There is also a new study about metastasized colon cancer (BEACON STUDY (in Dutch) ([https://www.avl.nl/nieuwsberichten/2019/nieuwe-combitherapie-biedt-darmkankerpati%C3%ABnt-extra-behandelkeuze/](https://www.avl.nl/nieuwsberichten/2019/nieuwe-combitherapie-biedt-darmkankerpati%C3%ABnt-extra-behandelkeuze/)) done recently which resulted in a combination therapy of a BRAF-inhibitor and EGFR-inhibitor or a  BRAF-inhibitor, MEK-inhibitor and a EGFR-inhibitor. I'm wondering why don't they try something like that?

So now I have a phone-appointment with her doctor tomorrow. I really want to convince her in not giving up on treatment for my mom. All I could find is written above, so now I'm asking you guys. Do you know anything else (like therapy or something else), which I can discuss with and suggest to the doctor?  Are there any people who recognize themselves in this trajectory and found something else that helped them?

I feel so desperate and anxious at the same time. I really don't want to accept that this is the end of everything.

Thanks for reading this, and I wish you all the best!

&amp;#x200B;

* maybe it's good to tell that we live in the Netherlands and the BEACON study is done at the same hospital as my mom is/was receiving her treatments (that's why I also don't understand why they did not suggest giving her that treatment as a fourth option).",Knarson,,15,2019-10-07 12:49:28,5,deizk5

No treatments available. Need some help or advice on what to do next.,"Hi everyone. It really hurts to write this but we are in need of some help.

My 53 year old mom was diagnosed with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis about one month ago. We found out the cancer had spread to her lungs, sternum, and lymph nodes about a week ago. 

Her oncologist which we saw 2 weeks ago was not able to offer any treatments due to cirrhosis from her autoimmune disease.

Her palliative physician sent her to the emergency room and she got admitted to the hospital for 5 days last week because her bilirubin and liver function had drastically risen.

We were told she now has multi-focal blockages throughout her biliary tree secondary to the cancer and PSC and there is nothing they can do including ERCP or external drain. Endoscopy, interventional radiology, and surgery were all consulted.

She was discharged home on hospice and we were told she may only have a couple weeks left with us as her liver begins to fail. 

This came on suddenly and out of nowhere and we are devastated by the news. My mom has battled chronic diseases her whole life. She was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis at 18, ulcerative colitis at 40, and cirrhosis and portal hypertension secondary to her autoimmune hepatitis at 51. She underwent a total colectomy in April 2018 and TIPS in August 2018. Her health has been stable since the shunt was placed last year.

Due to the above diseases she had annual CT’s/MRI’s, ultrasounds every 3 months, and labs every 3 months. She had a small lesion in her liver that they have been watching for the past 2 years but that is all. Her labs up until late July when she developed severe abdominal pain were normal. Her labs and ultrasound in June were normal for the exception of biliary sludge which her hepatologist said he would just monitor.

This has been a whole lot of information to process in such a short amount of time. We are not ready to let her go and she is not ready to go.

She has been receiving care at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, Oregon but we are planning to seek a second opinion. I have narrowed down a few physicians in the area through the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation webpage and I am planning to make some phone calls first thing this morning. I am also planning to call MD Anderson.  Is this a good idea?

Are there any novel treatments for biliary blockages or cholangiocarcinoma that she would be a candidate for? I am not sure what her oncologists had considered. She will not be a candidate for any clinical trials. What has worked for pain control? This has been most difficult. She is currently on a fentanyl patch, using either hydrocodone or morphine for break through pain, and they are now considering methadone too.

Thank you everyone for your input and sorry for the long post.",juwiz,,16,2019-10-10 12:50:08,17,dfxjv3

My mom was diagnosed January 2017 with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her bones. She has a destroyed hip, femur fracture that healed on its own and several compressed disks. She literally shrunk like 7 inches from what she was years ago. Barely gets around with a cane/walker. She turned 55 this year. Her doctor told me that my mom must have known that she had cancer for a long time as the lump on her left breast/chest is large and visible from the outside. And obviously the bone pain was excruciating. That’s what ultimately brought her to the hospital. To make a long story short, fear of doctors and being consumed taking care of my addict brother led to her being diagnosed only after the disease had progressed that far that she couldn’t avoid it any longer. 

Side note: She was also diagnosed with cirrhosis in 2015. 

She did a few rounds of radiation and had a double mastectomy. They said she was too fragile to operate on any bone related issues. She started taking ibrance and letrozole. Ibrance made her blood counts tank so almost immediately they knocked her down to 75mg (lowest dose) one week on and one week off instead of the normal every two weeks. 

Long story short the blood counts just kept tanking. In the last 3 or 4 months we couldn’t  get them back up, so no more ibrance. She got a blood transfusion mid sept. She would never survive traditional chemo so the new plan is to have her start Faslodex next week in place of the letrozole. That’s it. 

My problem is my mom is rapidly declining and despite my attempts, no one is acknowledging this. She has lost 20lbs since that transfusion a month ago. Doesn’t eat. Sleeps the majority of the day. Every task is exhausting and she cannot do things (like her make up) that she could a month ago. Everything is difficult for her.  She can’t remember things and is confused by things in simple conversations. She looks awful. I have explained to the nurse and the doctor I don’t understand how we are not at the hospice point. The decline in the last month...even in the last 2...before all the blood transfusion stuff is sharp. They are all obviously very attached to her and an amazing team of doctors and nurses at a very reputable cancer center. Is it normal for them to continue to give hope until it’s undeniable that no meds will help? She seriously thinks she will get better. I’m not sure how a hormone Med will improve where we are at and her having it in her head that this is temporary makes her even more difficult to care for. She is a difficult patient. I am trying to enjoy our time together as I sleep on her couch several states away from where I live but it’s hard. It’s especially difficult when I don’t know what to expect and what the doctors are saying and what I am seeing in no way line up. I read a hospice nurses thoughts somewhere here on reddit that said “when the decline is week to week, you can expect days to weeks that may turn in to months”. This seems realistic to me. Is it? I finally convinced mom to see a palliative care doc (the paperwork makes it clear this is separate from hospice which is the only reason she will go). We go on Monday. Are they the ones expected to break this kind of news? Any thoughts appreciated. I don’t know how any of us can continue living like this.

UPDATE: my mom passed about 3 weeks after I wrote this. We went to that palliative care appt and the doc was like “there isn’t anything more that I can really do for you. Not sure why you’re here”. The decline after writing this continued rapidly. We checked in to the hospital on a Thursday and her onc finally saw her in the state she’s actually been in - checked in to hospice on a Sunday and she passed overnight the Tuesday after. Minutes after the clock struck midnight on my brother’s birthday. They’re together again. ❤️

To echo a sentiment that I found frequently in all my research as a caregiver - I wish we had started hospice sooner. The days we were at that stunning facility changed my life. What if we had spent her last months comfortable instead of struggling like we did? If you feel something in your heart like I did and you know you’re right - say something! And don’t stop saying it. Even if it is hard. I wish I had pushed everyone in charge of her care to use the words “hospice” sooner. I knew it was time and I was right. Don’t doubt yourself.",[deleted],,4,2019-10-10 22:16:08,2,dg5hn6

2 Christmases ago she announced that the cancer was back but it had spread to her ribs this time. They removed a rib shortly thereafter.  Today she started Keytruda and Inlynta because 4 months ago it came back in her ribs, hips, spine, and shoulders.

My sister literally raised me as much as my mother as her oldest child is 7 months younger than me. I'm losing my shit and my nephews are indifferent.

His last hospitalization had doctors starting to ask whether we started looking into hospice. Both my parents refused after the doctors clarified that chemo would no longer be an option  if he was in hospice. So they went with palliative. 

His first in home visit today went as expected; the doctor clarifying that the doctors were low key recommending hospice at this point. 

We were all confused, my dad especially. All his oncology visits, his doctors, care takers, it’s like they tip toed around telling us that we basically have to start considering end of life care now. 

Communication issues like these are why I wonder if we made the right choice keeping my dad at his current hospital. Part of me also wonders if it would have mattered, if this was a death sentence since the beginning anyway. 

My dad says he hates the idea of hospice because he feels like he’s going out without a fight. My mother still has hope that he can recover and continue treatment. 

I don’t know how to break this news to her, because I feel like deep, deep down, we’ve given up and have accepted what will come. I feel like a coward for it. To have to tell my mom that he has to go into hospice, and tip toe around the inevitable just like the doctors have done with us.

My dad is in the hospital, he has been admitted because he’s on palliative care and his time is near. He’s been on sodium chloride? And glucose since Sunday. 

Today we arrived at 2pm, his machine was bleeping as the bag is empty. I watched a nurse come over, turn it off, and walk away. It’s been empty now for 4 hours and I’m worried. He’s not eating and drinking, so without these fluids I’m scared his body is going to suffer more than it already is. 

We told the head nurse an hour ago and she didn’t even know it was empty. She checked his notes and they’ve been prescribed to him. We’re still waiting for these bags, for over an hour, and they’re still not here. 

I’m trying to hold it together but naturally due to stress, my anger is very sensitive right now. I feel like he’s being neglected. His organs are literally fading away and he can’t afford to have no fluids for 4 hours.

I have been fighting this for three years but for the last year treatment has just been palliative.  Even when I'm not on chemo I feel myself fading slowly. And there is absolutely no one that I can talk to about it.  

I have been the cheerful cancer warrior all this time but I just can't keep it up.  When I am sad, or frustrated or anything less than merry sunshine my family avoids me.  I know that it isn't malicious, they just aren't coping.  But what it means is I get the silent treatment from my husband and kids when I'm unhappy.  And I have talked to him about this *repeatedly*, but only after I cheer up again because that's what it takes to get him to speak to me.  

My closest friend can be good for some dark humor but a few weeks ago when my husband was avoiding me I texted her and she said she didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.  The two of them were already texting about me but neither would speak to me.  So I've had to revise my expectations from ""best friend"" to ""mutual friend"". 

My extended family has distanced themself since the terminal diagnosis. 

I am depressed, obviously and understandably.  I am on an antidepressant for nerve pain and it helps a little.  Cannabis oil (legal stuff) has really become a crutch because it's the only thing that keeps me smiling (and relieves other symptoms).  Yes I have had therapy, for me personally in my situation it just made me feel worse.

So here I am, on a tropical Christmas holiday that will certainly be my last, with 6 genuinely miserable humans that I love more than anything and no access to the medication that makes life bearable. And today was a bad day.  It should have been a good day, I had more strength and stamina than I have in quite a while.  But it was a bad day and I'm just really sad.  And I did not fly halfway around the world just to eat Costco pizza.

Onto other challenges! Thanks for all your responses. 


A very Long story made slightly shorter: my dad (stage IV NSCLC) had a major stroke in April, and since then, the doctors refused to give any more cancer treatment and  repeatedly said he was dying from his cancer (at first they said he only had hours to days to live, then days to weeks, then weeks to months, then will not survive to the end of summer, then to end of fall, end of winter, etc.) 

He developed a stage IV bedsore in hospital because the doctors and nurses thought he was going to die any day and didn’t put him on an air mattress despite him being paralyzed on one side and sedated so much that he could not move. The bedsore took 5-6 months to heal —  he wasn’t even expected to live that long. 

He had a huge appetite once she got him weened off of morphine and other palliative care meds that made him too drowsy to sit up. He wasn’t in any pain (or in minimal pain). His signs of pain (grimace on his face, yelling out, not sleeping longer than two hours at a time) were finally deemed to be resulting from his stroke as my mom had insisted for months. She fed him for months when they told him his body didn’t need food anymore because it was shutting down. 

Anyway, things changed in late October. He had a sepsis scare (very high fever, but resolved with antibiotics in he hospital). He’s been in hospital for more than 2 months now. 

He has no appetite anymore though (new symptom), but after all the false alarms in the past 8 months, my mom refuses to believe this is really the end and that his body is dying. She thinks if she just gets him to eat a little bit more every day, then he can recover, like he did (seemingly from the brink of death so many times already, after doctors all said it was futile). 

It’s really hard to watch him say “No, No, No” and her pleading and begging him to eat (otherwise he will “starve” to death). Sometimes he will make a sound that sounds like “yes” in their native language), and she will latch onto that, instead of the ten “No”s that preceded it. Sometimes he will even just shut his eyes and lips and turn his face away from her. 

I’ve told her again and again that this is new, and this really looks like the end, and it’s not helping him to feed him. That it’s causing her to be exhausted and stressed when he won’t eat. But because of all the false alarms, she won’t believe it. 

Do you think there’s anything I can say to help her understand that feeding him like this is wrong? Or do you think she is pre-grieving and this is just how it will play out until he dies? Sometimes she will cry and say “it’s over”, and then the next day, she will be asking me to call his oncologist and beg him to start his immunotherapy again (which they discontinued after the major stroke due to the constant looming death). 

Thanks in advance.",cilucia,,12,2019-12-28 04:10:42,8,eglyqt

My mother in law has metastatic breast cancer (liver, lungs, bones and now brain) and I don't really know where to start gathering info. She is trying to give us more info, but still I know no details other than she is undergoing radiation (whole head) so I guess gamma or surgery are not alternatives at this point. 
Because I know so little about her type and her mets I am googling blind, but I know she will die sooner or later - probably sooner.
 My in-laws are not very good at talking about these things and I will bet my arse she is trying to shield everyone, but me being me I want to prepare for what is coming. 
Because the radiation is whole head I assume there are multiple mets or deep seated, she has had a lot of hormone therapy + different chemo treatments but even though the cancer is not aggressive it does not shrink either. 

My better half is playing this by ear and doesn't talk about it unprovoked, but if she allows us to see her further down the line I would like to prepare and be able to be of some use. 
I have no problems with gritty stuff, and if someone has to stay on top I think I would be the person who could, but it is so hard to prepare when so little info is given.

Sorry for the essay, but I would really like some tips on what to read etc., so I can be prepared in case we get to take part of the palliative care.

Also I would love tips on how to support her husband, who is the very typical stoic type. Last time I saw them I noticed he has a need to talk about it, but I don't want to push too hard. (Picture a man thinking that Aspirin is a coward's way of not being able to handle life) He will be alone after this, so I try to establish some kind of routine where we 'shoot the shit', but at this time it feels forced.",Spazquatch,,4,2020-01-09 22:06:26,3,emguke

To day I'm still confused about it. She was very courageous cosmopolitan woman. She was very impressive how she fight during her illness and end of life. 

I wrote to all people involved here. Especially if you are struggling with pancreas cancer. The cancer caused to my mother a big pain and to all our family. No one was ready of the announcement of her illness and end of life.

I have spent A LOT of time replaying everything over in my head, and torturing myself over things I wish I could change, that I simply can’t. So I thought I would share my experiences with anyone who wants an insight into what’s to come, what I did and what I would do differently in the hopes it helps even just one of you guys take a tiny bit of the sting out of a truly evil situation.

I’m going to focus on the final parts of my journey, but please, if you have any questions about any part of my experience, my messages are open. Also we live in the UK, so I’m not sure how similar the palliative care offered is to other countries. If you are going through this now and are worried this will cause you more fear of what’s to come, please message me and I will answer anything I can in as nicer way as possible for you. 

So Dad had Pancreatic Cancer that after a long fight, spread to his liver. 

We took him into hospital because he was experiencing intense pain in his abdomen. Although it wasn’t confirmed, I’m pretty sure his Bile Duct had ruptured. They wanted to operate but when they looked, they saw that the cancer had spread to the Liver and any surgical intervention would have caused more damage then good. 

He went into our local hospice and had a syringe driver fitted. They told us he had a few weeks left. 

When we had first discussed end of life care a few weeks previous to this, they had mentioned going into a hospice. Dad didn’t want to die at home because he didn’t want the family home to be a reminder of his final battle, and inevitable defeat. This hurt me. The thought of him dying somewhere he wasn’t familiar with, surrounded by staff he didn’t know terrified me. I wanted him to go surrounded by the abundance of love my family and I had for him. This, in my opinion I think was my first mistake, and I’ll come back to as to why shortly. 

So we eventually took him home where he slowly deteriorated over a period of about two months. He was a warrior through and through, and went on to defy every doctors opinion in regard to the time he had left. He had nurses come and change his driver daily, and top up the morphine as and when required... I think every other day or so. This is when he started to get forgetful and confused. We laughed with him at what we could to ease the pain of the situation, like him trying to shave with the TV remote. 

Dad was an ostrich. He had buried his head in the sand his whole life when difficult situations required an emotional approach to resolve. He wasn’t good at that, and this is where my biggest regret is. A few days before he died when he was still fairly coherent, I’d been to see him after work like I did every day. When I was about to leave because, I leant over to give him a hug, but this time I held on instead of leaving straight away. I think I hugged him for about 3 seconds when he asked me to stop because it was upsetting him. And I did, because the last thing I wanted to do was upset a dying man. In retrospect I wish I hadn’t. That was the last ever reciprocated cuddle I had with my Daddy. I wish so hard, every day that I had told him that it was ok to be sad and scared, but that I was there with him every step of the way. I wish I had said, “I know you are scared and don’t want to acknowledge what’s happening, but I’m your little boy, I’m scared to lose my dad and although I don’t want to upset you, you aren’t going to be here to cuddle me when I really need it when you’re gone, so please can we just cuddle and cry today, and go back to ignoring it tomorrow?”

This is obviously a very tricky situation because your instinct is to protect your dying loved ones as much as possible, but as I said, they won’t be here to help when you’re grieving for them. Gauge the time/situation as best you can and push for that hug as sensitively as you can. You don’t want to regret not doing so, trust me. 

A couple of days later he went down hill fast. He lost his ability to talk and move. This was hard. Hard to see him this way, but also hard to care for. We had been given the option to have nurses with us full time, but my mum and I wanted to keep him as comfortable as possible, and to us that meant keeping strangers away as much as possible. The night before he died we had to try and move him so that he could be washed and toilet etc. I was terrified. He was so frail and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt him and then have to wait for a doctor to come out and give him more pain relief. It wasn’t until a few weeks after he passed away that I began to regret not accepting the extra nurses, or at least discussing him going into the hospice for his end of life care. The round the clock nurses and equipment available to help people in his condition would have made this part so much more bearable for both him and my family. And they look after you too! They let you stay as much as you want to, set up a bed for you to sleep in and keep you updated every step of the way. 

The night he died will stay with me forever. We had finally made him comfortable thanks to my amazing Sister and Auntie who work I’m elderly care. Without them the entire timeline of his final days would have been even more unbearable and impossible, and I think I’d have much harsher regrets / opinions of myself now. 

This next part is fairly graphic I think, but I wish someone had been able to tell me what was going to happen. I think nurses and doctors tried but everything was sugar coated. 

I went to bed because I’d been up with him for about 48 hours and I was exhausted. My sister came to get me when his breathing changed. I can’t tell you exactly how it changed but I think it became very soft and barely noticeable. I sat next to him and my mum told him I was there. He passed away roughly 10 seconds after. I had no idea it would be that quick and still I hate myself for going to bed instead of spending every single second possible with him while he was still here. When they say to be with them because it’s imminent, in my opinion, do it. Don’t leave unless you absolutely have to. That 10 seconds was nowhere near enough time to say goodbye to my hero. I don’t think any amount of time is enough, but 10 seconds was heartbreaking. 

The passing itself was peaceful. He literally just stopped breathing and passed. But very soon after the body relaxes and fluids are released. The entire thing is a bit of a blur still and I think always will be, but I’m pretty sure we needed to wash him within a minute or so of him passing. The smell was horrendous. It will live with me forever, and again, had he been in a hospice, we wouldn’t have had to deal with that. 
When we rolled him onto his side, the contents of his stomach leaked from his mouth and onto the bed, as well as some blood from his nose. This really affected me.... I’m not sure why because logically it’s fairly obvious that this would happen, but it just wasn’t something I was prepared for, and I wish someone had given me the heads up. I think people are too scared to talk about this sort of stuff when your face to face with losing someone you love, but for me I wish I would have been warned. 

In the UK, you have to ring to get a Doctor to come out to you and confirm that the person is deceased. They were very good on the phone but it took them a good hour to get to us. And hour where I had to sit next to my dads body. I didn’t want to be there, looking at him, but I didn’t want to leave him cold and on his own. I was still very protective of him. 

The doctor arrived and checked for a heart beat and pulse. Once he confirmed that he had passed away, he gave us some paperwork and left. Then we had to ring the funeral home to come and collect him. Luckily we lived a couple of minutes from our chosen home, so we didn’t have to wait long for him to be picked up. But they took him away in a black body bag which was awful to watch. My advice here would be to say your goodbyes and not watch this part. It breaks whatever part of your heart is left in tact. 

Another thing that I wasn’t told is how fast the body will go cold. I think I leant in to kiss dad a few minutes after he had passed, and he was already stone cold which again just added to the heartbreak. 

I’m sorry if this last few pieces read as though they are rushed, but this has been very difficult to write. 

I am also sorry if you are going though this and are now even more scared of what is to come, but as I have said more than once, I wish I had known these things beforehand. 

My own personal views and summary of advice to take away from this....

Spend as much time as you can with your loved one as possible. Cherish the small things like how it feels to hold their warm hand, or kiss them on the forehead. 
If they are resistant to acknowledging what is about to happen, gauge the situation, time, place and surroundings and sensitively ask them for what you need to cope when they are gone. That last long hug. The apology you have never made for something that may be long forgotten but you know you don’t want to live with not making.
Accept help where you can. The strangers very quickly become friends in these situations and make everything more bearable. They also help to shield you from things you may not want to experience and will do anything to help you if they can. They’re not just there for the patient. 

Finally, I send so much love to anyone going through this. Whether you’re waiting on a diagnosis, going through treatment, waiting for the worst to happen or grieving for someone you have lost. So much love ❤️ you are not alone and I am more than happy to talk if you want to.",MorphinBlue,,28,2020-02-06 12:04:25,45,ezreh3

Prior to her cancer diagnosis she had been diagnosed and treated for anxiety, and depression. She was non compliant and non adherent with her mental health care in the past. Never completed therapy or medication. 

When she was initially diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer she had a week long psychotic episode. She was paranoid that the doctors and nurses were out to get her, didn’t trust the medicine they were giving her etc. Her admitting physician finally got psych involved and she was medicated. The psychotic episode has ended, but she is still distrusting and sometimes non compliant. She was placed in rehab after surgery. She’s refusing PT sometimes and refusing meds sometimes. She is extremely depressed, but is better than she was before. She is still under psychiatric care and has been going to counseling daily. She has only been getting psychiatric treatment for 3 weeks and the effects of the meds take time. Time which she doesn’t really have. 

Her cancer has high levels of the genetic mutation that make it susceptible to effective treatment by Keytruda or other immunotherapy. 

From what I know now it looks like oncology doesn’t want to treat her at all. Other than palliative care and radiation, no chemo, no immunotherapy, because of her behavior, which is caused by her mental illness, which until now has not been treated.

We have a meeting on Monday. We are moving her into assisted living after rehab to force a modicum of compliance with care. My concern is that the docs may not give her a shot at treatment because of her underlying mental health issues. Which she is seeking treatment for, finally. 

She is otherwise competent. Very intelligent and aware of everything that is going on. She is young and if not for the mental health issues should be a candidate for aggressive treatment.

It’s a perfect storm. She’s finally getting mental health care but it may be to late. I know she wants to do treatment. 

Anyone been through something like this? What should I do? I don’t want my mom to die of mental illness with cancer. Thought? Advice? Support?",ParcelBobo,,5,2020-02-22 00:30:34,2,f7kmj5

She has a host of issues, extreme scoliosis, degenerative bone something or other, fibromyalgia, etc.  She handled it all like a champ day in and day out. She had a palliative care pain management regime that worked for her. On a normal day you wouldn't even know she had problems.


Last week she had to call 911 because she had trouble breathing. She had a mass on her lung along with pneumonia, they did a biopsy and all that. She was in hospital for about 6 days and they discharged her with oxygen to use at home.  Even then she seemed pretty fine, she had a ton of trouble breathing  when bending over or sitting down  but managed for 4 days. But I had to call 911 again because I knew she wasn't able to catch her breath and was suffering. 

Now she's in hospital, has aggressive small cell lung cancer, can't breath on her own, is on 100% oxygen. Her pain management medication is evidently higher than the hospital has ever seen (300mg morphine 3x per day is what she took at home) and it was an incredible hassle to finally get them to put her on enough to make her comfortable. 

It was brutal sitting there while she was in incredible pain and she kept telling them (via writing ) how cruel this is. But she has finally gotten the medication she needs and is sleeping. 

I signed a hospice form. But have no idea wtf that means. Keep getting different answers to what hospice entails. All I care about is she doesn't suffocate and her medication stays similar to what she has always taken at home and is comfortable. But can't get a straight answer. 

This blows.



Edit - well shit, she left this world at 4:33pm pst.  Happy she is no longer in pain but it sucked. They took off the oxygen and hearing her gasps for breath for almost an hour was excruciating. Her tolerance was so high they had to keep giving her morphine. I kept telling her to just let go and was incredibly relieved when she finally did. 

Anybody have a suggestion on a website or resource that can help me navigate what I need to do regarding her bills, lease, etc. Also just to make sure I'm not responsible for any debt she may have right?",tedistkrieg,,4,2020-02-24 19:46:31,13,f8wvlc

I have been holding out hope for the last 2.5 (almost 3) years of treatment that I’d beat this thing, but I just had a major setback. One so major, that now I’m considered terminal. 

I’ll post the backstory of my diagnosis below. 

I’m really struggling with the concept of time and feeling alone . I don’t know how much time I have. It could be weeks out it could be months. I am 31, and I don’t know anyone my age going through anything close to what I’m going through. I attend a young adult cancer support group and even within my group, they are all survivors or are dealing with very treatable cancers. I know that’s no guarantee, but none of them are the same status as me.  

I know that this cancer is going to win and I’m trying my hardest to not let it make the end sad, but I’m having a hard time finding activities or things I can do to make happy memories. Well, moreso the happy part. I feel like I can’t really enjoy the things I’m doing because there is a little voice saying “What if this is the last time you’ll do this? Better make it count somehow.”

Are there any of you out there struggling with the same thing?  Does anyone have any advice?

Please don’t just tell me to talk to a therapist, I have one.



Diagnosis: Wilms Tumer Stage IV, recently found out my liver is slowly failing, went from 2 small mets to my liver almost being taken over (and almost 3x the size) by 12-15 mets. Also have multiple soft tissue implants, one near my pelvic area that is slowly hemorrhaging.

My mom (46) has stage IV colon cancer with metastasis to her lungs, liver, and ovaries. She doesn't have any other comorbidities. She's had increasingly terrible pain along her abdomen with tenderness and (very very visible) bloating. Her oncologist tried to manage it with pain medication (morphine ER 30mg q 12 hr and dilaudid 4mg q 4 hr), but alas, it did little to help. My mom wanted to be admitted to the ER because any time she ate or drink, pain would follow.

We've been here since Feb 24 and unfortunately, my mom has started throwing up. There have been a number of general tests like CT with contrast and X-ray obstructive series which show that there might be a partial obstruction, but nothing definitive.

There are few routes of treatment:

1. Surgery. I've had two opinions and both surgeons agree that they would be operating without a clear picture. They don't think it's an obstruction and it's the cancer giving her these problems. They're afraid that surgery would worsen her condition and/or she wouldn't be able to handle it. They've introduced the idea of hospice.
2. Continue with chemotherapy along with palliative care. Chemo and radiation to buy her more time, she has been stable with her chemo regimen in regards to her tumor. Palliative care to manage her symptoms (pain, vomiting, and nausea).
3. Hospice.

I'm not sure what to do. My mom isn't either. We both agree that her pain and other symptoms should be managed, but at what cost and risk?

I'm asking if anyone has had a similar situation and what they did. Any advice is much appreciated.

Edit: My mom started coughing up tumor and hasn’t been able to hold anything down. Surgeons no longer want to operate. We’ve decided on hospice. Thank you to those that responded.",couldnotpickone,,6,2020-03-10 01:33:05,3,fg5y4v

January 2019, they found a 2 cm diameter tumor at her routine MRI scan. No big deal. Except now we knew it could come back. One surgery and a few radiation sessions later, and she is cancer free again. Then comes July 2019. She is super tired and sleeping a lot so she goes into her neurologist to see what's up.

My mother is coming to live with me today after living with my sister since surgery 4 weeks ago or so and now I'm going to look after her. Problem is I have 2 cats. My sister said to keep them away from her but I can't keep them outside all the time. 

My mother hasn't started chemo yet, that's a month away. She just had surgery to get a stoma bag attached. The plan was for her to go back and stay with my sister while she does chemo as we think she can better care for her and it's more homely but she also said that she can't take my mother back if she's been in contact with cats.

Does anyone have any info on this? I read mixed opinions everywhere. It's going to be palliative chemo if that matters at all. As far as I'm aware, her immune system isn't compromised now or is it? 

Any help on this is greatly appreciated. Need to figure out my next move fast.

Thanks

Just to add; we've all been practicing social distancing etc. and been very careful in every aspect of this thus far and hope to remain just as careful and vigilant.

Second edit: just to clarify, my mother adores the cats. She said she wished she could hug them. It's her fear of not being able to go back to my sister's post chemo to recover due to my sister's fear of our mom getting something from the cats. One is outdoors a lot and there's no way we can keep him in or he'll go mad and then so will we.

**Background**

My mum has an incurable form of cancer. We are on the last chemo drug with a low response rate. The oncologists has said that other options are unlikely to be effective. It is VERY obvious that the current one isn't working (visible tumors still growing). I heard my mum expressing to her friends that this is like issuing a death sentence to her and she is just waiting for death. She has some glimmer of hope that maybe if we see another oncologist for a second opinion, there could be a solution. I browsed the medical literature online - there is simply no cure for this so even if somehow another drug can be used, it will merely prolong her live (and not cure the cancer).

We discussed stem cell transplant with the oncologist who said that it would not work on my mum because the cancer is not even under control + the high mortality risk associated with such a procedure.

**Question**

At some point, whatever hope my mother has would disappear. Was wondering if you all have thoughts on how I can soften the blow?

I have read threads on this subreddit where upon being told that chemo no longer works, a patient just loses all hope and deteriorates rapidly (can't find that post but it will always stay at the back of my mind).

I have tried introducing the possibility that nothing will work by saying the following:

* ""even if there are no treatment options, that will not be the end, they will continue to treat your symptoms to make sure you are well taken care of""

So far she seems to have taken them well but what just unsettles me is when she said ""at least I am still undergoing chemo"" which indicates to me that she is still clinging on to some hope that it may work.

He's been doing chemo ever since, alongside some radiation at times. His cancer metastasized to his lungs, in both lobes. Today we got the dreadful news that his mets have doubled in size. His last scan was in December. He has a persistent cough for like 2 months now.

I'm an only child and I'm terrified of losing him. My mom has some mental issues, so she depends on me. He's always been my rock. I'm married and have a baby who's 2 months old. I'm devastated at thinking my son won't know him. I'm devastated at thinking about a future without him in it. I'm devastated at the thought of never hearing his voice and his advice again. 

His oncologist says it's palliative care and extending time now. I feel guilty that I haven't been good enough, that I didn't give him more grandchildren, that I didn't have children soon enough, that I'm not smart enough, wise enough.

She’s in the palliative stage but is still very mobile and appears really good for her age. We’re anticipating a few months until she dies, with a rapid decline at a random point.

People have gotten wind of this and naturally, want to come and visit. Mum has said she doesn’t want many visitors. However, people have started dropping in unannounced. Unfortunately, mum is the kind of person that won’t say no, so she will spend time with them. 

If her guests can’t see her when they drop in, I say “I’ll go check on her” and can easily run interference and tell them she is sleeping, no problems. The problem we’re finding is when people see her through the window and see she is awake, and then she kind of falls into the old routine of engaging in conversation etc.

My question is, what are some ways of basically saying to people “I know mum looks good, but these visits are waring her out and even though she looks like she’s enjoying it, she needs to conserve her energy Because she will be exhausted later. Thanks for coming by, it’s great you did that, but if you could give us a call first next time, it will help us make sure she’s up for it, or find a time that’s best.”

I know this sounds silly; she’s dying so she doesn’t have to do anything for anyone and she/we don’t have to apologise, but I really need help properly phrasing this, because I’m aware cancer affects more than the person and their direct family, and I don’t want to make other people feel bad on top of their own grief...I just don’t want them to visit and burden mum.

It’s just my mom and I. All of her sisters and brothers are back in our country and I have no siblings either. My mom has been through so much in her life. She experienced life in a war torn country while pregnant and having to escape. She came to Canada with a child on her own and worked so fucking hard as a single parent to do everything to make my life amazing. She put me through university and gave me so much love and wonderful memories. She bought me my first car with no credit and anything at all that I wished for she made happen. She’s so gentle and sweet and so patient and kind. She made the most delicious food. She would listen and care about anything I had to say. I could complain about something for hours and she would just make me feel better and never get annoyed. She would cut up fruit and make me plate of snacks and bring to my room while I was studying. It breaks my heart that I spent so much time cooped up studying instead of more time hanging out with my mom while she’s healthy and well. I hate this feeling. 

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last May. She was doing so well and had so much energy. She was getting chemotherapy and would come home after and make food or we would go for a walk. It was so amazing to see her thriving. However, they found out that as the cancer was shrinking everywhere else it was getting larger on her ovaries. They then had to stop chemotherapy for a month and do a surgery to remove her ovaries. While at the hospital she developed pneumonia and that made healing difficult. She then got discharged after but still felt so much pain in her abdomen. She spent a whole month in bed thinking it’s the healing process but she literally couldn’t sit without feeling pain. Even after telling her oncologist she’s feeling so much pain and isn’t ready for chemotherapy they did nothing and said to keep resting. At her next appointment she continued to tell her she’s not feeling good so they do CT scan and find out she has an abscess so they had to do drainage this continued to make it so she could not receive chemo for so long and that was not good. Her fingers and feet also developed neuropathy and so they had to switch the chemo. 

She began to feel nauseous and puked a few times after eating so I brought her to the hospital and had to be admitted again for them to find out she has an obstruction. She was able to recover from the obstruction on her own and was sent home feeling good. Unfortunately that lasted 5 days and the symptoms returned and she had to go back again and has been there for over a month. They had to do one surgery to get around the obstruction but that surgery failed and ended up causing an infection due to leakage. Her blood pressure decreased drastically and heart rate increased. It was so scary. They had to redo the surgery and she spent days in the ICU. The worst and most heartbreaking thing is having a doctor FaceTime you to talk about the “next steps” saying if the ostomy doesn’t start working on its own there is nothing left they can do. Thankfully it began to work, however her feet and legs up to her knees have swelled up so much after the surgery that she is literally not able to lift her feet get up on her own without the help of two other people. 

She’s very upset because she is so used to being independent and doing everything on her own. She’s bed ridden and it’s so hard to watch. She has lost a lot of weight and I’m devastated seeing her this way. They are now talking about palliative care and moving her to a hospital that offers that or to bring her home and have home care constantly coming. I don’t know what’s worse. I’m just so torn and feel like my life is completely falling apart and everyone else is moving along. I don’t want to live a life where my mom isn’t here. She won’t be able to meet her grandchildren or see me get my career started. She’s my best friend and I truly don’t feel like I can go on without her.",civonuap94,t3_h04ily,20,2020-06-10 05:27:42,38,h04ily

I work for the strategy group of a large cancer center in the US. Our work in strategy is centered around how we allocate resources. Recently, we've been exploring how we might better serve patients and caregivers during their cancer treatment. 

There is typically such a focus on the medical/clinical side of things, especially dealing with symptoms, etc. that I feel like patients just get overwhelmed. It comes from a place of caring, but sometimes, I can just tell we're unloading too much information onto people. Maybe we need to slow down and be present more often. 

However, I am wondering if people wish there were resources and services that they've either heard about, or seen here, that would have made a difference for them, either in the treatment itself, or in the emotional/psychological/spiritual side of things. We have a donor who wants to explore ideas and possibly fund them. 

Some programs that have always looked amazing to me are Commonweal's Cancer Help Program, where I know we've referred some patients, and Camp Kesem (for kids of cancer patients). But I feel like we could be doing a lot more. These could include home care, group support outside of the hospital, palliative care, and similar programs. 

I've been a lurker here for several years. So I've seen some things pop up from time to time, but I would love to hear from you about any non-standard, or even existing programs that were especially helpful to you.",davidfwallace,t3_h0jf3v,6,2020-06-10 20:27:26,1,h0jf3v

What about when I have my own children and I want her to meet them? 
I understand it’s the process of life and everyone must experience loss. I just still cannot come to terms with my situation being so depressing and the fact that I will be left with no immediate family (no siblings, no father and other family are across the globe..)

&amp;#x200B;

Few days back mother has been diagnosed with Gall bladder cancer stage 4 with Metastasis to liver which was found accidentally.  Around 7 years back she had been diagnosed with gallstones or stones in gall bladder. Now the oncologists say Gallstones may be the reason for gall bladder cancer.  However in those 7 years we have done number of scans for other reasons but never we were told gallstones can cause gallbladder cancer ; all this time we were told to surgically remove gall stones but it is not an urgent procedure so may wait when emergency arises due to pain caused by gall stones.

&amp;#x200B;

Now mother has about 80 mm \* 80 mm sized tumor on liver, Oncologists are suggesting chemotherapy ( Gemcitabine and Cisplatin ) . After 2 cycles progress will be checked if it doesn't work all treatments will be stopped and mother will be put under palliative care .

&amp;#x200B;

we were given a timeline of &lt;1 year if chemo works , if it doesn't work then about 6 months. Mother and family members are trying to decide if chemo is worth the risk of sideeffects . 

&amp;#x200B;

My fellow community members, please let me know if you have also faced similar situation of selecting treatment for gall bladder cancer.",marscommander,t3_hha36m,9,2020-06-28 07:03:49,20,hha36m

My poor best friend of 18 years is only 30 and was told last year she had one year to live, stage 4 cancer. She was very fit, healthy, did a heck of a lot more diet and exercise than me. Diagnosis came very suddenly after the birth of her baby. She barely had symptoms. She has two babies and her husband. 

She felt and looked fine. Then tried platinum chemo and none of it worked, around the 5th cycle she started to become very weak. Her doctor then told her to continue to cycle 7. She did this and she really went down hill and became poorly. Since this didn't work she would have no other options and now was palliative. She could not accept this and neither could we.

We did crowdfunding and the nhs hospital agreed to try immunotherapy on a private basis based on research and the therapy working in her type of cancer. She had her second cycle of immunotherapy a few weeks ago and it's honestly like it's destroying her :(. 

She is in absolute agony, screaming pain. She can't get out of bed, can't look after the kids and is only awake maybe 3 hours per day. Thankfully her family have her, the kids and husband staying with them for care and support  She is barely eating as she has no appetite, wasting away. She has tried everything from opiates, tramadol, ketamine, gabapentin to the traditional aspirin, ibuprofen and tramadol! Nothing is working :(. She can barely move it is just so hard to watch. I have a gut feeling that this is all really bad signs and that we are losing her. Her family are still saying the therapy will work etc but i'm just not sure anymore. 

Does anyone have any positive, hopeful stories? I know everyone's journey is unique but even just some words of wisdom.",Dustyboop,t3_hk7zol,44,2020-07-02 23:25:41,42,hk7zol

What to expect?","My mom was diagnosed with an aggressive and rare type of breast cancer in January 2019. Chemo worked. She was operated. They gave radiation to decrease the chance of recurrence, but before the treatment was over the cancer had spread to her lungs. We found this out in October 2019. They gave another trearment. In February this year we found out it spread to her liver. She got an experimental treatment that didn't work for her during which the cancer spread to her eyes and brain. Her liver had worsened as well. She got the same chemotreatment as the one she was on first. It seemed to help a little but they stopped it for some time so they could give radiation treatment for her brain. Today the chemo was supposed to start again. My mom has been having a lot of pain from her liver this weekend and she has been feeling very tired. So she expected her bloodcount would be too low for chemo and she expected to get a blood transfusion. To our surprise, we get the news that they're stopping treatment and they're starting up morfine to reduce the pain (palliative care).

This feels like such a whirlwind. Up until when she was getting the radiation for her brain (which ended a week ago) the doctors kept telling us not to give up hope and not to panick. I knew she couldn't be cured, but with the message they were giving I assumed she still had months (at least), especially since the chemo seemed to be working somewhat. I don't really know what to expect. The doctor said she would slip into a coma at some point, but he said he couldn't really indicate how long she still has. I know they're giving her medication to keep the pain under control, but I just keep asking myself whether the body might not give some kind of stress reaction in the end making her feel anxious or something. I just hope she is comfortable...

I'm still sitting with her in the hospital atm while she's sleeping. She hasn't said a lot since she got the news. My dad was very worried this morning, but due to corona only one person could come with her. I don't live with my parents anymore, so I was unaware of how much it had worsened in a few days. If I knew what was up and how worried my dad was, I would have given my spot to him. We haven't informed him yet since I don't want to tell him over the phone. The whole thing feels very weird and tense, sitting here, being the only one that knows and trying not to be too emotional because I don't want to burden my mom any further.

He went into severe hypovolemic and septic shock. It was fast, on the night he was admitted to the ICU he was up talking and I spoke with him at 11:00 PM. His last words to me were “I love you babygirl, don’t worry about me and have a great day at work tomorrow”. Less than 24 hours later he was intubated, maxed out on four pressors, on CRRT (continuous dialysis), was hypothermic and in shock liver. I asked for a sign from my dad that he was ready to go and a couple minutes later he started bleeding from his central line site. I asked the palliative care doctor, who confirmed he’d gone into DIC - essentially his blood stopped clotting. I’d had a patient of my own go into DIC and it was extremely traumatic for providers and family. I knew it was his time. 

My dad was the greatest man in the world. He was loved by every single person that met him. He was a lover of a well mixed Canadian club cocktail, his Weber grill, his tritoon and cleaning the countertops. He was the most organized and responsible person I’ve ever known and it led him down the path to great prosperity and happiness.

It spread to his peritoneal lining which doctors kept telling us is harder to treat than if it were on a vital organ. We all kept positive throughout that time. My dad especially. He’s a tough as nails USMC vet who never complained, never gave up and always gave us so much love. Endless love. It doesn’t feel real. Me and my mom were lucky enough to be there with him and hold his hands, telling him how much we love him and that we’ll be okay without him. I kept crying on and off. He originally went to the ER yesterday for a bowel obstruction, uncontrollably committing the entire night and day. Then the palliative care doctor called me around 3 PM. It happened so fast. He had an oxygen mask on and wasn’t receiving fluids since it was filling up his lungs and his heart wasn’t responding well to it. I knew he hated the mask. I asked him to confirm if he wanted hospice care, he nodded his head. He knew it was the end. I did too. My mom was more in shock, in denial of it. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask and put an oxygen tube through his nose (cannula I think,) his breathing immediately shortened and shallowed. He couldn’t breathe on his own. They gave him morphine, so he wasn’t in any pain. The sweet nurse offered him a Coke, but he was too weak. The palliative care doctor was very kind to my family and my dad as well, which I’m so appreciative of. My mom held his hand the entire time while praying with him. Then my dad suddenly stopped breathing. I know people always say “it happened so fast,” but it’s taken me enduring this to realize it’s true. Time wasn’t real in the hospital. They were supposed to move him to an upper floor, but we stayed with him in the dark ER room. When I realized how quickly he stopped breathing, I panicked and ran outside to the nurse station just shouting that my dad stopped breathing. Three of them came inside and immediacy began doing CPR, and my mom started bawling. I’ve never ever seen my mom cry like that before. My sadness turned into shock, and I wrapped my arms around my mom to comfort her while she sobbed. She was staring the whole time as they were trying to revive him. I told her to look away if it was too hard. I was crying a little bit, but knew I needed to comfort her. I’m still shocked. I went through his cellphone and found old videos and pictures of me and him. They made me breakdown. It dawned on me that I’ll never get a text from him again. Never go to the grocery store with him again. Never get advice from him again. Never hear his dark, yet endearing marine humor again. It feels like I’m not living my own life. I’m going through the motions. I’m scared of the future. I’m 20 years old, barely about to begin college this fall. My brother is only 15. My boyfriend is also in the Marine Corp, and only got to meet my dad once last year. It’s all so confusing and I feel lost and broken. I know with time me and my family will be okay again. But a part of me has died with my dad. The only thing that gives me peace is knowing he wasn’t in pain when he went, and that he’s no longer suffering but whole again in the kingdom of heaven. If anyone out there is going through something similar, or if you’re blessed enough to have your loved one still alive and breathing, please be with them. Take pictures of them and with them. Take videos. Record their voice. Tell them you love them. Life can be cruel and short for some. I never thought I wouldn’t have my dad around at 20 years old. I’m his girl. He taught me so much and loved me so much and I’ll strive everyday to be the kind of person he’d be proud of. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place. My brain is hazy right now.

Backstory: I (24f) have two sets of parents- adoptive and birth. My birth father and my adoptive mom are siblings, so I was raised kinda by both sets. When the pandemic started, I was in my home country with my adoptive parents while my birth parents got stuck in the US. My BioDad(BD from now) is a US citizen who has the equivalent of a green card in our home country; and BioMom’s(BM) status is the opposite. BioSiblings are also in the states. 

Now on to the actual dilemma;
Adoptive Dad( AD, 66M) just got diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer with Mets. We were in the hospital 14 days then we were sent home for about 6 for him to gain strength so that they could start chemo. 

His condition is incurable- so they were planning on starting with palliative chemo on July 1st. But before they could start, his body developed an infection so he had to be taken back to the hospital. We have been here since the end of June.

Now my bio parents(BP) are obviously very involved in whatever way they can be- monetary, office staff helping us etc but they’re physically not here because international travel in my country is not allowed for non citizens and flights aren’t really coming. However the govt is shuttling citizens back from foreign countries but only from certain airports. BP’s live about a 10hour drive from the closest city that has any travel possible to my country. Also the shuttle planes aren’t that reliable- like they won’t tell you the date of travel- only a window and they’ll tell you day of the actual flight and you have to report to the airport. 

Because of the above reasons and the general lack of safety of international travel during a pandemic, up until this point, I have been telling the BPs not to travel. 

But my AD’s condition seems to be worsening. He isn’t stable for chemo and is losing hope. The docs are a bit stumped at the pace of deterioration as well. 

And AM and I are struggling being the only ones who can visit AD in the hospital. I’ve barely been spending any time with her as well- one of us is always with AD at the hospital. 

I feel like I am absolutely alone and seeing his health deteriorate, is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Every part of me wants to just tell the BPs fuck the difficulty traveling and just come- I need the support here. But another part of me feels that I can’t risk another parent getting sick and landing up in the hospital.

So reddit, help! Tell me what I should do, should I ask people to come and risk it, or should I do this alone and not let them know exactly how bad it is so that they’re not tempted to fly back?

Update: so he’s gone- no need for the extra support now.

Recently, thanks to a less than helpful urologist, he ended up in septic shock due to a bladder infection, which lead to a 911 call and a week in ICU. They got him out of kidney failure but they're still working on the liver failure that it caused. My problem is that they are talking about discharging him in a few days and I'm not sure what to do. We live in a small apartment in the city and neither of us has family close by. 

Until two weeks ago he was feeling ""normal"", still able to sit up and move around on his own, even continuing to work from home on his laptop. As of today, he can barely lift his own head. We live on the 3rd floor of a walkup. We had been talking about finding a new place on a lower level but hadn't gotten around to it yet when this all happened unexpectedly last week. I've been asked about hospice by the hospital but we hadn't made any real plans (ironically we had a palliative care appointment to talk about it at the cancer center later this week). Our options right now are: have an EMS team carry him back up the stairs leaving him trapped in the small one-bedroom apartment we call home (not great), find a local hospice for him to stay at (better but it kills me because I know that's the last thing he wants), or use a non-emergency transport service/rent an accessible van to move him four hours down to his father's ranch so he can spend the time he has left somewhere he enjoys and I can get some help taking care of him. His parents are offering to help however they can but I'm worried that moving him that far is going to be expensive and difficult. I guess I'm wondering if this is a crazy idea or is it actually doable?


Update 7/25: We started to make plans to get him to the ranch but unfortunately his condition has deteriorated since yesterday and it looks like he won't be able to survive the trip to his dad's ranch if we take him out there. Life expectancy once discharged from the hospital has gone from 1-2 months to a week or less. Due to this we've decided to admit him to the hospice connected to to the hospital. It's not what either of us hoped for, but at least I still get to visit and be with him for the time he has left. 

Thanks to everyone for sharing their thoughts and wishing us well.",melancholyandmerlot,t3_hw7chd,7,2020-07-23 02:15:13,17,hw7chd

&amp;nbsp;

I believe that when he was diagnosed it was already too late, his cancer had gone untreated for very long and the tumor had actually burst, which is why he had a fever. But we didn't know this back then. 

&amp;nbsp;

He had surgery immediately after the diagnosis in April, but they couldn't get everything out. He went back home with my mom 3 weeks later and wasn't really careful enough and ate whatever he wanted, he had a bowel obstruction a couple of weeks later. 

&amp;nbsp;

He was taken to a bigger hospital in June and had emergency surgery for the bowel obstruction. The main surgeon told us how bad it actually was and that he really thought he wasn't going to make it through the surgery. He was given 6 months to live in June. 

&amp;nbsp;

This was awful to process, I don't live with my parents, I live and work in a different country so I couldn't just go see them whenever. But I was able to take two weeks off work from July 20 until July 31. HR was understanding. 

&amp;nbsp;

He was put on a lot of painkillers after the second surgery, the recovery process was delicate but he was discharged and allowed to go into hospice at home on July 9 which was the only thing he wanted.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, the painkillers he was prescribed for the home hospice weren't nearly as strong as the ones he was administered inside the hospital unit, nor was the administration as effective.

&amp;nbsp;

He developed an infection during his home stay and his health declined very quickly. He was taken back to the first clinic in order to receive palliative/end-of-life care on July 14.

&amp;nbsp;

It was finally time for me to take time off work and travel to go see him on Monday July 20. It was a long trip and I went to the clinic directly.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom walked me to his room, I'll never forget the number N°206. When she opened the door I entered the room but my first reaction was to turn back because I thought my mom had made a mistake and I had walked into the wrong room.

&amp;nbsp;

She looked at me wondering what I was doing, I looked back at her and all I could whisper was ""Is that him?"", ""Yes dear, that's him"", she said.

&amp;nbsp;

I broke down like a literal child, I couldn't breathe, talk or even cry properly for a whole minute. He was barely conscious, his eyes were closed, he was pale and full of bruises, he was extremely skinny but the tumors had taken over his abdominal area. He could barely breathe through his wide open mouth. His face looked nothing like him, he was malnourished because he couldn't eat. I did not recognize my dad. He had no life left in him.

&amp;nbsp;

But, somehow, when I called his name and said it was me he mustered up enough strength to open his eyes and lightly smile as if he was telling me that he heard me and that he was happy to see me. I told him I loved him, I thanked him for everything he has done for me and I promised him I was going to be strong for myself and for my mom.

&amp;nbsp;

I told him it was okay if he wanted to rest, I told him it was okay to let go. He was heavily sedated on both a strong benzodiapezine and morphine, so I don't know if he actually processed or remembered anything. But I like to believe so.

&amp;nbsp;

Me and my mom went back home and I cried my eyes out until I went to bed. My mother has surprisingly been handling the whole thing very well. I was the one who was a mess.

&amp;nbsp;

The next morning, on Tuesday, my mom got a call at 11:45am. My dad passed away peacefully and without pain on Tuesday, July 21 2020 at 11:40am. The doctors say he waited until I got there to let go. I hope it's true. I am still very sad.

English is not my native language
There will be small parts, I apologize, I want to tell my son’s story but it is so hard to write in one time.*

I have been hesitating to write on this since a year. It is a too personal, and so terrible to think about. I am writing for memories, a walk down memory lane, may this help me never forget.

**Part1**
My son had a high grade Glioblastoma diagnosed on 2014 (he was at high scool). He followed radiotherapy + two years a chemotherapy (Temodal, also called Temozolomide). The treatment stopped in October 2016 after the showing positive result (tumor size and its activity). 

My son just turned 18 in December 2016, and he was a 1st year medicine student. He worked so hard, I do not remember how many times I saw him crying in his room because of the immediate memory loss issues due to the tumor. We had no choice but to keep thinking positively, as if we will live forever. My son was so dedicated and determined since he was little kid. He has always been a wise child, I see him playing quietly on his Nintendo or Xbox for hours you can barely notice his presence, and at the same time, he has a natural presence and lot of charisma when he talks. His entire education was flawless, and we barely saw any negative sign of his adolescence.

I cannot describe this feeling, there are no schools to teach how to become a parent, and our first child taught us everything. I was an apprentice dad at 23 and a young graduate in engineering, my new life has been built around our son and daughter. I was deeply grateful, I was filled with happiness, I was lucky to have lovely wonderful parents, brother and sisters, wife and children. I have never been venal or opportunist; I have never felt the need to have lot of friends. We never used to get bored at home. One day our children asked us to get out for one to one romantic dinner; we ended up talking about them all the evening.

Beginning of 2017, the descent into the abyss started, the MRI showed that the tumor has recurred plus two other tumors. We immediately started a new chemotherapy protocol based on Avastin + Bellustine. All the medical professionals were supporting and encouraging us, they gave us the feeling that the situation is still under control. 

A week later, my son called me, in a suffering and weary voice “father, can you pick me up” he immediately hung up the phone. I knew something bad had happened. He sat in the car after I arrived, he was very pale, he said nothing, and after minutes of driving I heard, “I am going to die father”. These words chilled my blood, and still echo in my head today; I parked the car trying to understand. He told me that, while in the university classroom, that happens to be right next the hospital, his radiologist and his cancerologist summoned him. Due to the fact that he is an adult now (18 years and one week), they are compelled by law to tell their patient the truth, and the truth is that the Avastin + Bellustine protocol is a palliative treatment. The different tumors have reached a very advanced stage of development, which left him with only 2 to 3 months to live in the best scenario.

It was full of rage and bruised, why did they took him aside for such thing, we almost lived in that hospital for the past 4 years, why they changed their speech? why they’re protecting themselves by protocols, why are they so indifferent now? why didn't they call my son by his name anymore (they use the case number)? I have thousands of questions, but the most important is to talk to my son, there's no possible consolation words. I asked him to stop thinking, I told him that no one knows the future, that we need to continue our fight, I promised him to try every single possible thing.

**part2** (new edit)

The radiologist accepted to receive us. He was not that same affectionate or compassionate person. I was not ready to hear what he was going to tell us. “Doctor what about the experimental test we already subscribed to”, the Doctor replied curtly “Do it if you have money, do it for your conscience, it won’t change anything, there’s no time, your son will die”.  What about that other test in Germany, in the UK, in Switzerland, in the US, I had a pile of other great cancer centers we already contacted. “Doctor I do not care how much can this cost, I can sell anything I own, I can take a credit, please, I could have given him my life” The doctor stands up, shook my son hands, told us with an embarrassed smile that this was the last session he has with us and left the room. We called the cancerologists, we felt their panic, everyone just abandoned us, and we are alone.

The next day I called one of the other biggest Cancer center in Paris, the doctor’s answer was fast, knowing my son’s case (hospitals treat these kind of pathologies in national multidisciplinary teams
) “Sir, there’s no cure to Glioblastoma” I replied, and the hope, give us some hope. My son did his job without complaining, he followed all your protocols, and he trusted you, do your job please. I hated all doctors; I hated them for selling us fake protocols, fake drugs.

We are going to keep at it. We have no other choices. My son was certainly afraid and terrified, I do not know how to reassure him, he is in pain and I do not know how to relieve him.

We had some friends with Glioblastoma, they were long time survivors who considers Ben Williams as their messiah, very used to non-conventional treatments. We continued the chemotherapy in addition to the metabolic treatment (followed by a doctor, alpha lipoic acid and calcium hydroxycitrate) + ketogenic diet we tried all the cocktails of Curcumma, Genistein, Mushrum, Green Tea, Omega 3 and Broswellia.

During 7 months, he worked harder. He was tired and fragile. He refused to miss a single lesson even under chemotherapies effects. It was my boy; his way to prove to the entire world how strong is he. He was fighting for his life and showing us his desire to live. He succeeded the first trimester exams, he was proud, we were so damn proud. 

On day, while driving him to the university I felt him exhausted, I explained that he should stay home; we can miss one lesson and comeback tomorrow, few minutes later, the first urinary incontinence incident happens, it was so uncomfortable and so hard for him to accept what happened. We came back home, he took a shower. I joined him in his room; he was lying on his bed, his eyes wide open.
We discussed for a long time, and I called the Cancer center, his doctor recommend us certain drugs, they were all inefficient, the only reasonable way was to use adult diapers.

Starting from this time, the situation escalates quickly.

**Second last part**

My daughter and my wife have always been there, they had a fusional relationship with our son. My daughter used to tell her brother about her whole day as soon as she got home from school; he was her guide, her landmark. I remember, while very young, my son wanted to help his sister by tidying up her room, she was not happy and stuck him in a corner of her room to yell at him, he was twice taller than her, he was just standing there and smiling.

We stopped our respective daily Jobs, his mom was working partially and I was working remotely, we was always at hope but we need full time dedication. We could not have imagined calling an ambulance for his chemo sessions. During the past 4 years, he always went with his mother or with me. We were so scared of everything. He kept his self-awareness/conscience until the end, he tried to help us, he often said to his mother ""do not worry it will be fine"" when he saw her worried.

He was getting weaker, his room was upstairs, the shower too, I took him in my arms like when he was still a baby, and we go up the stairs to give him the shower, we shaved our faces together and we laughed at the result many times.

He was getting weaker and weaker. He needed to take naps. He hated them when he was a little boy. One day while playing UNO cards, he was scared when he understood that he could no longer use his right hand, he was crying and he told me that it was difficult to explain. We knew and we avoided thinking about all the consequences of this Cancer since day one.

I didn’t want to hear anything, I’ll carry him in my arms for another 40 years if it’s necessary, I’ll be his hands, I’ll be his legs. I knew that if physical pain is there his inner suffering was immeasurable.

That morning, he gave me a first letter containing all his passwords, email, phone, and a second letter of attorney for his bank account. An account that we created for our children when they was born, in order to save for their driver’s license, their first car ... I never expected he can think about this, and I never slept from that day on.

Few days later, my son lost his voice, he could not speak anymore, and it was cruel. Until then we could at discuss, laugh, and even dream, but the cancer decided to take all that away from us, the cancer decided to isolate him. We managed to find a way to communicate using eyes ""yes"" ""no"" were easy signs, later we learned “tired” “sad” “stay” “leave me” ""I love you"" ""kisses"" and many others. We tried a tablet, but I still see the disappointment in both his and his mother eyes, we realized at that time that we will never be able to communicate as before. We missed his sweet voice, and we still.

Few days later, my son couldn’t swallow anything, his medicine, or even water, I called our family doctor who asked us to take him to the hospital, she took care of our children before they even went to kindergarten, she ran away, crying leaving her bag and jacket on the table.

At the hospital, we were told that there is nothing to do, that for physical and psychological pain require palliative cares that the team is made up of doctors from several disciplines, and they will help my son to suffer less. They told us that he will sleep longer and longer, and that one day he will leave. I hated them, how can someone dies in such a big hospital, how can someone dies surrounded by so many doctors. Some of you, who experienced the same thing, know that words cannot describe what you can live at that moment, tsunami of hate, pain, daze, fear, pity and I pass. It was not about my person; I was obsessed by the idea that whatever what my feeling is at that moment, my son is tetraplegic, he cannot speak, he is terrified, his life is in danger and I cannot help him.

A room was made for us next to my son's, we spent our days and nights there, we exchanged a lot of emotions, a lot of love. We tried to do some walking exercises, encouraged him to finish his yogurt, it was very difficult for him to swallow, he struggled to get to the last spoon. I was naively thinking that “maybe, maybe” he can recover some forces. 

When the nurses ask him to choose with who to take the sower with; he always choose me, he always look at me. I carry him, he helps me putting his arms around my neck, I install him on the shower trolley, I cover him, and we take the elevator to the shower room, he helps me to take his clothes of, I check water temperature, I try to explain him that I’m not crying it just the water splashed on me, we take the shower, I wipe it off with his towel, I give him his massage to avoid irritation. Now that he cannot move at all, he can have hematoma after saying long time in the same position in his bad or armchair.

 When he recognized his oncologists, the one who followed him the past four years, he turn his head, for him they had betrayed him, he did not fail but they do, he followed all their protocols, he traveled thousands of kilometers to take his chemo, he told them all his dreams, he wanted to be like them, a doctor, to cure other people.

That night my daughter had an anxiety attack, she felt that something is going to happen, she asked to go home, I went with her. Once at home I tried as best I could to reassure her and I went back to the hospital, at midnight her anxiety attack got worse, she called me, and I went back home to bring her back to the hospital. Anxiety attack was worst and worst and we decided with my wife that the best thing to do for now is that they both go home and they come back early in the morning, it was very hard for them to do so.

My son was sleeping soundly that night, I held his hand, I told him memories of his childhood, I prayed, I wet his lips.

My wife and daughter were going to come back that morning at 8:00 am. At 7:00 am my son's breathing was starting to get irregular, I knew that our biggest fear time is going to happen, I walked out of his room screaming ""come help us, please, he must not go now”. and I returned immediately to my son, I took him in my arms, I told him how much I love him, that his mother loves him that his sister love him, they both were with him all the time, I told him we are all proud of him, we are all grateful for all the happiness he has always given us, I apologized if I was not up to it, I to him that I will take care of his sister and his mom, I told him that he can fly away if he can no longer bear the pain, that neither me, nor his mom, nor his sister will blame him. He breathed his last, almost inaudible, my son has just left us. I was dazed again, I wanted the earth to swallow me up, I wanted to jump from the 7th floor, I wanted to die.

I don't know how long I was dazed, I was present and absent at the same time, it is 07:45, what am I going to be able to say to his mother, and her sister, I was not able to save him, the nurses didn't want to let me go, I said I could drive, I drove over 180k / h, I was afraid our two cars would cross and my wife, and my daughter would find out what just happened without me being there, I stopped halfway, I called her, ""honey, don't take the car please, our son left us, I'm coming home""

I got home, my daughter and my wife both dressed up, they were sitting on our son's bed, they were holding hands, they were silent, I told them our son is gone, my wife asked me the same question many times, “how’s our son going” I knew that she was going to collapse; and she did into my arms, my daughter was frozen, without any expression. I told them, I am sorry, I am so sorry, I failed.

They both insisted on going to see him one last time, I could not refuse to my wife, but I explained to my daughter that it is very difficult, she replied ""I know, you lost one of two Childs so you still have the another, I lost my unique brother, I lost everything ”.

He was lying on his bed, well dressed, pale and cold, his mother took him in her arms, her sister too, each of them spoke to him for a long time, and I stayed in the hallway consumed by pain.

My wife and daughter did more than me, during years, I was just telling my story, they have both suffered more then I.

Years ago, our daughter makes us many Brazilian bracelet; each of us makes a wish. When I was driving, back to home she started crying, the bracelet she made for her brother falls off by its own, her wish of her brother not suffering anymore just came true.",very-bad-dad,t3_hx1ewz,16,2020-07-24 13:04:16,29,hx1ewz

I'm a 23 year old man and ive been stripped of everything in the last 6 months. I went into hospital on February 13th with a swollen ball and wondering why I can't keep any food down. I was apparently in way worse condition then I thought even though I was still doing a very physical job up until a few days before that. It was in the emergency room when I first heard my diagnosis. I don't really remember that moment. The whole night doesn't seem real just like a bad nightmare. My memory gets very hazy from here, it took a few days before I got a room they didn't know if I was even going to make it the night. After I got a room it wasn't long before I was down in the ICU and that's where I spent the next 43 days losing an extra 30lbs getting tubes in me from everywhere. Down my throat into my stomach a chest tube. I had a fungal infection from round 1 of chemo and was in a coma for weeks where I had the most vivid unforgettable dreams. I ended up getting a trach after the tubes in my throat came out. Not being able to talk or move any part of your body after you've woken up in a strange room with tubes all attached to you is a truly terrifying time. After 56 days in hospital when I was finally free and good enough to walk with a walker. 

Learning to walk again wasn't that bad considering I'm young, round 4 of chemo was done as an out patient I'm lucky and didn't really have side effects from the last 3 rounds. Then 2 rounds of radiation for my brain. After that I had a seizure and now Im not allowed to drive anymore. 

Sorry for the ramble and bad writing but this is what I really needed to get off my chest, I had a phone call with a different dr in a different city this morning. I had to go over all this and more with her and she told me this is a stabilizing round of chemo before a high dose round and then a stem cell transplant with my own stem cells. I'm not afraid of that I've dealt with so much already. I'm scared of it not working which of course is always in the back of my mind but I try not to think about it. But she said this was the last thing they can do before they'll start treating it as a palliative case. I'm only 23....",WhiteWelds,t3_i5fhlj,7,2020-08-07 15:07:43,13,i5fhlj

My  mother was re-diagnosed with Cancer(Stage 4) in October of 2019. Her  first battle was in 2008 with Uterine Cancer, which was caught super  early. The new cancer emerged in a similar spot somehow, even after  removal of everything down there.

She  chose to end treatments this week. And is now under palliative/hospice  care at home. Which requires 24/7 care since she is unable to walk now.  With her decision to end treatments over the weekend, she was also  diagnosed with a blood infection. Which is causing even more pain in her  right leg, with poor circulation occurring. Which will most likely  require amputation. She must remain under heavy sedation to ease the  pain of the cancer growth.

The  state of Pennsylvania in which we live makes it illegal for a resident  to end life via ""assisted death/suicide"" by a physician. At what point  is enough, enough? She's admitted to my father that she is ready. It is  absolutely inhumane what she is now going through. I just hate feeling  so helpless.",The_Gielotine,t3_i8r6cf,5,2020-08-13 01:57:33,12,i8r6cf

Feeling immense anger and guilt,"Mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer back in June. She'd been feeling pain for some time but kept it to herself until it was too late. A biopsy later revealed it was breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones. The doctors gave her six months to live without treatment so Mom opted to start treatment right away, but due to poor health insurance, the current Covid epidemic, and the pitfalls of bureaucracy she didn't get into the hospital until over a month later.

Since her health was already deteriorating so fast she basically had lost the ability to walk on her own at this point. There was a tumor on her spine and the doctors said if she didn't have surgery to remove it soon that she would be paralyzed for the remainder of her life. She had a spinal fusion which went well and at this point we were all hopeful and talking about life after moving her back home to live with everyone.
Since time was of the essence and she and everyone in our family agreed that she wanted to pursue treatment, she was given hormone therapy and her first round of chemo within a week of her surgery. Unfortunately, a few days later she developed pneumonia. Shortly thereafter, she had developed sepsis and a host of other infections and was put on a ventilator. At this point the doctors were already recommending palliative care and taking her off the ventilator to ""die with dignity."" One by one her organs began to fail her. First her right lung collapsed. Then her kidney started failing.

And finally last night, I watched her die through a phone. For me, the worst part about this was that I couldn't be there for her in person. I live abroad in China, and do to the current epidemic I cannot come back here if I were to leave and go back to the States. I have a wife and family here, so I opted to stay with the hope that she would get better and I could visit next year. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. 

She kept her eyes open the whole night until she finally fell asleep. I looked into her eyes and could see that she wasn't ready to go. My family that was with her were doing their best to send her off peacefully, but I got a little frustrated that they just kept offering her platitudes about going in peace, like they were just waiting for her to die, when it was so clear that she didn't want to go yet.

In the aftermath, I'm feeling immense anger and guilt. Anger towards a medical system that I view as having failed her. If she had never opted for treatment and just gotten palliative care, it's likely that she would have had more time and wouldn't have had to spend her last weeks on a ventilator in so much suffering. Anger that we all trusted the doctors and yet she died within weeks of entering the hospital. I'm no doctor, but in hindsight it seems clear that she was too weak to start treatment and needed more time to recover from her surgery and really make an informed decision whether treatment was the best course of action. It feels like the whole situation was so rushed.

And of course, guilt that I wasn't there for her in her greatest time of need. I'm her only son, and when she needed me most I wasn't there for her. We only got to have one conversation while she could still speak, and it was so rushed and hectic. Thanks to China banning all foreigns apps, I could not communicate with her directly even with a VPN and had to rely on my Aunt who had WeChat to video with her. Even though I got to say goodbye and speak with her at the end, it still doesn't feel the same as a real conversation would have. I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for not going back to see her and hug her one last time. 

That's all I have to say. I don't have many friends so it helps to get these feelings off my chest anonymously. Having experienced this first hand, I empathize so much more now with everyone here as I've been reading your experiences these last couple months. Cancer is a scourge to mankind and there's no platitudes to ease the pain.",yorickhs,t3_ialdqd,17,2020-08-16 03:24:00,90,ialdqd

# Background

My mom, Elizabeth (or Ely for short), was diagnosed with cervical cancer in the summer of 2017. At the time, she seemed very positive about the diagnosis and it appeared as though treatment was ultimately effective. Celebration was short-lived, however, as my dad passed away in November of the same year.

Roughly two years later, completely out of nowhere, my mom's skin began to turn yellow. Of course, we figured it was some form of hepathitis, but having learned a lesson from my dad's reluctance to see a doctor and how that influenced his passing, mom immediately decided to visit the emergency room. After several attempts and re-attempts to be thoroughly examined—most of which were dismissed for whatever reason—she was able to secure a hospital bed and a full checkup. From this point on, the details started to get fuzzy, at least for me. In either case, we were told that they had found some unknown object obstructing her bile ducts, hence the jaundice. This was in October of 2019.

Owing to the lack of details that I mentioned earlier, as well as my complete lack of knowledge about medicine, I didn't understand exactly what would happen moving forward. At first, I figured that they'd just ""go in there with a wire"" and ""pluck the thing out"", but it eventually dawned on me that mom would be going into major surgery—an intervention that I later learned is called a ""Whipple procedure"". The surgery was a success, mom seemed to be recovering surprisingly quickly and after several weeks, she was finally back home. She was weak, she lost weight, but we were together and it seemed like the worst of it was over. It wasn't.

Shortly after Christmas, around January, mom was scheduled to begin chemotherapy. At this point, I had learned that the previously unknown object that was obstructing her bile ducts (now removed and analyzed) was a tumor. However, prognosis seemed positive and I continually received encouragement that seemed to indicate that mom would recover; for instance, she herself told me that this treatment would be ""curative"", even though she wasn't able to receive all of the intended compounds due to her pre-existing kidney problems. We endured the monthly sessions together, through the emergence of COVID-19 and all the worries that it brought about. By April, around the mid-point of treatment, we were notified that the tumors (note: plural) had shrunk ""a little bit"". Neither mom nor myself knew that there were any more of them present aside from the one that was removed by the Whipple procedure. These were vaguely described to reside somewhere in her chest. 

Eventually, we reached late June of 2020 and the end of chemo. Mom seemed to be doing okay and we awaited the results of her post-treatment scan, hoping for some good news. The results came back showing an impediment of the progression of the disease, which wasn't the full recovery that we of course had hoped for. News was bitter-sweet, but we kept telling ourselves that this was a ""net-positive"", and that any step away from a progression of growth or spread was a good one. Now we just needed to wait for the next treatment and remain hopeful, we thought. However, soon after receiving the news, mom's health started to decline.

At first, both mom and I figured that she was just experiencing side-effects of the treatment, which appeared to be corroborated in the regular contacts with her medical team. She had heartburn and felt that her stomach was irritated; she felt tired and had difficulty breathing; her legs began to swell, although this effect had also been observed post-surgery months before. Our little walks around the neighborhood became less and less frequent. She experienced a significant loss of appetite, and eventually, she was unable to use the bathroom properly. Her legs as well as her abdomen continued to swell, now causing her pain and limiting her mobility.

I wasn't sure how to act during these moments, which carried on until earlier this month of August. She was receiving home-deliveries of medicine, but nothing seemed to be helping. She stopped talking as much, needed me to do more things around the house, and slept more than usual. Part of me continued to believe that these were just complications from the chemo, and that I just needed to give her space. I didn't force her into conversation, I didn't pick her up to go take a short walk, and I allowed her to eat at her pace. Before long, she needed to be hospitalized. 

After this, things happened quickly. We continued to keep our morale up even as they started to drain pints of fluid out of her lungs. Her kidneys were failing, which was more or less expected, but after managing to stabilize her values in just a few days, the hospital decided that she was ready to return home. She seemed to feel a bit better and we continued to wait for her medicines to work, but within just a few days she had to be hospitalized once more—this time in a state of emergency, late at night. Roughly a week passed, and the house where we lived together began to feel very empty. Visitation to her ward was prohibited due to the pandemic, so we had to settle for daily phone calls. Despite being able to communicate in some form, I started to feel very lonely. I was just about to tell her that I missed her over text, when she called me. She calmly informed me that because of her poor kidney health, treatment for her cancer would no longer be an option. This was only last Wednesday, on the 12th of August 2020.

I cried a lot, both over the phone as well as after the call had ended. My older sister called me soon afterward and we cried together. We immediately made plans to visit mom as the hospital allowed an exception for our case, which incidentally led to my first trip using public transport in months due to my fear of bringing COVID into the house. Mom looked a bit better than she had at home, and the three of us talked at length about the future, about everything that we wouldn't be able to do ever again and so forth. My sister and I were on a rollercoaster of emotions, crying over the bad news for one moment and in the next, feeling appreciation for the fact that we could at least be in the same room together. Mom remained calm and supportive. She had made many big arrangements for our future in spite of her exhaustion, which felt reassuring. But wasn't it all a bit too soon? We hadn't even received word on how long we could expect for her to stay with us. Did she know something that we didn't? I spent the rest of the day in a zombie-like state, barely managing to eat before falling asleep.

The next day, she was moved to a new hospital, ""where grandmother had spent her last few weeks"", she explained. My sister, who recently began working in medicine, informed me that this hospital specialized in ""palliative care"". I had never heard the term before then. I spent the next couple of days in constant emotional pain, crying over the phone and worrying about visitation. We were allowed ONE visit per week, I was told, which was obviously far too restrictive given that I wanted to be with her all the time. That same Thursday night was rough on her, I was informed, so her doctor felt that raising visitation to twice a week was justified. The happiness that I felt was only limited by the figurative punch to the gut that came with it; on one hand, I could see mom more often, but on the other, she was getting worse. Nevertheless, by the end of Friday, I experienced a rush of positivity and wrote to mom at length about how I didn't want to spend her last time on Earth mourning her prematurely, about how I wanted to make our final time as happy as possible, and that we might even be together for months to come. She was ecstatic, telling me that this was exactly the conclusion that she wanted me to reach. My sister and I had booked a visit for Saturday earlier that day, so I went to bed feeling excited and a bit relieved.

Saturday was the best day I'd had in months. When my sister and I entered mom's room, she was cheerful and energetic. She was herself. Her eyebrows had grown back a bit more, her legs looked less swollen and she sounded so happy and excited to see us. We talked as a family for the first time in a while, and forgot about everything bad that was happening. My sister had to leave early, but I stayed with mom for at least another hour. This time, we didn't speak about an end to things, but rather about the beginning of a new phase that we'd be able to remember fondly. When it was time for lunch and I had noticed her looking very sleepy for the past little while, we decided that it was time to part. It was a quick goodbye, and I went home relieved, having scheduled another visit for Tuesday. Shortly after getting back home, I wrote mom a message about how happy I was feeling to have seen her. She never read it. Regardless, sleep came easy that night. I finally felt some hope that things might get better before they'd get worse.

# Goodbye

Yesterday, I wake up to a phone call at 1AM. Through some miracle, I had forgotten to put my phone into airplane-mode as I always do, and even though it was still on ""silent"", I was alerted by the light of the screen. ""We need to go to mom. She's gotten worse."", says my sister in a shaky voice. I lose all presence of mind, quickly get dressed and call a taxi. My mind is a blur. But it can't be that bad, right? It's only been a day since our last visit, after all.

I'm escorted to mom's room by one of her nurses. As we walk through the hallway, I'm informed that mom is having trouble breathing, but she's sedated and is on a constant stream of painkillers. Upon entering her room, I can hear my dear mom's rhattled breaths. She appears to be asleep. The nurse calls out to her, and mom opens her eyes only slightly. She can hear us. I stay with her alone for a time, holding her hand and talking to her. I want to believe that she's going to wake up again, but I talk to her as if this might be our final conversation. I tell her that I love her, and that she can't leave us yet. I tell her that I would miss her enormously, and that I don't know how I'd continue going on without her. The nurse returns. ""She's going to wake up, right?"", I ask. The nurse doesn't know.

My sister arrives, and we talk to mom together. Sometimes she squeezes our hands lightly or moves her feet. Rarely, she moves her mouth as if to respond or nods or shakes her head lightly. My sister asks the exact same question to the nurse as I did. ""I don't think so"", the nurse replies this time. We tell our dear mother everything that we think she needs to know. We tell her that she's loved, and that we'll never leave her side. She's going to see grandmother, my dad and her three brothers again. My sister and I feel weak right now, but for our strong and brave mother's sake, we're going to persevere and find the strength to move on. That's what we tell her.

Eventually, she becomes less responsive. Her breathing slows. We watch her in silence for a few moments, and then come those few, final, strained breaths. Then a wheeze. Finally, her head falls onto her shoulder, and a clear red liquid runs out of the side of her mouth. It's horrifying, and I'll never forget the smell. My sister panics and grabs mom, repeating ""No, no, no!"". I immediately rise and begin to mash the alarm button for the nurse, running out of the room to check if anyone's responding. Soon, a team of nurses rush inside the room to catch the flow of fluid from her mouth with tissue paper. I know what's going on, but my sister is still calling for mom not to leave us. I hug her tight and try to calm her down.

We're moved to an adjacent room while the nurses arrange mom into a more peaceful state. I'm emotionless, pacing around back and forth while my sister sits down by a table in the middle of the room. I can't believe this is happening. Neither of us can believe that this just happened to our beloved mom, who had been so sprightly and clear-headed just the day before. It's now Sunday, August 16th 2020 at 4AM and our mom is gone. She was supposed to have months, we thought. She was supposed to see the end of this terrible pandemic; she was supposed to celebrate Christmas, and her birthday. We were supposed to prepare for the end together. We were supposed to *be* together.

After a short while, we return to mom's room. I break down. She looks just like dad did—hollow and sunken, like everything that made her Elizabeth, our beautiful angel, has left her body. We stay with her for a long time, holding her hands and trying to understand what had just happened. I read a few informational pamphlets that we're given by the nurse and then half-sleep in the chair for some time before our older cousin arrives. It pains me to see her reaction, as my mom was like a second mom to her. We stay for some time longer, and talk, process, arrange. By 8AM, we say our final goodbyes. I lightly hug my mom, tell her ""Farewell"", break down again and then we leave. For the whole trip home, the three of us barely speak a sentence to one another. We're exhausted. We decide to all come back to the house where I lived with mom—our family home where my sister and I grew up, and the house where my cousin had lived for 2 years after arriving from abroad. It's a different house now.

Today is Monday. I spent yesterday evening alone, trying to lose myself in my interests and listening to my favorite podcast just to hear the voices of happy people enjoying their time together. I woke up today—alone—in this big, empty, deathly silent house. The house that looks as though mom never left it, as though she might walk out of the bathroom at any moment, or descend down those stairs, so we could continue our life together as if nothing had ever happened. I can't yet bring myself to make any rearrangements. I can't yet bring myself to look inside her bedroom. She was my number 1, my best friend and the best mother I could ever ask for, and she's never coming back. I feel this permanent brain fog, and everything that I do seems to take twice as long as usual. My daily schedule's a mess. There's so much that has to be done, so many things that need to be planned and executed. I think I'm still in a state of shock.

But I'll be fine. So many people have stretched out a helping hand, both emotionally and with respect to practical elements. Mom diligently and fearlessly made as many arrangements as she could to give us all a financial cushion on which to rest for a time. My sister and I have each other, and the continual support and presence of our cousin. We'll all make it through this, but it's a matter of accepting a new normal. It's a matter of formulating new goals, new reasons to keep going and to forge new relationships that may slowly start to fill the immense void that's been opened up in my heart.

This is the part that gets the waterworks going. Goodbye, my dear, sweet, wonderful mother. You fought so hard, and you did it all for everyone else, like you always did. You were the most compassionate and loving person I have ever known, and you always did your utmost for us, your children—even if it wore you too thin sometimes. You were stronger than I will probably ever know, and I can only hope that at least some of that strength has been passed on to me. I know you wanted to see everyone who has left us in the past 5 years, and now you're finally able to. I just hope that you can somehow stay a little longer on this side, to watch over us and keep us safe. I love you more than I could have ever described in words, and I hope that wherever you are, you know that. As long as I live, I will never forget you. Farewell, *tenshi*, my angel.",King_Hoob,t3_ibcb32,4,2020-08-17 11:23:51,15,ibcb32

It's spread to both lungs, and my dad is having difficulties breathing. He can still walk, and still has somewhat of an appetite. English isn't his first language, and I normally go to doctor visits with him.

He was diagnosed last year in April, and since then he's had countless chemo, and radiation treatments. He had brain surgery last year in December, and the doctors were surprised with how fast he recovered. Things were looking up for a bit. He had hopw. Then he was put on immunotherapy, which didn't work.

 From July of this year, he's gotten progressively worse. Yesterday was the first time  visiting palliative care dr. The thing is, he doesn't understand that its the end of the road treatment. I think that both him and my mum know that the cancer is incurable, but they still hold onto the hope. They think that palliative care is just another treatment to help decrease the size of cancer. When they asked me, I said it was just a doctor who prescribed medicine. I can't bring myself to tell them.

My dad's still undergoing chemo as a last ditch effort to decrease the rate the tumours are growing. How do I tell him that the doctors are nearly giving up? I tried to suggest him get his affairs in order. Write a will maybe. He just said that he wants to wait until he gets better. I'm not sure if he'll get better than this.

He wants to fight, and I want to see him fight.. but it's a loosing battle. I don't know what he would do if I told him this .",Grave_Rabbit,t3_ig3dfp,12,2020-08-25 02:22:31,4,ig3dfp

As a background - My dad has been chronically ill literally my entire life with ulcerative colitis, then also made more ill by all the side effects that come from the steroids and medications he's used over the years to manage his condition. He got this persistent cough back in May that just wouldn't go, alongside a bunch of other symptoms. We thought it could be anything - allergies, a reaction to the wood he was cutting while working on our house extension, side effects of his meds. So he tried to self medicate (as he was scared of the doctors treating him like a COVID patient rather than listen to his actual issues) and while it did improve it still never went. 

Cut to now, he went downhill suddenly since Thursday last week, and come this Monday morning the paramedics are in the house taking him away for chest pain, breathlessness, inability to function, he had to stop several times being walked out to the ambulance. Hospital X-rayed him and found blood clots all through his lungs.Then the CT scan showed his bowel area and part of one lung lit up like a Christmas tree. Stage four bowel cancer that's spread to the lungs.

Our outlook is not good at all. Chemo and other therapies is an option available, but he's opting for palliative care. He's having a biopsy done today so we can get a more accurate timescale but nothing I've been googling to try and prepare myself is optimistic. We've had previous experience of cancer with my grandad back in 2012-2014, all the medical staff are acting the exact same ways as back then when his outlook was poor. I haven't been able to see my dad in the hospital due to COVID restrictions, and I'm terrified to see him as is once he's home. My mum said he wants to hear from me (via text) but what can I say to him? My mind is a total blank.

I'm only 21, he's 54. My mum and I are devastated. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore. We know to sort out the finances, his affairs and wishes and everything, that's not the problem. It's emotional. I feel lost and scared. I can't believe this has happened. I won't have a dad likely within the next couple of years and my life hasn't even begun yet. 

I know we have to keep on going and keep moving forward and we will! He has so many things he wants to do and experience with us while / if he can! But I just feel so so empty and sad and hopeless. I feel like I've turned into a little kid again. 

How did you do it? How do you cope with this? We're based in the UK, so what resources should we be looking at for support?

Thank you so much for your time",GunslingerHunter,t3_iguw5j,5,2020-08-26 08:07:08,9,iguw5j

I'm a 38 year old female. Four years ago I had adenoid cystic carcinoma of my right sub-mandibular salivary gland. It was removed surgically and then I had 33 rounds of radiation to my neck and jaw. It was horrible. I had to wear a hard plastic mask covering my entire face, strapping my head down to a plank during the radiation. I lost 60 pounds. My mouth and throat were full of blood, blisters, and pus. I could not eat. My gums swelled up, my jaw locked so that I could not open my mouth, and I coughed up bloody mucus all day. It was absolutely horrible. I was given IV fluids for hours, daily, after radiation therapy starting about 3 weeks into it. They literally gave me any pain medicine I asked for.  They wanted to give me a feeding tube but I wouldn't allow it. I would put rolls of quarters in my pockets to try to weigh more on the scale during appointments. 


So that was 4 years ago. I've always had a bit of lingering pain in my jaw, neck, and on that nerve that runs from my neck up to my ear, but I just managed it with tylenol. Last year the pain got bad enough that my doctors began putting me on various pain meds. When this didn't help I began seeing a pain specialist at a palliative care/geriatric pain center. Currently I take two narcotic pain medications (that I hate having to take), two anxiety meds for PTSD from my experience with the radiation, and I have medical marijuana. My pain is never ending. The medicines I take barely touch the pain. They take the edge off just enough for me to function. My doctors always offer me stronger medications, but I'm youngish and I have 5 children and I cannot spend my days doped up on the couch. The longer I get from when I had cancer, the worse the pain becomes. I have seen 3 doctors and 2 nurse practitioners, and the consensus is that my pain is from intense damage from the radiation, and I will probably have it the rest of my life. I've made my peace with that, but I have trouble with how it keeps getting worse. It's very intense pain, on my entire right side of my head now, but mostly my jaw and the nerves running up my neck and into my ear. It's exhausting and demoralizing.
So this is my life now. Has anyone else had an experience like mine? My cancer is super rare, and there is a huge chance of it coming back. When I die it will probably be from this cancer. Whatever, you know? But my god this pain. Is this what I have to look forward to? What happens if it gets bad enough to keep me from getting out of bed in the morning? Anyways, I'm just looking for anyone who has had similar experiences. Thank you for reading. I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry if there are a ton of errors.",ickynicky1014,t3_irnro4,3,2020-09-13 00:02:45,2,irnro4

/r/cancer/comments/ivby0k/metastatic_breast_cancer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/ivby0k/metastatic_breast_cancer/,cancer,t5_2qixx,Metastatic Breast Cancer,"Hi! Cassidy here.

I am a 26-year-old originally from Ontario, Canada, recently moved to Quebec with my boyfriend and mother in tow.

March 16th, 2020, my mom was diagnosed in the ER with Metastatic breast cancer, spread to her lungs, spine, pelvis, ribs, neck, and the lining of her brain. It was a shock diagnosis, but not really at the same time.

I have spent years caring for her in different ways with her PTSD and depression issues. She tends to refuse help from most doctors, or at least, the preventative care required to avoid problems from getting worse. The reason I bring this up is that I almost felt caring for her in this sense would be my inevitable future, and I feel as though I grieved the women my mother once was, many years ago.

My mother raised me and my brother as a mostly single parent. My absentee father spent the majority of his time working hours away, and only coming home on weekends to clean the pool and see his friends. She did a wonderful job given the circumstances, and when my parents inevitably divorced, I chose to stay with her full time. She has been my rock growing up, always proud, always boastful. She is kind and caring, and incredibly selfless with her children. I always imagined my adult life littered with phone calls for advice on my marriage and how to raise my own children right, and then I was hit with this diagnosis.

The last five months have been nothing short of life-changing. I have limited support from my brother, as he is busy co-parenting with his ex-wife and working full-time as a Police Officer during a global pandemic. I try not to blame him for his lack of availability and willingness to help, but I can openly admit that I feel frustrated at him for not doing more.

Upon diagnosis, we had a rough initial week. My mom has lived alone for years, about 15 minutes away from me. I took her home from the hospital that night with a pharmacy of her own to get her pain under control, some food for a few days, and a long list of phone numbers to get started making appointments. I quickly realized this would continue on for what she has left of her life, for me to handle.

That week was littered with scans, new doctors, and hours of driving to Newmarket to begin talking treatment plan. I think the stress got to her, and a few days were spent hopping in an ambulance to the hospital as she was in so much pain she could not wait for me to drive her.

She was diagnosed with stage 4, with limited options for treatment aside from pain control a hormone-blocking drug to slow the growth of the cancer cells. She was given access to a palliative care doctor to help manage her pain, which to say the least, I have not been impressed with. Although the doctor puts on a polite facade, she seems to ignore the things that to me, are signs of the end of life and I am left feeling like I have no resources and no options.

As I am her legal caregiver, my only option was to have her move with me to QC as she has no one else to assist, and I had already signed my mortgage prior to her diagnosis. I held the move off as long as possible, to ensure she could benefit from as much treatment in ON as possible before we got here.

None of her doctors will give us a time frame, but my research shows that that cancer in the lining of her brain is an end-stage progression, and we most likely will not see more than a year. Her doctors, on the other hand, seem to believe that if she just stays in a positive mindset, she could see 2-10 years. Which to me is unrealistic given her condition.

I feel lost. I am 26, a first time home buyer, hoping to continue on with life as expected for someone my age, and I am struggling to do so given what I feel is science vs spirit. In recent days, she is very forgetful and confused, she has lost over 60 pounds, she sleeps 12-18 hours a day, gets sick after most meals or snacks, and is so weak she can barely make it up the stairs.

Trying to cope with the diagnoses, and the harsh reality of losing my mom before she gets to see me get married or have children is crushing, but the unknown of what to look for, when to put her in hospice, and who to talk to makes it much worse. I find myself battling emotions of anger and frustration vs. happiness and joy to spend these last moments with her. The unknown is killing me.",CassTonkin,t3_ivby0k,10,2020-09-18 18:43:59,16,ivby0k

I immediately brought her home to Ohio, which she barely survived the trip. She went right to the ICU, and she was unable to make medical decisions for herself. I consent for them to start the chemo since she had expressed the desire to give it a couple of rounds at least. She improved after the first dose, for about 3-4 days. Then she slowly started to decline. Couldn’t breathe without the bipap. Needed to be sedated and restrained again. Thrush from the chemo, lost her swallow reflex, becoming less aware and more confused. Palliative care called a family meeting on Tuesday which was basically, if you want her to not die in this hospital and go to hospice, this is our window. In a few hours she won’t be able to transport there. So I signed the DNR papers. Rode with her over to hospice. She was in and out, but her family was there with her. My estranged brother showed up and made peace. The nurse broke the rules to let my 6 month old in to give her Mimi one last drooly kiss. Then we had to go, visiting hours were over. She made it through the night comfortably, but never woke up in the morning. I spent the day with her and loving on her best I could. My late father made his presence known. He was waiting for her. She waited for me to leave, and for the minister to pray with her, and that’s when she passed. There was no pain or fear anymore. 

I have a million emotions right now. Sadness, anxiety, fear, anger, numbness. I had twenty extra years with my mom and it still wasn’t enough. It happened so fast.",disclaimer_necessary,t3_iyzfw2,9,2020-09-24 15:33:51,25,iyzfw2

What should I be doing?,"My dad was diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer with small metastasis to his lungs and some on his spine. He’s 60 years old. Due to the aggressive nature it’s automatically stage IV at diagnosis. 

My two younger brothers and I live 10+ hours away. We all took two weeks off around his diagnosis to spend some family time at home, with was punctuated by his immediate start of chemo/radiation every day until mid October. We’re all now back at work and just waiting to see what the end of therapy brings. 

His tumor was determined to be inoperable. Especially with this aggressive cancer, they worry about missing some, so they elected to do chemo/radiation instead. His doctors have been extremely cagey as to whether they would ever recommend surgery. It’s my understanding that if they do not do surgery, most of his treatment will be palliative from here on out. They have not fully communicated this to us, but my understanding based on the literature is that his chance of survival over the next year is low, and survival beyond 5 years is nearly nonexistent. 

I’m at a complete loss for what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m the oldest sibling in the family, and my mom is a mess (rightfully so). They are in a good routine now driving ~3 hrs round trip for his treatment. My 3 uncles are planning to make trips out to my parents’ house in the coming weeks. Everyone is turning to myself and my younger brother for guidance. My parents need help with anything tech based, so online insurance, appointments, etc we’ve been trying to help with. My uncles don’t want to overstep and so they’re constantly asking us what’s appropriate to do, when to call, when to visit, etc. 

I have a few questions about what I should be doing.

1. Visiting. I’m worried that we are squandering time with my dad while he’s still mobile and coherent by being back at work. I think all of us visiting last month was overwhelming for my mom but also a welcome distraction. I’m worried about upsetting their routine, and wont be able to go with them to treatment due to the pandemic. They say they are doing fine being alone, and don’t want to burden everyone, but I still worry. Should I be thinking about taking leave from work and just going up there to be with them? I talk to them on the phone multiple times a week, and my dad isn’t always up for talking because he’s extremely sore. 

2. Finances. This has been extremely uncomfortable for us to talk about. It seems shallow and inappropriate at this stage. Nonetheless, My uncles are all very financially minded and want to make sure our family is taken care of, and they have a lot of questions for me that I just can’t answer. My dad is a business owner with multiple disability and life insurance policies to protect his and his partner’s interests should something like this happen. He also has a life insurance policy. The person in charge of my parents’ finances seems to have everything in order, but I don’t know if there are certain things that I’m supposed to be doing that I have no idea about.

3. Grandchildren. My parents have now for the better part of a decade communicated that they would love nothing more than to be grandparents. My wife and I are currently in the early stages of trying, as our lives up until this point have been chaos (she’s a medical resident, I’m in the 5th year of my PhD program). One of my biggest personal regrets in all of this is that my dad may never meet our children, never get a chance to be a grandpa, and that’s the most painful thing for me, because I feel responsible for that as the oldest. 

4. My personal relationship with my father. My father and I have gotten along fine. Over the past decade, we’ve had a few rough spots regarding money and politics. There were a few indications when we were visiting last month that he may still be bitter about some of those things. I want him to know how much I appreciate everything he’s done for me as well as smooth things over even though it may seem like small potatoes right now. I feel like we’ve had many in-person conversations about this, where I tell him all of these things but we move on and it never hits home the way I’d like it to. I feel like he would appreciate it more if I did something like write him a letter, and maybe talk about grandkids too, I dont know. 

What am I missing? What should I be doing? I feel like a husk of a human being right now processing all of this, depressed and tired, trying to be positive, coping with family members and friends googling his prognosis, coping with heightened emotions, it’s a lot, and I never anticipated this.",Chahles88,t3_iz3kq4,3,2020-09-24 19:07:12,6,iz3kq4

I watched her decline over the last few weeks, all that practice becoming observant to any changes during her chemo made it hard not to notice all the things that happen when things go south.....

Stage 4 adenocarcenoma, metastasis to the brain. Radiotherapy didn’t work. Chemo, immuno, smart, targeted, all of that... may have killed what was in her lungs but I guess once it crosses into the brain, not much else to do without collateral. 

My father, sister, aunt and girlfriend were there with us at the end. We were all talking and joking as I lay next to my mom, then I noticed she had not taken a breath, not in 20-30 seconds or so. I watched her, counting the seconds, got to 60 and I felt something break inside me. Turned to look at my sister and she knew....

My mom always liked to be in a room full of life around her, she hated being alone. I know she loved me and felt safe with me, and I know that my warmth and embrace comforted her. 

Why do I feel guilty when I drove away from her plot that I abandoned her? I know she isn’t in pain any more, and I can’t fix anything or make her comfortable anymore but I still FEEL like she needs me. 

I handled all the paperwork for the family, handled the hospital papers, morgue papers, burial arrangements etc like I was a damn robot. I felt numb going through it until the moment I drove away....... 

I know I’m rambling, I feel like this is the only place I can talk about this. I’m not ready to talk to my family yet, or my girlfriend yet. I just feel like letting go will be hard.

I flew to the Middle East for my mom, and I fear that flying back to my home half way around the world will sink me into a hole because I left her in the ground so damn far away. 

Fuck cancer.

I've known from the April 2020 consultation with the oncologist palliative care would give him months instead of weeks. He lost mobility four weeks ago, I made a 911 call three weeks ago and he's been in the hospital since. A doctor spoke with his oncologist, that doctor today relayed the oncologist's opinion that he is no longer considered a candidate or chemotherapy--he  had chemotherapy from April to August, she spoke with me about her discussion with the oncologist, and that she had broken  the sad news to my husband that he is dying and had likely months left. 

I have never been in denial. I read his medical reports from his endoscopy in March, and wept. I've had some private weeping sessions and stress. When my husband was admitted to hospital in September 2020 I gently prompted him to consider planning for a worst-case scenario: power of attorney, final arrangements, last wishes although we were all hoping for the best.

He called me today, fuzzy-tongued, frantic and sobbing. I gently told him I and his mother, who had worked with a pancreatic cancer team at a hospital, had months of preparation and adjustment to this. I said that when he entered a calmer state of acceptance, we could work together to plan things according to his wishes. Every day I text him to ask how he is, so he can call me when he's awake and I'm not interrupting a procedure or examination or his sleep. I emailed him three questions a few weeks ago, he hadn't replied. I told him I would give him only a few questions at a time.

We have a young adult son who has some acceptance, I did not give him false hopes and fanciful expectations, but is now mourning, having heard his father crying to him, and is processing his feelings. Since early spring I had told my son once a month he might want to look into teen counseling, or cancer support helplines. I used a cancer support helpline when my mother was dying of cancer.

Questions: 

1. How do people evaluate hospices in a pandemic?
2. Has anyone had luck getting notaries public or lawyers to visit them in hospitals during this pandemic? I'm not sure how will updates and power of attorney document signings work in these strange days.
3. Do people have book recommendations on how surviving family members can console/support the cancer patient?
4. Do people have book recommendations for young people losing their parent to cancer?
5. Do hospital social workers talk to the surviving partner/parent/next-of-kin only, or do they make their expertise and resources available to other surviving family members?",ChristyOTwisty,t3_j1ls5e,6,2020-09-28 21:50:15,8,j1ls5e

My dad, early 70s, up till now in excellent health other than taking high blood pressure pills, started having back pain a few months ago; we thought it was sciatica from taking long drives to be with my mom. Despite PT and stretching and some medication, the pain wasn't improving so at the end of August, the spine doctor did an MRI....and the results came back that Dad had tumors all up and down his spine.

So began a journey of tests and doctors; I and my mother are RNs, and that almost makes it worse because we know too much :) Dad had a very early decline: early CT and MRI scans showed all his bones had extensive cancer lesions, a CT of the neck saw tumors on his neck going up into his brain, and the pain was terrible. When they finally met with an oncologist, he put Dad on more aggressive pain management (Fentanyl patch, Dilaudid and Oxycontin) but so far he's still miserable.

Nausea and vomiting are terrible. He has lost nearly 45 lbs in the last 4 months. His calcium levels were very high (not surprising because bone cancer). He's had to get IV fluids a couple times.

He had a PET scan on Monday and the contrast made him sick as a dog and he's been vomiting bile since then. 

Today he and Mom (well, he met with the doc; Mom was in the waiting room virtually watching the visit) met with the oncologist, who told them the diagnosis, that the cancer is aggressive, is in all his bones, and is terminal. He stated we could try some palliative chemo to try and relieve his symptoms and make him feel better, but he has made a referral to hospice.

Dad is a Vietnam veteran, Green Beret, barely ever been sick a day in his life, and this diagnosis hit us like a ton of bricks. I'm numb. I honestly don't know how much time he has left; he's receiving some anti calcium drugs in the MD office now to try and bring his calcium levels down and stop the nausea/vomiting/confusion, then Mom will have to explain to him what's going on.

They live in another state, and my sister lives there too. She's driving a few hours to Mom to be with her. I'm going to talk to my HR department about what types of leave are available for me.

I did a search on this forum for ""cancer of unknown primary"" and the threads were several years old, so if anyone has any more recent experience, I'd appreciate hearing it. Or you could send me virtual chocolate. That's always good.",maryofboston,t3_j3cdvu,3,2020-10-01 16:53:11,11,j3cdvu

Had surgery, chemo, all the stuff . She was mostly fine until June 2020 where it was detected that the cancer had quickly progressed to Stage IV. She's on palliative care now and honestly I feel the end is near. She's on morphine, has lost 25 kg in three months, is basically skin and bones and her legs are extremely swollen and she can't stand well. Mostly is sedated all day because she has panic attacks when awake. I know she is probably going to go soon but I don't want to see her in such distress. She's on antidepressants but they help little. She's also having tremors and has difficulty breathing despite having good oxygen saturation (98%). I think most of it is anxiety related but don't know how to help at all. She likes games so when she's lucid we talk about games and about our cat (who she adores) and also pray (she's turned back religious and despite being an atheist, I do believe it brings her comfort so I don't mind) but don't know how to help her more. Any suggestion would be appreciated. 

PD: I also worry for my mom, she's a doctor and she has been her main caretaker and today she looked so broken. Of course I feel extremely sad too but I worry it would be too much for my mom to bear.

Stage 4, not doing much treatment.","In sept 2018 my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. At the time of diagnosis he already had 13 bone mets. So we knew it was terminal from the get-go. However, he has two types of prostate cancer and we don't know how many of the mets are each type of cancer, the typical  adenocarcinoma prostate cancer, as well as small cell or neuroendocrine prostate cancer. They don't know which cancer is dominant or if they're about equal or what. The only way to know would be to biopsy his bone mets which he has no interest in doing. He doesn't really want to know how long he has to live anyway, and knowing which cancer is primary wouldn't impact his treatment choices so it just seemed pointless to do a bone biopsy. 

He took Casodex, a hormone medication for about 8 months before his cancer learned how to continue to grow despite it. He then switched to zytiga, but at first they weren't sure if it was working, and then decided it wasn't working so they took him off that. 

From the beginning, they recommended regular chemotherapy for the small cell prostate cancer, but he has no interest in doing chemo so he has rejected that offer many times. He has done the hormone pills, he gets a hormone shot every 6 months (eligard or lupron), he is on a bone-strengthening shot, and he has done palliative radiation just to reduce pain in the most problematic spots. He also did iv radiation or internal radiation, once monthly infusions for six months, to reduce bone pain from the bone mets, but it's just for pain it doesn't do much to extend life. 

It's been 11 months now since he quit zytiga and about 4 months since his last IV radiation treatment. So the only actual cancer treatment he's doing is the shot which lowers his testosterone to try to slow the spread. If he were to have more pain he might consider doing traditional radiation in a particularly problematic spot. He's just trying to keep his quality of life as good as possible for whatever time he has left.

Next month is his six month check in with his main oncologist. He hasn't had bone scans or CT scans to check his cancer growth since least December. We assume at this appointment next month they might request scans. My dad has told me that he doesn't really want to do scans. He won't choose to do chemo or other treatments regardless of what the results are, he thinks knowing has potential to make him feel worse, or more anxious about the future, and has no chance of helping. 

So anyway..my question is, can we just refuse the scans? I'm no expert of course, but I feel strongly that my dad isn't in denial about the fact that he is dying. But he has always been an anxious person, and as far as knowing what mets he has or what is growing/spreading, etc, he finds 'ignorance is bliss' easier to cope with. Personally I am okay with him coping in that way. I just don't know if doctors would argue that he needs to know about growth/spread or if he can make that decision for himself.",Emmylu91,t3_j84l0i,4,2020-10-09 18:36:04,2,j84l0i

I wish you all the best.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer, which spread to his lungs, just three weeks ago. Consultants gave him 3-6 months and discharged him for palliative care at home. I live around 70 miles from my parents and managed to visit him on Tuesday of this week, where he was somewhat confused at times but mostly coherent. I sat with him, we talked and when it was time to go, we said we loved each other. It was lovely and although I didn't expect this to be the last time I saw him, I felt it provided everything we both needed.

&amp;#x200B;

That same day, shortly after I left, he began to decline significantly. He became restless, agitated, hallucinated a lot and completely stopped eating and drinking. He was fidgeting, his hands were twitching and he was moaning a lot, with very short and laboured breaths. He is unconscious most of the day, often with his eyes open, apart from a few moments where he would call my mothers name.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday (yesterday) the palliative nurse came to visit him and told my mother that he was likely to pass soon and I should travel back over to be with them both, which I did. Last night he had a bad night, was extremely restless and the medication was no longer working. The nurse agreed to change his medication to oxycodone and introduce a syringe driver, as they were coming out every few hours to inject him anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, he seems extremely relaxed, his breathing has improved. He is still not conscious and not drinking. His mouth is extremely dry. Overall, he doesn't seem in as much discomfort as he was last night though.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't get an ounce of sleep as I was listening out for him. The nurses were visiting every few hours. I feel drained and all of the emotion I have been keeping in seems to be pouring out. I can't even walk in the room to look at him as my memory of Tuesday was so positive and I don't want to ruin that. Everything I read says it is important to sit with your loved one but I just cannot do it. I'm frightened of seeing him as I know he has declined, even from just a few days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also pregnant and have picked up a cough/infection from the household, so the lack of sleep as well as the constant stress is starting to take its toll. I'm so anxious about everything right now - I feel terrible for my father, I want to care for my mother but juggling everything is just so hard. Part of me wants him to slip away quickly and part of me feels awful for feeling that way. This all came from nowhere and I just don't know how to handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

How long could we expect him to stay with us, with the above symptoms and fast decline? Is there any way things could improve? My mother keeps telling me to go home, be with my partner, catch up on sleep and come back when he has passed, but I don't want to leave her to manage this alone.

They were supposed to start chemo Friday and she was admitted to the hospital because of a fever and now they are getting any complications under control. The doctors are hopeful but it’s already been an overwhelming journey. We can’t go visit her. She’s trying to be too nice to her nurses and not asking for pain meds when she really needs them. 

Before her diagnoses she was in and out of the ER 5 times two weeks ago from vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. They kept sending her home saying she was stable. Until they finally realized what was wrong and did an emergent D&amp;C to stop the bleeding. She so bad at advocating for herself and taking care of herself. I had to fight for her life and it felt like no one was listening to me. Now with her in the hospital alone she’s texting me when she’s in pain instead of telling the nurses. 

We haven’t even started treatment and this is already too hard. Idk what to do. I feel so trapped living with my parents. I don’t know what’s safe to go do to get my mind off how overwhelming this all is. I don’t want to get her sick while she’s on chemo. I feel so trapped and freaked out and worried and alone and anxious.

UPDATE: she finally started chemo two days ago! They put in a stint for her kidneys to clear a blockage made by the tumor and are working on her constipation today. Once the kidney function improves they can start the other chemo as well that is more kidney taxing. They also started palliative care (not as part of hospice but just because she was in so much pain) and she is feeling so much better now! Thank you for all the support.

in this time they have been fucking about the cancer has spread further than before (it was in liver and gallbladder and a little in stomach, now it’s in further in the stomach more parts of the liver, the gallbladder, the bile duct, the pelvis and his testicles) i am so sick and tired of these people because it’s been an entire month and they still don’t even know what cancer it is. public healthcare system is a fucking joke.",KINGSAGAL,t3_k3yc98,9,2020-11-30 15:50:28,5,k3yc98

He’s just not there anymore and is in complete denial about what’s happening. He told me the other day he wants to buy a jeep to fix up when he feels better. He won’t let me involve hospice, etc.

Mets to bones which have left her essentially immobile (can transfer from her scooter to her chair/bed with help, and is still able to get to the toilet on her own). Also small growths on lungs that no one is worried about. Immunotherapy and radiation have failed her. She’s on a last ditch attempt TKI to halt the growth (which her onc says has a very slim chance of doing anything, but he is hopeful). She has had blood in her urine on and off, and her onc referred her for a cystoscopy. Orthopaedic surgeons have spoken to her onc to see whether it is appropriate for them to inject bone cement into one of her hips so she can at least weight her on it. I am guessing he gave them the go-ahead as they’ve been in contact and asked her to go for a scan. Her blood work was good.

She spent a week in palliative care while they try to sort out her pain management. While there, she had a second opinion Telehealth consult with an onc who is involved with kidney cancer trials. He said there is nothing more than can be done, her cancer is very aggressive. That day, she was badly affected by pain relief and felt really sick (she later vomited all night, they later found she had a UTI - she has a catheter so it was not obvious to her that there was a problem). He estimates she has months left based on how she appeared and said this is *only* a guess. Mum asked the question, which is the only reason why he gave her a guess. It’s not something he likes to do because he can’t be accurate.

The palliative care doctor at the hospital estimated weeks, and said she *should* make it to Christmas. She also recommended Mum stop the TKI because she doesn’t think it’s doing anything and she may get side effects (she’s had none so far). Mum wants to take it because she desperately wants more time, and it’s important to her to know she is doing all she can to fight this. She has 100% of our support no matter what she decides. She is home now, but is very depressed because she believes she only has weeks left. 

How can the palliative care doctor say this?! What is this timeline based on? They’ve not done any bloodwork or any scans while she’s been in the palliative care hospital. If her treating onc wants her to have a cystoscopy and gave the green light for the orthopaedic surgeons to see what they can do to improve her QOL, then he expects her to be around long enough to see some benefits from these interventions, right?

Watching my (F32) husband slowly dying and i feel scared and alone and angry &amp; like wer’ running out of time. Sorry long post, i just need to offload :(","We’re getting to the end of year 3 of this cancer situation. But since march/covid its sneakely getting worse. 

He has bile duct cancer with mets to liver , peritoneum &amp; local lymphnode . There’s nothing to offer or do, we’v tried it all. ( so please no suggestions re- treatment options, i think i just need to vent to you who truly understand ) 

Went abroad to my homecountry for treatment of and on over the past 2 years , went to germany for private treatment and spend all our savings, and managed to stop the lymphnodes growing but since covid &amp; no traveling + to risky for him he’s slowly doing worse. Every 3month’s scan there’s something new. First it was the new mets to peritoneum, then his liver, last week several new bits on his liver. 

Since march he’s had long hospital stays, stent fittings, mistery infections and mistery bleeds since march. 

We have good contact with the cancer ward &amp; oncologist, the gp ( docter) and the palliative team. Hell im even recieving counselling. ( my counselor is my little saviour, if it wasn’t for my weekly sessions with her i wouldnt know how i could hold on any longer without breaking down completly) .

I see him deteriourating infront of my eyes, my sweet beautiful husband. He is the love of my life. I left my mum and friends to move to his home country , then 4 years ago my mother suddenly got lung cancer and we flew over to stay with her and as an only child ( my father passed away off cancer when i was young) i moved in with her and died within a space of 4 months. Me and him looked after her untill she passed away. He tucked her in and gave her her hotwater bottles. He is the only one in this world i share these memories about mum with. Hes the only one that truly gets how it was . 

We were going to go for ivf treatment after i’d finish my degree that i went head into after mum died , but then he got diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma and had i to break off my study and job and slowly move into his business and help out. He’s had an 11 hour surgery at the start of his diagnose ( we got married 3 days before!! 12 years together though) and outcome with no clear margin unfortunatly. He’s been through so much. His poor poor body. 

Hes starting to look simulair as mum, the painmeds, the dizzy spells, the more and more sleeping , its killing me inside every second of every day. The signs of his liver not working properly anymore are slowly coming ( oncologist is aware, he gets weekly bloods &amp; check ups ) and im so scared for the next thing to come. For the next ‘fase’ . 

I can’t describe this feeling but its adrenaline for anything that could go wrong at any moment ( we had a few close calls over the past few months &amp; his docs have said he is to weak &amp; he has a no rescusitation advice in place ) mixed with just utter sadness of seeing the love of my life slowly wasting away. The realisation of not having a future together anymore has come. It is like we are stuck in some sort of time-less bubble.

He still has hope that he will stay stable for a long time, and when i chat to him i still feel that hope too, but when i’m alone i don’t . Its a horrible feeling that has seeped in, the hope for a miracle is slowly slipping when i am alone. All i see are signs that its nót going so well and that i really truly might actually are going to loose him. 
It breaks my heart he is still his ever lasting , sweet positive self and never complains even though he is in pain. I fucking hate this cancer so so much . 

I hate peoples reactions, im hiding from our friends atm, the questions, the texts, its to much . I know everyone means well but it drains the shit out of me. Im so fucking tired. The ‘update on scan’ chat groups, i copy paste so its not much work, but even that i have to force myself to do and dread everyones responses. 
Im not the same anymore. I’v changed into a miserable person that just feels hurt and deserted and angry at the world. Im not the same empathetic, bubbly arty girl i once was. 

I can’t stand opening social media and seeing ‘woo me’ posts about peoples stupid problems, or about them telling about their fucking grandma that was 98 and lived a long and healty life and how “ she had cancer too so they know what your going through “ . 

I think i feel jalousy when i see people that are way older then me &amp; still have both their parents, a large family , security of family around etc. Most my friends are having kids &amp; looking into houses at this stage of their lives. 

We have given everything over the past 3 years, so many treatments , trips back and forward to my country for complementairy treatments and every single day revolving around doing something to keep him as healthy, as loved and has cared for as possible. Im running a business that has never been mine and its a tiny business but never the less scary. We are in the process of finalising paperworks so if shit hits the fan things are easier to deal with, but its making all this horribly realistic. 

Its making me realise that there is a very big chance i am going to end up alone here, in our super rurol village away from our friends and my home country where my best friends are and i feel awfull for even letting those thoughts cross my mind :( like i am giving up on my husband :(
 Im not, i wont ever leave his side and im his bedside special sexy nurse and i will fight tooth and nail to keep him going for as long as he wants with whatever means we have got. 

I’v been a lurker on here for quite some time, but its 3 pm right now , my mind is racing and i just need to get this of my chest .

I am still ambulatory and can do ""most"" of my part of a 4 person household (kids are 19 &amp; 17).  Depending on the high/lows of fatigue, I can do some grocery shopping, some of the cooking, some tidying and help with paperwork and household finances.

I am currently on chemo and still intend to fight as much as I can but also recognize that the day is coming where fighting is losing battle.  My overarching goal is to stay out of the hospital for as long as possible.

I know that a day is approaching in which fatigue and pain will put me into a somewhat bed-bound state. At that point in our system I will have access to a number of types of equipment to help out.

Are there things I should be doing, buying, planning in order to maximize a home hospice arrangement to be practical? As an example I know that the bedrooms in our house have limited electrical power, and in the hot weather we have to be careful which TVs and portable AC units are on at the same time. If, as part of hospice, we get a powered adjustable bed, I wanted to know that we could use the bed and not cause additional problems .

We do have a portable AC so are hopeful we can manage my temperature even if we hit a hot spell.

Are there other ways we could make the room more practical to be ""stuck"" in for weeks or months?

I've ordered a rolling drawer that we can use to organize any dressings or other medical supplies to make it easier for caregivers (either family member or RN).

Other than that, ideas?

What are the thresholds for what can and cannot be managed in a home setting?
I assume that pain management orally or via transdermal patches could be handled from home, but I guess that IV medications are unlikely in the home setting?

I don't really want to think too much about toiletting but I guess there would a phase where I would independent but might need assistance to/from the toilet (might need a walker).  From there we proceed to in-bed pans or bed-side commode which I imagine mean much more caregiver involvement to help, help with personal cleanup as well as emptying and cleaning the equipment.

My wife and I still sleep in the same bed ... do split adjustable beds help? Any advice on how to give both partners the best sleep posible even while dealing with all this stuff?

I'm trying to figure out what efforts we can make to GREATLY reduce the chances that I spend my final days in the hospital. And therefore maximize my time that I can visit with friends and family (with lots of appropriate cautions for Covid).

Any and all input welcomed! Stories of how you managed, or cases where ""best laid plans went awry"" are welcome too. Suggestions for helpful gear (for example I want to order a decent rolling desk to be able write documents while still being in bed).

The doctors started him on steriods (Dexamethasone) to reduce swelling and he just completed 5 days of radiation yesterday. 

Whole brain radiation therapy for brain metastasis is a form of palliative care treatment to help give some additional time. He may only have up to a few months to live. I'm devastated as is he. He's been crying alot and having anxiety. 

He is being discharged from hospital on Monday and he has asked to if he can come stay with me until he is feeling more confident to go home. He lives by himself. I said he is more than welcome to come stay with me.

I know in my heart he most likely not be able to go home because he is very weak and has lost 29.5kg. He now has a walking stick to help him.

My Mom, my best friend, my soulmate was diagnosed with stage iv anal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) completely unexpectedly. She had been losing weight for two years, but we chalked it up to her increased exercise. Seven months ago she began experiencing incontractible UTI’s. Five months ago she began experiencing rectal bleeding with bowel movements, and the doctors chalked it up to hemorrhoids. 22 months ago she had a clean colonoscopy. Now, she has an 8cm primary tumor extending distally from her anal verge, iliac lymph node involvement, and liver mets. No history of abnormal paps. One sexual partner for the last 35 years. Former smoker. The devastation we are experiencing cannot be articulated with human language. I know that you all know this feeling. 

She has been undergoing radiation 5x a week, and chemo once a week. She is also in palliative care. We haven’t really discussed a prognosis, but her tumors are shrinking. I know the statistics, and I waver between relentless hope and realistic fear that I will lose her to this horrendous disease. Treatment has been utterly brutal. All cancer is horrific, but there is a certain loss of dignity with disease that affects this area of your body, and that has compounded her incredible physical and emotional pain. 

Sometimes I am just numb. But, driving home from work at the hospital every day I often find myself screaming into the abyss at the top of my lungs, asking God why and how this could be happening to MY mother, MY rock, the greatest person I will ever know. I wonder how the world can continue spinning when mine has utterly come to a halt. My soul feels like it has been ripped from my physical body and shredded. I take care of cancer patients every day, and the reality of this disease is something I know all too well. I maintain my composure with my patients, and my heart always breaks for them... but now I can empathize with them in a way that I never thought I would be able to. The world is spinning around me, others’ devastating stories intertwining transiently with my own; yet I cannot wrap my mind around my pain, and cannot accept this reality. 

How in the ever-loving hell am I supposed to survive this? I would give anything; my life, to take this from her. Yet I cannot. We are left to watch her suffer, while utterly helpless. Clinging to hope one moment, and anticipatorily grieving the next. And she is but one story in a sea of millions, yet forever will be the center of my universe. 

I want to scream from the mountain tops, begging the world for prayer. For a moment of silence for my Mom. I know you all feel this, and my heart bleeds for you too. I want her to live. I am only 25, and I need her. My disabled brother needs her. This world needs her light and her love. But our bodies are faulty vessels, and I know well that our spirit transcends them, before and after our experience on this Earth. But we are helplessly enslaved to our human emotions, and My God, this pain is too much. 

Thank you for reading this post. I hope this is the appropriate place. Please know that I am happy to speak with any of you, and I ask humbly that you send a prayer or intentions for my Mom to the Universe. I will do the same for you. I am grateful for this community. 

One day at a time.

Since this fall I've been on palliative chemo and although I have yet to get a really candid, blunt assessment of my prognosis from my health care team, it is clear that my life expectancy is, give or take, a year.

I'm middle-class, middle-aged so I have a decent retirement fund that I won't grow old enough to use. Between that and my life insurance, I have no major worries about my wife and two grown daughters being able to cope financially. We live in a country with socialized medicine so a huge financial burden from my disease is not a worry.  So we have money we could spend.

A big part of my wife and I's retirement plans was going to be travel: places we have been before; places where one or the other has been but we'd share with the one who hadn't; exotic places (or even kind of mundane places) that neither of us has ever visited.   We've talked for years over many candle-lit dinners the places we would like to go.  Wherever you live, there's a good chance it was on at least one of the many trip itineraries we came up with.

So, naturally, now that I am facing death in the relative short term, my ""bucket list"" consists mainly of travel, and lots of it: foreign and domestic, by land, air and sea.

But, increasingly, it looks like COVID and its accompanying travel restrictions will outlast me. With the current lockdowns in our area, I can't even vicariously live through trips to restaurants or museums, let alone hop a plane for a long weekend in New York City or a week in Tuscany.

Anyone else dealing with this?  I know this is a ""first world problem "" but I feel really pissed off that the year I develop a terminal disease ends up being the year that the world practically shuts down.

Re-reading this I feel know that this sounds really entitled, so I'll understand if some of y'all roast me.  I know I am fortunate in many ways, but sometimes that is easy to overlook when I know I've got a year or so left before shuffling off this mortal coil.

Anyone else dealing with this? Found creative ideas to alleviate the aggravation? I'm open to other perspectives and ideas.",meisen99,t3_l95sbp,18,2021-01-31 05:43:37,51,l95sbp

But now the tables have turned and I’m not sure of what to do or where to go. I’m trying to find comfort while still providing it to my own family after this heartbreaking news.

My dad didn’t seem to want to talk about his diagnosis, but I can tell that he’s scared and hurting. My mother is distraught, she’s trying to be strong but I can see tears welling up in her eyes. My brother is very stoic, but I’m sure his mind is running a mile a minute. We were just told the diagnosis today and we’re already worrying about the prognosis, treatment/palliative care and insurance. I worry about the time we have left as a family. I worry about my mom and brother once my dad passes. 

It’s past midnight and I cannot sleep. I’ve been a crying mess all day. I feel like a horrible person when I cry out loud, “Why?! Why cancer in my family? It’s not fair”, and I know that’s not how it works. I’m sorry, just needed a space to vent my feelings...",keljoy25,t3_li6ye2,6,2021-02-12 08:29:33,13,li6ye2

I have done my own reading about this and it doesn't match what my mother says her doctor has told her. She says her is Stage 1, and she is now good to go.

How up-front are people with their social network about a dismal prognosis?

I have a GI cancer that from day 1 I understood the 5 year survival rate to be less than 10%.  Since then, various signs (surgery went well but had positive margins; high level of lymphatic involvement; recurrence of cancer after surgery and adjuvant chemo within 13 months; developing ascites) have pointed to me NOT being part of that 10% cohort.  I'm still doing OK (main problems are really a function of chemo, not cancer) but it continually seems I'm not fated to be one of the extra lucky ones. It seems like now it is a waiting game to see how long chemo can fight off cancer before I turn that corner into end-stage disease.

I can't get a really exact timeframe from my oncology team (which I totally understand).  Best estimate I've gotten is likely months, maybe as long as 18-24 but more likely under 1 year).  I keep waiting for the next image, the next exam to bring that number into more focus but so far it is still pretty vague.

I feel like I ""should"" be communicating more to people that my time is limited. I do tend to stress that I am on palliative not curative treatment and explain to people that this means they emphasize quality of life over curing the disease.  But, that still doesn't have the gravity of saying ""I've got a year left"" and I feel like people are going to tend to layer this on top of their personal experience, which for many of us (fortunately) is limited to a number of more common but more curable cancers.  I don't want to come across as this negative guy but at the same time Let people know that a ""cure"" is not likely for me. On the other hand, I don't want to manage people's expectations to a short time period and then feel wierd about outliving various guesses about how long I have.  Does that sound messed up?

Anyone else experience this?  Any thoughts on how you've handled it, both within your more intimate personal network like close family, as well as among a broader social network with whom you are communicating more broadly like via a blog or social media?

Thanks in advance... and fuck cancer.",meisen99,t3_lr32nf,23,2021-02-24 03:57:57,21,lr32nf

She knew as soon as I was strong enough I would protect her and the time came when I was 19 I was old enough to help her be strong enough to leave the abuse. 

She divorced my father and after a few years met her real soul mate, and settled down again with an absolutely lovely guy who I’m proud to say has been more of a father to me than my biological dad. 

We don’t live particularly close (around 1.3hrs drive) so we spent a lot of the last years talking on the phone and txting every day and visits when possible. The visits of which had to stop because of Covid. 

When I found out she had rectal/bowel cancer I was naturally devastated but I was filled with hope that she was only 67yrs old and fairly fit and healthy. I was sure they could treat it and I was praying every day that the time would come and she could call to say she was in remission and on the mend. 

She had intense radio therapy and a round of chemo therapy and started to really pick up. Her appetite came back and she was putting on weight again. Then she went to a follow up scan a couple months after, where they found the cancer had spread to her bladder and near her spine. Sadly they decided there was nothing more they could do and handed her over to palliative care team. 

Obviously she has been in agony, pain wise over the last year and now watching her suffer out her last few days has me shot through to shit. 

She’s at the point where she has a syringe driver on, so she’s either in extreme pain, so they increase the morphine/oxycodone or comfortable but not really with it. 

I’m absolutely devastated, to the point where I cry so much my heart hurts and feels like it’s going to burst. My brain is like cotton wool, people talk to me and my eyes are open but no ones home. It feels like, I’m Just a shell shocked body walking round with so much going on in my thoughts they become loud and noisy and I can’t escape it. It almost feels like I’m screaming in silence!

Why does end of life have to be so fucking cruel? If you or anyone, on end of life get told there is nothing you or they can do and it’s end of life, you should be offered assisted suicide drugs so that you can choose when it ends. 

Watching my mother drift in and out of consciousness and the cruel way she went right through the treatment for it to end up terminal has me convinced more then ever that end of life care should very much include self assisted suicide. 

TL:DR 
Mother on final days before death and rather than suffer the NHS should be allowed to help  by prescribe medicine that will end life rather than someone having to suffer incurable pain.",SirStalin_,t3_lu3n1r,22,2021-02-28 02:52:11,86,lu3n1r

About a year ago, she decided to go off the medicine because she wanted to ""heal the cancer herself"" (i.e. through herbal/scam artist cures).

At the beginning of January, she was in the hospital for about 1.5 weeks because they found blood clots in her lungs. They also drained a pleural effusion in both lungs at the same time (she had avoided getting treatment for it since August). They told her that since the pleural effusion was cancerous, she had 6-12 months to live.

Mom's always been deep in denial about her cancer, so this was fairly devastating for her. It's a major part of her identity to find ""cures"" for cancer and to try them out. When she got out of the hospital in January, she was doing very poorly - she threw up literally everything she ate (including water); she couldn't sleep; and at night she would get restless leg syndrome and wouldn't be able to stay in bed more than 5 minutes. She was on morphine every night from the pain in her back. She slept a lot. She found depression for the first time in her life. It was awful. I would hide in the bathroom and cry when she was sleeping.

Well, her partner was in the hospital about a week after she got out. He had sepsis. She was so afraid of being alone that she moved herself in with me. I don't normally live in the same city as my mom, but I came home for Christmas since I was starting a new job in January and they were letting me telework. I have been living in the condo my parents have been planning to move in to but haven't initiated due to health issues. 

Mom's decision to move into the condo unilaterally in January started the process that has now led them to separate. Because her partner has now been living alone for a month and he's worried about his health, he's initiated the process of moving into a nursing home. As part of that process, he wants to make certain he has the liquidity to pay for the nursing home (8K/month), so he's given us two months notice to evict from the family condo so he can sell it (as of a few days ago).

Not only is mom dealing with her cancer progressing, but now we also have to figure out how to manage the separation AND find a new place to live. Mom wants us to find a 2-bed so we can keep living together; I want her to go into a retirement home. My job contract is only until May and it's based in another city, where my friends and my personal belongings are. 

Housing is one issue to deal with, but then there's also my emotional state. Last month there was a lot of grief. But this month I'm just becoming deeply frustrated. Mom doesn't track her finances so she eats out a lot even though she can't really afford it. She has poor memory so she buys things without realizing what we already have, which both leads to financial issues and issues of waste. Mom also can't organize her things so she just ends up filling all available surfaces (partially I suspect because she can't remember what she has so she keeps everything out in the open). She's losing her ability to logic so she makes bad financial decisions - she just spent 2.5K on a care package from a cancer centre in Spain that promises to ""cure cancer"" in six months.

I feel like I'm turning into a mother. I am constantly checking - have you eaten breakfast? Have you taken a shower? Get off your card games and go get dressed. Stop playing cards and go eat some breakfast. If you're going to go to the health food store because there's a sale, check how much space we have in the pantry first before you buy new things. We have four cans of soup; no don't go and buy soup because it's on sale. We're going to bed, clean up your things. We're turning out the lights now, no you can't stay up on your computer, you have to go to bed. Mom doesn't like to eat leftovers so I either have to put leftovers in front of her or cook something new every day, which is exhausting, especially since she eats hardly anything.

And while I'm complaining, the condo only has one bed. When mom (unilaterally) made the decision to move herself into the condo, I gave her the bed - which means I've been sleeping on a yoga mat for the last month. The first few weeks were ok but I'm constantly exhausted because of how poorly I sleep.

There's just so many things to process. Mom has been accepted into palliative so at least we have a nurse visiting every Friday and checking on us, and I'm grateful that I have 3 friends in the city that are willing to meet up every so often. But I don't know how to manage cancer. I don't know how to be a caretaker. I don't know how to respect my mom and to set boundaries without treating her like a child. I don't know where we should live, whether we should live together, or whether she should live on her own.  If she goes into a retirement home, it's going to take at least 40% of my monthly salary but at least she'd be in a safe location with other seniors, recreational activities, two (different) meals a day, and people checking on her every day.

I would like to apologize because this post isn't gonna make a whole lot of chronological sense, and that's because i don't have the right information to make it so.

I am 23 years old, unemployed, just finished highschool, in a bad financial situation, and bad situation in general (house falling apart, gas got cut off for lack of payment, i have many untreated mental health issues).

Around 12 days ago i got the news that my mom has breast cancer. She's been sick for about a year now and due to very strained relationship with her, and her personality, she didn't tell me, nor did she tell anyone else, i had to find out because of my mom's friends desperately asking my mom's doctors for info.

She's had ascites, has been drained many times, and three days ago she got a CT scan done, she reacted badly to the contrast and spent all day throwing up what little she could eat and in immense stomach pain. She went to ER, they gave her morphine and now she's about to come back home.

Yesterday, when i went to visit her at the hospital, her doctor pulled me aside and told me that my mom's cancer has spread to other organs (she wasn't very specific and i was too nervous to even speak, so this is all i know for now) and that basically she could pass anytime.

I don't think my mom knows about this because this friday we (me, mom and brother) are going to have a meeting with the oncologist and psychologist, and she's going to be put into palliative care, so i assume the psychologist will tell her the news, but this is where i need help. I know it's only a few days away but my mom is an extremely cheerful, good spirited person, and that makes this situation more difficult, because seeing her so happy, having so much faith that she will recover, and me having to keep this horrible secret inside of me, is going to destroy me, it is destroying me already and i don't know what to do.

My mom might have done a lot of terrible things to me but i can say she's the only one of my parents i love (father passed away when i was a teenager) and since i suffered the death of my father so much, i can't imagine how i'm going to take my mother's death. I'm mostly afraid of suffering health issues because of it because i have such high anxiety and don't take the best care of my health, i don't know how i'm gonna make it, honestly.

Also, since i don't have a job and she gets little money, i'm afraid i won't be able to give her the best quality of life for her remaining days, i would like to give her so much more, but i can't at best assure she gets to eat everyday.

I'm so sorry about this post being a mess and my english not being the best,  hope you can forgive me but i just need to let this out.

Thank you for reading.",Mandy-Flowers,t3_m25tst,5,2021-03-10 19:14:36,60,m25tst

Living in a different country, I started to worry when the doctors ordered a CT scan and subsequently an MRI, without much communication about her condition. After days of waiting her oncologist finally broke the news that she had stage 4 cancer that had metastasized to the bone, causing innumerable lesions and six fractures along her spine. Two of her ribs had also suffered fractures, with a third one on its way. He immediately ordered a spinal biopsy to locate the primary. However, pathologists haven’t been able to do so (poorly differentiated) and it has been diagnosed as a cancer of unknown primary.

Covid made getting to her really difficult, but I made it here finally. Mom got very weak and blood results showed that she was unfit for more tests and also unfit for chemo or immunotherapy. She went once to radiotherapy. Her bone pain is getting worse by the day. She has been on a syringe driver (Fentanyl) for more than 3 weeks now.

However a week ago she suffered breakthrough pains so often that her palliative doctors ordered Ketamine and Midazolam to be administered through syringe drivers at 3 day intervals. She could finally sleep after the extra pain meds, but as soon as she got off it - hell. Her breathing is also impaired because of her ascites from liver cirrhosis. 2 days ago the fluid was drained and she is breathing much better now, we have also checked into a hospice where she is receiving better palliative care. By “we” I really mean that WE have checked into a hospice. I’m by moms bedside 12 hours a day. Home hospice was not an option extended to us, given how the tumors have eroded her core bones.

She seems much more herself these days but it’s really been up and down. One moment she’s laughing and joking but 5 minutes later she’s moaning in her sleep. It’s also really taken a toll on me and dad, both physically and emotionally. I love my mom so much and want her to be happy and pain-free for as long as possible, but at the same time it has also been really difficult not knowing when the inevitable will occur and when this horrible time will finally come to an end. I feel guilty for even thinking those thoughts.

Every day I wake up in shock realizing where I am and knowing that mom is at the hospice waiting for me to come to her. Either that or I wake up in shock from a text that she’s hurting somewhere. Lack of sleep has also been causing really dry and painful eyes, making the day-to-day routine difficult. How did everyone deal with the uncertainty of not knowing how much time is left exactly?

I really need to be present and strong for mom right now so she has all the assurance she needs, but I feel myself really breaking down.",louisekath,t3_m3korm,7,2021-03-12 16:05:47,15,m3korm

My mum is in final stages of her uterine cancer we are no longer having any chemo it’s just palliative care . 

On her second (and last ) chemo cycle she reacted very badly and had a UTI. This resulted in lots of issues which have resulted in her personality drastically changing . 

She has gone from a mild mannered , friendly person to a angry , combative , confused and panicky person . 

Her health care has been disjointed and a mix of private and NhS (we are in uk). 

She has panics 5 times a day and we are constantly fire fighting . Ambulances get called , she’s in and out of hospital all the time . 

The doctors can’t seem to reverse her mental state back to what it was . She had this same issue a year ago and an endocrinologist fixed it by fluid reduction to raise her sodium . But this time nothing is working . 

Has anyone else experienced this . And what should I expect ? It’s so hard to care for her because she falls out with all the carers and nurses and thinks we are all plotting against her . 

She becomes quite manic at times and is angry so much. She always says she isn’t being fed or given medicine or showers but I know she is or in fact she refuses it a lot of the time so it’s so hard . 

I just wanted to know it’s not just me in this hell I feel I’m in a night mare with a tyrant . I love my mum to death it’s only me and her and has always been like that. But I can’t handle this it’s breaking me apart.

My mom (65F) was given 6 months left from her oncologist  from stage 4 pancreatic mets liver and stopped doing chemo / was passed off to palliative/ hospice care in the last 2 weeks.


 She began treatment of Morphine (pill) in addition to oxycodone she was already taking during chemo to help with stomach pains from the tumor. She started to feel more considerable pain to which her hospice nurse said she should effectively double her current morphine intake to try to curb the pain. 


Following this increased dosage of morphine,  all semblance of her lucidity is essentially gone. Shes barely eating anymore, cant keep focused, dozes off regularly, stares off into the distance, tried to go drive her car without her keys, etc. 

The case manager of her hospice care then decided to bring her morphine dosage back down to the level it was prior after seeing she was delirious, but that was now 4 days ago and she hasn't shown sign of cognitive improvements and is still in generally very rough shape. 

I was under the assumption her lucidity would would return when we scaled back her morphine, but 4 days later it hasnt and im heartbroken and concerned that it may be the development of her cancer causing the cognitive impairment and not the changes to her morphine dose. 

Does anyone have experience with this or know poignant questions i can ask her hospice case manager to try to help her regain some of her lucidity? Would changing from pill to liquid morphine be potentially beneficial? Is there scans we should run to see if its indeed a progression of her tumor? She was given 6 months just 2 weeks ago and i just cant help but feel the decline has been much more rapid than anticipated, and every day i hope she wakes up and goes back to her normal lucid self she was a few days ago.

How long will he live without treatment and will he likely die in his sleep?

NO MATTER WHAT.🔥,"I waited for the results to arrive so I could share the news here. Sorry for the bad grammar etc, first of all I'm not native english speaker, plus I'm so fuckin happy right now, my hands are shaking as I type this lol.

My mom's story would be a good material for a book. She got diagnosed with stage 3 HER+++ Breast Cancer in late 2018. At first, she started out chemotherapy in Jan 2019 and got first five doses. Everything was looking good, her doctors were shocked by how well she is responding.

Then she heard about alt-med. First it was graviola leaves, vilcacora, essential oils etc. At first she was only using them to ""Supplement"" chemotherapy, but over time, she started believing more and more that it's those products who helped her, and ultimately quit chemotherapy altogether.

Unfortunately, as you can guess, in Jan 2020 she was diagnosed with metastases. The cancer has spread to the brain. The doctors did remove the whole tumor from her brain, but told her that without chemo she has months, if not weeks to live. And.. she did not listen to them, and I wasn't strong enough to convince her to start treatment. I tried to, pleaded with her, but she was too stubborn and always said that chemotherapy kills people.

She bought even more essential oils and ""natural supplements"". Miracolously, her body was strong enough to hold on until August. That's when she got diagnosed with brain metastases - again - after suffering multiple epilepsy attacks

They removed the whole tumor again, as it was really small. Luckily, there were no new metastatic sites. And SOMETHING FINALLY CHANGED IN HER. She agreed to visit an oncologist and start a normal treatment again.

3 months ago or so she was started on DXL + Herceptin treatment. The treatment was meant to only be palliative at this point, but already after the first dose it worked wonders, as her tumor shrunk considerably. Earlier this week she went to a checkup after four doses of this treatment. Those past few weeks she started to complain about  her head hurting a lot. She always had migraines, so I was hoping it's just that but honestly I was anticipating the worst. I thought the doctors would tell us that the treatment did not work and her mets are back.

Well, guess what? The hospital just called with the results  


Not only aren't there any new metastatic sites, not only is the brain completely clear of all mets, but her main tumor, which was about as big as a clenched fist is now only a bit bigger than the size of a peanut! The doctors are again at shock at how well she is responding to treatment. She will meet up with her oncologists early next week to discuss this development, but apparently the doctors believe there's quite a good chance for a full recovery now! They are all in awe, as are we all.

To this moment I can't believe this. Half a year ago I was starting to think about her funeral, and now things are going so incredibly well! I'm so glad my mom  was given a second chance to defeat cancer, after her metastatic diagnosis things were looking incredibly bad!

I just hope this story gives hope to you guys, especially if you have been diagnosed with mets yourselves! There's ALWAYS a chance, even if the docs tell you you have only a few months remaining (like they did to my mom). Keep fighting guys, I believe you can ALL win the fight! ✊✊✊",SirLadthe1st,t3_mmocs1,17,2021-04-08 09:53:14,76,mmocs1

She missed a treatment due to low platelets and has been having bad arthritis pain in her hip.

She's 84 lbs and very weak, but when her hip and gut/bowels aren't hurting her she's often in good spirits. We went to chemo yesterday and of course, her NP and oncologist were not in to discuss our fears. So we talked to another NP who encouraged her to hold off on chemo this week and talk to the oncologist next week and reschedule chemo if she decides to proceed.

We started a list of questions, and the big one that keeps coming up is ""What will it feel like if I just let the cancer take over? What can I expect"" I told her I doubted we could get a good answer about what to expect because it's different for every body. But, I figured if I could get answers anywhere, it would be reddit.

I've been mostly lurking here off and on over the last year and have had many questions over that time but try to avoid asking every single question.  Except for recently.  I'm going to put this one out there and get the collective wisdom of you all.  

**TL;DR**

After my recent CT scan, my doctors have said they'll be doing palliative care because my cancer is incurable.  With an expected life expectancy of 3 mos. to 2 years.  Commonly around a year. My medical oncologist is looking at trials.  Trying to decide about a second opinion at an out-of-state facility where telehealth is not available.

&amp;#x200B;

**Medical Background:**

Diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma in April of 2020. I had a tumor on my right throat/base of tongue/tonsil/lymph node and a smaller growth on my left side.  Had 30 radiation sessions.  One and a half chemo-cisplatin doses.  It was intended that I'd have 3 chemo doses but my kidneys didn't take the first dose well.  The doctors delayed my 2nd dose to let me recover and also reduced the strength.  By that time it was too late for the third dose since the radiation was complete.  The chemo/radiation was deemed successful.  

First CT scan(October 2020) they saw a ""shadow"" of something on my lungs but not enough to take action.  

Second CT scan(January 2021) the shadow was a confirmed mass so I had a VATS wedge resection to remove it.  The pathology confirmed it was the same cancer as before.  

Third CT scan(May 2021) metastasis to my vertebrae(currently undergoing radiation) and several metastasis to my liver(waiting for medical oncologist  for a treatment plan) and this is where a second opinion  \_might\_ be able to offer something.  

**Questions:**

Q1. I'm already getting what I believe is good care at the University of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance(UW/SCCA).   How do I(58M) evaluate the value of getting a second opinion at MD Anderson(MDA) in Texas? 

Q2. Can I assume my doctors and the tumor board at UW/SCCA have access to the same information as MDA? 

&amp;#x200B;

The conflicts for me are several.

1. Since I'm in the palliative phase, I think the logistics of frequent flights to Texas and trying to get support for my symptoms while remote will be less effective and more energy consuming when maybe that effort should be conserved and used for prolonging life and enjoying the time I have left.   Plus the toll on my family. 
2. Wouldn't the prognosis be the same(incurable) in both places? As per my current prognosis we're looking at extending my life expectancy.   Wouldn't both places have access to much of the same information and expertise?  As far as I can tell metastasis to the liver is a bad thing. 
3. The primary value I can see is that MD Anderson might have access to a different set of clinical trials. But I don't know how valuable that is in the overall scheme of things.

She was diagnosed with melanoma metastatic to the lungs and liver a month ago and started immunotherapy last week and new heart medications last month. The biggest obstacle I’ve encountered as a caregiver thus far is that I call and email her oncologist and her cardiologist about worrisome new symptoms (loss of vision, shortness of breath, very low blood pressure, high pulse) and they often don’t get back to me for 1-2 days.  Once I waited a full day just for a nurse to call and tell me to take her to the hospital.  I have spoken to both doctors about the problems with communication and asked about the best way to reach them, and they always tell me to call and leave a message or send emails.  They assure me they will get back to me sooner next time; however it just doesn’t happen. 

So far the delays haven’t caused much harm that I can discern except that she’s been uncomfortable and anxious for longer than necessary.  However, I worry about a serious situation arising. With all of her existing medical conditions and symptoms, it is difficult for me to discern when I should take her to the hospital without medical advice. I have tried to ask questions like, “when should I take her to the hospital?  What symptoms should I watch for?”  They just tell me to take her to the hospital if I think it’s an emergency and to call otherwise. I doubt my ability to assess that when her baseline health is so poor. 

Additionally it seems like I need to remind every doctor of details of her medications, medical history, etc every time that we speak. Sometimes after I mention something, they change their recommendation. I worry that at some point I will not realize that a piece of information is important to a conversation and a mistake will be made.  Another problem has been palliative care nurses giving advice like, “give her cranberry juice” when cranberry juice is specifically contraindicated with one of her medications.  I’m very anxious about all of this. 

Does anyone have any advice?  Is this typical?  How do you cope with it?  Are my fears unfounded?  I’m feeling like I’m failing in this role and don’t know how to do better.",FatesOnTheNod,t3_nr9rrm,5,2021-06-03 10:00:58,4,nr9rrm

They discovered that is a rarer form of soft tissue cancer with the tumour encasing one of his kidneys. They gave him a good prognosis and started chemo. He also had a water-treatment where he would 'bathe' in slightly warm water while getting chemo to see if they could sort of 'boil' the tumour. After 8 treatments and 2 new scans they said he was responding very well and that they would now move on to the next step of getting him cancer free. Removing the tumour surgically.

We were told that it would take around 5 hours in which they were to slice his whole abdomen open, remove the kidney with tumour and a part of the lower intestine. After 7 1/2 hours on the operating table he was 'done'. We were told that what they saw when opening him was completely different from what they saw on the scans. It had spread. They had removed around 60cm of the lower intestine but didn't remove the kidney beacause some of the cancer tissue had wrapped itself around a very important blood vein. (I'm Norwegian and I'm not sure of the word for it).

Eveything that had up to this point been very positive, now changed. He would never be cancer free but they would give him 20 more good years.

A letter from the hospital came a couple days ago. The prognosis has drastically changed. He is now in palliative care. The spreading hadn't responded at all to the treatment and they haven't determined yet the speed in which the tumour is spreading but it's fast. There is nothing more to be done for him except for trying to slow it down but they've given him 5 years tops. 

My dad isn't young. He is 65 so getting to live to 70 isn't something everyone gets the chance to do. The problem is that he has spent his whole life working two jobs, making sure that we had food on the table, 4 walls and everything we needed to live a good life. I know it happens to a lot of people but it's just so unfair that his retirement is going to be spent as a cancer patient and then that's it..",Captain-Panic,t3_ntgldd,4,2021-06-06 07:53:53,3,ntgldd

Some background:
I’m 33 and I was recently diagnosed with renal cancer after presenting with gross haematuria in April (blood in urine).

An ultrasound showed a large 15cm tumour on my left kidney, which the surgeon rushed to have removed along with the rest of the kidney, surrounding tissue, lymph nodes and adrenal gland. 

Post op it was declared there was no sign of any distant metastasis, though results from histopathology showed the type of renal cancer was a collecting duct carcinoma - very rare, aggressive and with a poor prognosis due to no effect known treatment.
Plan was ro remain under surveillance.

Fast forward a few weeks, today’s follow up with my oncologist was rather shocking/unpleasant - recent CT scans show the cancer has spread at an alarming pace and there is now distant metastasis in both lungs and throughout my liver.

Current prognosis is that I will hopefully see Christmas, and I’ve been prescribed a palliative course of Gemcitabine + Cisplatin to try and make that happen.

My oncologist has seemingly given up (and I understand he may have every reason), but I feel I may still have a few straws to grasp at if I can get the tumour genetically sequenced in time to see if there are any targeted therapy options for my particular mutation. Seems to easier said than done, however.

I’m going to reach out to as many places as I can for a second opinion (why not), but given covid restrictions my options are largely limited to domestic clinics and it appears there are no current trials or any way to fast track marker sequencing here (I’m in the UK).

Does anyone have any advice or experience with this type of cancer? (anything will do, even if it’s not related to the question above, I’m still kinda in shock).",Shutterspark,t3_nvcuyq,2,2021-06-08 19:58:07,3,nvcuyq

I was preparing for my 4th year med school final exams when my father was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. My dad had always been the most positive and cheerful person anyone could ever come across. And when i say this, i literally mean he was the personification of cheer. He would always go out of the way to help ANYONE even if he wasnt at his best. He never hesitated or turned away anyone who needed help. He was my best friend. I shared EVERYTHING with him and we always ended up laughing like maniacs at the smallest things. It was ALWAYS fun to be around him, especially when i used to have bad days. His hugs were like a warm blanket wrapped around you on a cold winter day. He was the smartest person i know and always inspired my to do my best. He studied for an exam and wrote 11 papers and passed with an 80% at the age of 50! If that doesnt show dedication i dont know what else does.

When i was 1 year old, i lost my mother due to an asthma exacerbation. My grandparents had suggested to bring me up but my father would not give in to it and he was the one that brought me up.

The time from his diagnosis until his last day had been the most cruel days that life could have thrown at me. He was started on chemotherapy immediately. My dad was a chubby, healthy man and with the cancer growing inside him, I saw it eat him up until he was nothing but bone and skin. I was looking at my father slowly dying in front of my eyes with nothing that i could do to help him despite being a medical student. I tried to spend as much time i could with him just talking to him throughout the day.

I could never stand watching him go through the effects of chemotherapy. No amount of studying about the drugs and side effects will ever prepare you to watch your loved ones go through it. The continuous nausea, vomiting, pain and the suffering. The cancer had spread to his liver, which made him develop ascites and always had his abdomen filling up with liquid that had to be taken out once in every 2 weeks. All I could ever think of when it happened was how MY DAD was someone who NEVER deserved any of this. He was the best person I know and the most selfless person. He had reached a point where he could not tolerate the chemotherapy anymore and chose to stop it. I supported him.

During his last days, he had to be rushed to the hospital because of an acute kidney injury. He started becoming more disoriented. He was in the ICU for 20 long days. They had him intubated and plugged into all sorts of machines from mechanical ventilation to continuous dialysis. I could not bring myself to see him like that. It was the hardest thing I had ever had to do.

There came a point when none of the medical interventions were helping him, rather it was causing him more suffering. The doctors had given us the only option of palliative care. When my dad was shifted to the palliative care room, he was not conscious. He just slightly opened his eyes every now and then to look at me. I sat by him, holding his hand throughout. He was there in palliative care for 3 days. I literally saw him die in front my eyes. His kidneys completely shut down and his entire body started swelling up with  fluid. The first say when i placed my hand in his, he tried to hold my hand. By the end of the 3rd day, there was nothing.. His heart started slowing down and I held him until his last breath, his last heartbeat. I never thought i would ever have to see my father, the person i loved and respected the MOST in life, my best friend, my whole world, die in front of me like that.

Its been almost 8 months now and there never goes a day where i dont think about him. My dad was so proud of me when I got into med school and the fact that he will never see me graduate jusy tears me up. I am currently in a 7 year relationship and it hurts me so much to think that my kids will never get to see their gem of a granddad. The fact that I will never be able to hug him, talk and laugh with him, discuss important events of my life with him, hear his advices, his voice EVER again just hurts me so much. This loss has left such a big hole in my life, I dont think anything or anyone can ever mend it. I miss my father. ALOT.",Academic-Bee-7171,t3_nx8n6f,27,2021-06-11 05:51:41,56,nx8n6f

Less than two months ago, he was walking and talking like his normal self.  After exhibiting symptoms like brain fog and tiredness, he was admitted to the hospital.  Over the next several days he devolved to the point that he lost consciousness, had seizures, and had to be moved to the ICU so a vent could take over his breathing.

Finally after over a dozen different tests, CT scans showed a tumor in his liver and spots on his lymph nodes.  The biopsies came back revealing high grade neuroendocrine cancer.  His cognitive decline turned out to be paraneoplastic encephalitis as a result of the cancer.  He was not a smoker and the doctors don't know where the cancer originated, but they said it doesn't matter since the treatment is the same.

All the doctors urged immediate chemotherapy, so my family agreed.  However, mere days after his first round of chemo, he caught a hospital-borne infection and went into septic shock.  They were able to stabilize him with vasopressors but he had to go on continuous dialysis.

Eventually he improved enough that the oncologist was scheduled to speak with us about next steps, i.e. the next round of chemo.  Unfortunately, his g tube somehow dislodged and leaked into his abdominal cavity, causing him to go into shock again.

At this point, he is stable, but the oncologist says no further cancer treatment can be provided - whether chemotherapy or immunotherapy - because of my dad's weakened state.  He is only getting dialysis every other day, is no longer on vasopressors except sometimes during dialysis, is on a trach collar, and is tolerating tube feeding but having diarrhea and bed sores.  

The doctors have said that our choices are essentially 1) moving him to comfort care, or 2) transferring him to a long term care facility, where they expect him to eventually catch another infection and pass from something like that rather than the cancer.  No one believes he will make any meaningful recovery.

My family is not entertaining any false hopes; we have talked about comfort care every single day for weeks now, consulted extensively with the doctors, the palliative care team, etc.  I think my purpose in posting this was just to see if by some chance there was something we haven't thought of.  I'd especially be interested in hearing from any doctors, researchers or medical professionals.

Is there anything else we can do?

Every day when I wake up, I feel like I'm in a nightmare.  It is the hardest, most frightening, stressful, grief-filled time in my life.  I am doing my best to accept that I need to let him go, but until the moment we move him to comfort care, I want to be sure there's nothing we're missing.

After numerous blood tests, biopsy, X-rays, a couple of CT-scans, and a Bronchoscopy, doctors have advised that it looks Stage III-IV, even if it hasn't spread to any other organs (at least by last CT-scan in March it was around Pleural space only, another CT-scan is scheduled this Monday).

&amp;#x200B;

Doctors have advised that there's no cure for this cancer - even if it's Stage I; however, if a patient is young enough, and the cancer is still at Stage I/II, they can perform the surgery/Radiation/Chemo/Targeted/Immunotherapy, and increase the life expectancy, but in Stage III/IV he doesn't have any chance for surgery + due to his age and other risk factors (i.e. he's a diabetic + minor heart condition + he's suffering from hypertension) they cannot give him 100% Chemotherapy as well.

So, he's already completed 3 (70%) cycles of Paclitaxel (200 mg) + Carboplatin (300 mg) Chemotherapy, and the next plan is to give him 3 more (70%) cycles of Paclitaxel (200 mg) + Carboplatin (300 mg) + Bevacizumab (a targeted therapy?). As far as we understand, all of these are only Palliative treatments and not Curative treatments (correct me if I'm wrong).

&amp;#x200B;

We have consulted 3 Oncologists and they all have confirmed that the treatment he's receiving is fine. However, I just wanted to check if there's any other treatment available in the market, which might be Curative that we can go for? Dad is fully aware about this disease and the treatment he's receiving, he's still super strong and hopeful that miracle will happen to him if he'll go for all the treatments he could receive.",These_Negotiation535,t3_o2kv0r,3,2021-06-18 09:10:52,1,o2kv0r

He went in because he felt a little lump in his side and they found pretty large tumors in both kidneys, so surgery was never an option. He also had some enlarged lymph nodes in his abdomen and a  couple in his chest. He ended up getting into a trial through the Mayo Clinic where he was getting infusions of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab. Then in December, he ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with H. Pylori and colitis. They didn't really know if it was the antibiotics or the treatments making him sick. They paused the infusions and put him on prednisone. He started feeling much better, even drove around town visiting his buddies at the local businesses. His next CT scan showed some progression (like the mass in his abdominal wall), a small spot of concern on his lung, a small lesion on his liver, a bone lesion, and a couple more lymph nodes..BUT  there were also a lot of masses shrinking and some even disappeared. He was taken off the trial but his oncologist kept him on the Nivolumab. He started feeling worse and the abdominal wall mass ended up getting huge..it was bigger than a grapefruit and sticking out of his side. In April, they decided surgery wasn't an option, radiation would be best. They also took him off the Nivolumab and put him on Keytruda/Inlyta. He completed the radiation and the mass on his side is basically gone. He has been getting weaker and he's lost so much weight and muscle mass. He basically gets out of his recliner to go to the bathroom and maybe the kitchen once or twice a day, with his walker. His skin sometimes has a gray-ish hue to it..and yet he wants to go to a family reunion 4 hours away this weekend. We just got the results of his latest ct scan today:

IMPRESSION: 

1. Worsening hilar and mediastinal (including pericardial) adenopathy.

2. More numerous and enlarging liver masses.

3. Worsening, enlarging mesenteric nodes.

4. Enlarging right renal mass.

5. Stable left renal masses.

6. Bone lesions suspicious for metastases. Sclerotic lesion in body of L4 extends into left pedicle and lytic lesion in body of L3.

7. Asymmetric wall thickening of a bowel loop in the left upper quadrant (possibly colon)

So now, it's in his kidneys, lymph nodes, soft tissue, his lungs, liver, his spine, and possibly his colon..I know it's rare for RCC to mets in the colon..but assymetrical thickening is generally cancer or Crohn's from what I understand. Next I'm sure it will be the brain, if it isn't there already. They haven't done a scan yet.

So a couple questions for anyone that has been through this..At what point do the doctors tell you to start considering focusing on palliative care? Has anyone had it spread this much and miraculously turned it around? Are there any other drugs or drug combinations that would possibly help or should I start preparing myself for the inevitable? My mom is taking care of him by herself, besides some help from me and my brother when we aren't working. When it gets really bad, how long does that last and how soon do you think it will get really bad? My dad doesn't want to know, he won't ask the doctors questions about anything. My mom does somewhat but it's easier for her to just block everything out and focus on taking care of him. I'm the only one doing hours of research trying to understand everything and prepare myself.. someone fucking needs to.",winternycole,t3_o5isw5,15,2021-06-22 09:18:11,17,o5isw5

My husband and I have, as much as possible, accepted this diagnosis and I'm awaiting an appointment with an oncologist to discuss my palliative care plan. Currently, I'm operating at 98% so I'm also tentatively planning different activities to meet old friends, see places I love and enjoy whatever time I've got ahead of me whilst I'm able to.

So yes, incredibly sad news and I don't want to die BUT my husband and I are planning as luxurious, pleasurable and calm future as possible. I'll co-operate with palliative care and, if by some miracle, any future treatment plans that might pop up as my situation changes. 

However some members of my family, despite me sitting down with them and clearly laying out my plans, are already trying to push for harsher treatment options (something my consultant and I agreed would merely leave me feeling ill during my last months/years and unable to enjoy my time) and suggesting ""healthy eating options"" and weird alternative medicines/cannabis. 

How can I, politely, reiterate to my well-meaning but in denial family members that I'm happy to work with my doctors and deal with my diagnosis on my terms and I most certainly won't be wasting the short time I've got left (before my tumour forces me on to tube feeding) drinking kale juice?!

I went through 9 courses of chemo + target therapy, the most intensive and (supposed to be) most effective (FOLFOXIRI + Avastin). I had a stable disease after 5 courses but now a disease progression after 9 courses. And this is a huge shit, because usually people get much better results from this type of treatment.

Now I will take part in clinical trial of Lonsurf, but all doctors say only about palliative treatment...

But damn, I'm only 30, the additional 1 year of life doesn't mean anything.

So, maybe someone has any information about clinics/doctors/treatment methods that still can convert this shit to being resectable?

One more issue is that I'm from Ukraine and the treatment outside my country is very expensive for me.

She will come and live with us if she gets out but now I’m worried she won’t get out as she’s so weak.

I’ve been lurking here for some time and am really grateful for all the advice and thoughts I’ve read. And I’m so sorry for everything you and your loved ones are going through.

The background -- my mother is in extreme frequent pain due to late-stage NSCLC which has reached multiple parts of her body. We are trying to balance that against the extreme nausea she gets from opioids.

My request: for those of you who have experienced this with your loved ones, what did you do to help with the pain (whether drug-related or not)? I read suggestions to distract from the pain, but there is nothing that seems to work. If you are the patient, what do you wish your family would do? Sometimes she tells me to go away and other times I know she wants me to stay. She often says the opposite of what she wants, but not consistently, so sometimes I have a hard time figuring out what to do (or what she wants).

How do you respond when they constantly tell you they’re a burden? I *choose* to be here and I *choose* to help. What do you say when they talk about how unfair life is, or that they’re being punished by God, or that they wish they could just end it all? I want to help with these thoughts and feelings so badly but it would be terrible to say ""it's going to be okay"" -- we all know that's not true.

What else could I try, to help her be more comfortable or feel more loved?

Note: I’m frequently communicating with her oncology, palliative oncologist, and oncology-department social worker (all for their advice). I’m specifically looking for any thoughts this community has to share, from personal experience. Thank you so, so much.",MentalPeach5902,t3_oqkhju,0,2021-07-24 06:20:38,1,oqkhju

She was successfully treated using a clinical trial drug, but we are unable to obtain it in order save her life.","4  years ago on the day of our rehearsal dinner, my wife started her first  round of chemotherapy. She had been diagnosed a couple of months before  with stage IVb endometrial cancer. The following 6 months she endured  monthly chemotherapy, hairloss, and a major and life changing surgery.  It was our introduction into the world of living with and trying to  survive cancer.

Since then she has  experienced several recurrences, received several successful  treatments, and traveled to several of the top hospitals around the  country in search of something cutting edge, like the stuff you see on  the front page of reddit from time to time about breakthrough therapies.  All the time, my wife and I were beginning our lives together. We  learned how to be a good husband and wife, she went to school full time  to become a nurse, we bought our first home, and we got Millie, our  puppy.

All the time distracted by  the journey of our lives that we were starting was the constant reminder  of her persistently returning cancer. We needed to find our  breakthrough therapy - one that could allow her to live her life  finally free of this horrible disease.

We  participated in several clinical trials after countless hours of  research and consults from physicians and patient advocates all over the  country.

We found it. She was  enrolled in a  phase 1 clinical trial of a Wee1 inhibitor drug. This  type of drug targets a rare mutation of hers. This is what we've been  looking for! We moved across the country and took the chance.

We  held our breath when they finally reported results after a month of  therapy. The drug worked, and it worked very well. it reduced her cancer  by 90 percent in just one month. She continued on the trial for several  months.

We finally started to see  the future of our lives together unfold in our minds. We were able to  conceive a life with this horrible disease behind us and not talk about  the future with an undercurrent of apprehension. After all, we wanted to  start a family.

Suddenly she  was removed from the trial. Phase 1 trials are designed to determine  safe dosing, and Becca's was too high. Her platelet count was too low.  Can she take a break? Can we reduce the doseage? No and no. Furthermore,  she is ineligible for admission into ANY wee1 inhibitor clinical trials  in the future. What a shame as the therapy is now in phase 2b  throughout the country with huge success and given in more moderate  dosages.

Fast forward to today. She is downstairs, trying to sleep again. She can't make it through  the night because we have to use a 60 mL syringe to empty the bile from  her stomach several times from a NG tube that comes out of her nose.  Shes listening to a loud podcast. It helps to have white noise over the  sound of the pump that powers her TPN, or liquid nutrition, and soon I  will have to wake her up to drain ascites fluid from her abdominal  drain.

Her cancer has taken up  most of the space in her abdomen and is blocking her intestines. She  cannot eat, drink, or even swallow her own spit. She weighs 85 pounds.

The  palliative care team keeps reminding her that she doesn't need to  continue down this road if she doesn't want to, but she wants to fight.  After all, she is only 35 years old.

Despite  the incredible amount of physical and emotional pain she is in, she  will not give up. How could you when you KNOW there is a drug that will  save her life.

Her Oncologist is on board. She will create a treatment plan and safely administer it.

The  drug companies will not let her have it under compassionate  use/expanded access despite ""right to try"" legislation that was signed  in 2018.

We don't know what else  to do. We have called, sent letters, e-mailed, and pleaded with the drug  companies to release the drug to us with no liability. Please, if  anyone has any ideas for how to approach this, we have been through the  Goldwater Institute, Mytomorrows, Widetrial. Does anyone have experience  with this?

He's had two treatments and has stopped the majority of his other medications (CHF from multiple MI's, high cholesterol, high BP, diabetes 2, etc) and this has eased a lot of his most unbearable symptoms.

The biggest issue is the immunotherapy. From what I can gather, immunotherapy isn't a covered service under hospice. To be clear, this isn't something that will cure him in the slightest. It's meant to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with the cancer. Be that as it may, I'm not the one who writes insurance policies. 

Here's where I'm wondering if we have a work around. He has medicare, but also has private insurance through my mom's work. Has anyone ever tried to get hospice covered by Medicare while also getting a private insurance to cover immunotherapy? Or even some other medication/treatment not covered under hospice care? 

The doctors say that even with the immunotherapy, his life expectancy isn't more than 6 months. He has palliative care now, and while that does help, I worry about him not having the equipment he may need to get through worsening symptoms at home, and ending up in the hospital during the end of his life. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for being so ramble-y about this. I can clarify want information if needed. Thanks for the help! And also fuck cancer.",hailhell,t3_pa559h,1,2021-08-23 17:56:55,2,pa559h

I can understand why he chose to not receive treatment for his cancer, and the family is prepared that he would leave us in less than a year. I have been made arrangements to travel to Singapore (where he and the rest of the family is) to see him in December (I am in California right now). last evening, I was contacted by my sister that she thinks I should plan to move my travel dates up because Dad isn't doing quite well. I started making plans with my company on possibly travelling sooner.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I was diagnosed with breast cancer (Her2/Neu 2+) last month, and just started my first chemo last Thursday. Been feeling like shit so far. But I know it's totally treatable, it's just the process that sucks. I would be on 6 cycles of chemo, followed by full mastectomy, and radiotherapy after.

Since the first day I was introduced to my oncologist, I had a nagging feeling that she does seem to miss out details if I don't ask the right questions. My surgeon told me that my oncologist indicated that I am in Stage 2A, but when I asked her, she said stage 1. I was like, ""Huh? The surgeon who just left the room told me you indicated 2A in the files and asked me to talk to you about it."" She then went on to say that I could be a stage 2A or stage 2B depending on my subsequent scans, she isn't too bothered by the staging. She sounded empathetic about my situation, and when I asked about travelling to Singapore to see my dad who is on palliative care for terminal stage lung cancer, she was totally supportive that I can fly without any concerns, and we can start the chemo after I return. I asked her would it be better if I start my chemo before I travel, her response was, ""yeah it would be good to start but you are at an early stage so it's okay if you want to delay it I just have to discuss with your surgeon on changes of plans."" Anyhow, we decide to have 2 cycles of chemo before I travel. But the impression I got is, I'm not in a critical condition to have chemo start asap, and my staging is unclear. She did get me a little paranoid trying to make sure I know what questions to ask, but my job requires me to be very inquisitive (I'm an interior architect) so I didn't think much about that.

Fast forward a few weeks later, I told her I'm still waiting for the chemo port appointment, and she said, oh yes you said you didn't want the port so you changed your mind? I told her I've NEVER said I don't want the port. So she went ahead to put in a request for the appointment. Meanwhile she asked if I want medication to be mailed to me or to be picked up at one of the 3 Kaiser pharmacies. We discussed and ended the call. 2 days later I was informed by the pharmacy there were drugs that I need to pick up, and I got 3 items in the bag. She also arranged for me to have my first chemo cycle via infusion, and when I asked if I should wait for my port or delay my chemo to after my travel, she went on to say that my cancer is an aggressive one and it is important that I get my chemo started asap. I reminded her she told me I could choose to travel first, and it didn't sound like it was urgent. I also reminded her that she arranged for a PETscan for me the immediate following morning, and does she think the schedule is okay? She assured me mine's an aggressive cancer type and definitely needed immediate chemo attention, and according to her, so far chemo hasn't affected a person so bad that they can't follow through with a biopsy the day after.  And then she asked me how do I want to pick up my drugs, by mail or thru one of the 3 pharmacies? So I asked, is it the 3 items she sent me last week? Yes it is, and I asked her what they were and what am i supposed to do with them. In the same phone call, we also fixed my travel dates and the 3rd chemo to happen on the day after I return. She told me there is a bloodwork I need to do on Wednesday, keep a lookout for that appointment. She kept emphasizing that the chemo appointments were full, but the chemo clinic is doing this arrangements just for her. By now I am getting a little pissed with her inconsistent answers but I left it there.

Fast forward Thursday, during chemo the nurses told me I actually would need a bloodtest before EVERY chemo session. That's when I started losing my mind. I told her my 3rd cycle is booked on the next day upon my return from Singapore, so unless I do my bloodtest on the plane, I need to move that 3rd appointment a day late. I emailed my oncologist about that and she approved it, so another case settled, I am not pleased but whatever.

Friday morning, I was sitting in the hospital gown waiting for my biopsy, when a call from my surgeon's clinic came, and told me my biopsy is cancelled because I am going for a full mastectomy anyway. I was freaking mad that they had over a week to look at this scans and how can such screw-ups still happen? Their excuse was, an email was sent 10pm the previous night to inform me of the cancellation. Around about the same time, since my co-worker who survived BC stage 4 checked in with me, and reminded me to stay away from my kittens for 48hrs. That was my trigger point. NO ONE TOLD ME THAT I need to stay away from skin-contact, use my own facilities, and stay away from kittens, children and elderly.  don't mind to manage some slips here and there for my own problems, but if it endangers my loved ones around me, that's where I draw the line.

I called member services, hoping mad. My oncologist called me back, and insisted she gave me clear details about my staging (which by now its a Stage 2B due to MRI results), told me clearly about the drugs before she sent it to me, and I had focused on that one thing that did go well, out of a hundred things that did go well and its not fair to her. She insisted she made no mistakes, the nurses should have told me about avoiding pets and stuffs, but she also added that its common sense anyways so that shouldn't be a big issue to not get briefed on it, and she assured me no damage has been done.

She refused to apologize, I was too weak to fight her, I closed the case. Saturday someone told me I need to avoid vitamins (I made a post here asking about it and everyone said i should check with my oncologist). I left her a message right after, and she just replied that I can take any vitamins I want, as long as I don't do that on the day of chemo. Meanwhile, a nurse called in to check on me, and i asked about the vitamins. She mentioned antioxidants types, such as vitamin A and C, should be avoided, but vitamins D and B12 seems fine but she wants me to check with my oncologist.

So here I am. What should I do? Send this rant to member services and have her replaced?",Tiny_Pochemuchka,t3_qbl18w,45,2021-10-19 21:09:09,45,qbl18w

I've been reading through all the topics here, but I am really struggling to process all of this.

It came as a massive shock to us. I live in another country, but I speak to my dad daily. We send pictures, voice messages, call. Every day he tells me about his dog walks or whatever else funny thing he did/saw. He is fit, eats healthy, doesn't drink or smoke, exercises daily.

On Tuesday I get a message at 1am from his girlfriend. She thinks he's had a stroke. I tell her to take him to the ER. He goes in, gets some scans done and I phone the ER and speak to the doctor. She's an oncologist and she tells me that from the initial scans she suspects that the two masses on his brain are from lung cancer that has spread to his brain. The masses are swollen, are pressing on his brain and are bleeding. They also see a mass on his lungs.

They book him in for further care and tests. They scan again and the results came back yesterday. It's stage 4 lung cancer as suspected. His lungs are ""okay"" and not really causing that much of an issue, but the masses in his brain are large and causing a range of motor issues. He has severe headaches and he is nauseous.

Another doctor was taking care of him when I phoned in. He also said essentially the same as the first. He then tells me that my dad has less than six months left and that while treatment could potentially add a few weeks to that, it probably will not be worth it if you consider the quality of life aspect of chemo/radiation.

He then broke the news to my dad. I wanted someone to tell him in person. Shortly after my dad phones me and he's heartbroken. It was such a difficult call for me. What really stuck with me, and still makes me sad when I think about it, is how he said ""I want to live. I am still young."". It tore me up seeing my strong, reliable, hero like this.

I know that the end of his story is near. I have accepted that. I told him that my partner and I will be moving back to our home country. We're flying back over the weekend. We'll get a big house and he can live with us and we'll take care of him with love for the rest of his days. He seems to be very excited about this and he has mentioned all the stories he wants to tell me. I am looking forward to hearing them all and talking about all the things we can think of. I want to record our conversations and take pictures. I want to have as many memories of him as I can.

Today he spoke to a friend of his over the phone. She has convinced him that he needs to look into oxygen treatment to cure his cancer. From what I can tell it's called Hyperbaric Oxygen and there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it will do anything much to help. She said that the medical world doesn't want people to know about this because then they would lose money from the cancer industry. Typical conspiracy theorist stuff.

 The doctors have already spoken to him about palliative care which they think is the road forward. My dad is intelligent, but I think he's in denial and he's desperate. In his last time here I would like to give him everything that he wants, but I'm conflicted. This looks to me like pseudo doctors preying on desperate cancer patients. I would love to be wrong about this, but I have to be realistic for both our sakes. I don't want his last few months here to be a desperate shadow of himself clinging to something that is doing nothing while being exploited by people peddling snake oil. But it's not about what I want. It's about what he wants.

I've asked his care team to speak to him again about treatment and palliative care again and I've urged him to ask them these questions. He said that he's relying on me to make these difficult decisions for him. I told him that we can make an informed decision together. I don't know what to do or how to deal with this. I don't want to just tell him ""NO"" and then he resents me and thinks I let him die when I could have saved him.

It was really hard some of the time, dealing with constant diaper changes, vomiting blood, delirium, and a ton of medications to keep track of.

54M in the UK.

Just over two months ago I was planning to go see my elderly parents for my birthday and decided it was probably worth doing a home lateral flow Covid test to try and keep them safe. I wanted to make sure I did it properly so shone a torch (US: flashlight) down my throat in a mirror while scraping my tonsils with the swab. Covid test was negative but what I saw at the back of my throat scared the crap out of me. Honestly if a cartoonist was to draw cancer it looked like that.

Since then I've been to my own GP surgery, ENT consult, MRI, CT Scan, day surgery for a biopsy and finally a PET/CT. Fair play to the NHS. I know they're really struggling with workload at the moment but they've done all this in a couple of months on their fast track cancer program and for that I'm really grateful.

Today I was back in the ENT for the results and it doesn't look too good. I've got a 6cm HPV caused tumor on my right tonsil. Its in my lymph nodes on both sides. Too far advanced to be operable. CT scan found 'something' in my lung. Not sure what yet as the PET/CT was only done on Saturday and the results are not in yet but given the tumor in my throat I'm not too optimistic.

If it is cancer in my lung they told me it would be palliative care only. For my throat they're planning 6 weeks or daily radio therapy with weekly chemo at the same time. I've got to have a feed tube put in my stomach as they expect I won't be able to eat by about half way through. Speech and nutritional therapy planned too. It gives me a 40% to 50% chance of surviving providing the lung isn't cancer.

Not even sure why I'm making this post. Maybe just to write this all out for my own benefit. I joined this sub a couple of months ago but didn't want to post until it was medically confirmed. The whole thing is bewildering. I don't know how I ended up this far advanced without ever noticing any symptoms. I was fit, cycling hundreds of miles a week, eating healthy and wam, here's cancer. The treatment sounds brutal but I think I've got to try. Apparently I'm supposed to advocate for myself but I have no idea how to do that. I don't even know what questions to ask, either on here or to the doctors.

Oh well. Thanks for reading. Good luck and health to all of you on this sub.

UPDATE: Thanks all of you for your replies and encouragement. Hope you get to see this update. I've just had a bit of good news from the hospital. They don't think the 'something' on my lung is metastic cancer. Must not have lit up on the PET/CT. Now the coming fight seems so much more achievable.

He said the prayers over the candles and went to sleep. He never really woke up again. He died this past Friday night, in the middle of the tornados that rocked Missouri and Arkansas. 

Edit, Update: Hospice came today and the nurse told us that from her standpoint, she is guessing he has about one to two weeks left before passing. My family is a wreck, but my dad has been made very comfortable, which is a blessing. 


My mom and I take care of my dad who has late stage pancreatic cancer. 

In late September 2020 my dad, 66, started itching. All over his body. It got worse and worse and worse and could not be calmed by anything. He went to the doctor, who suspected something was wrong with his liver. 

After many tests and scans, the results came back devastating: pancreatic cancer. The tumor was 2.5 cm long and putting pressure on a bile duct connected to his liver. He was somewhere between stage 2 and 3 given the size. 

When I got this news, I didn't sleep more than 4 hours in an 8 day period. It shook me to my core. It upset me worse than anything I've ever experienced. My dad was and is one of my closest people, one of the kindest and generous people I've ever had the privilege of knowing. The rock of the family. The person who rescued anyone in the family who asked. The crazy clever romantic who wooed my mom with dried sausage and a coffee table when they started dating. 

The great news was that they caught it substantially earlier than most patients, because it was impacting his liver. (Many pancreatic cancer victims don't show symptoms until late stage 4.) And my dad was otherwise very healthy. 

The bad news is that because of where the tumor is, surgery isn't an option. It was entangled in too many blood vessels. 

The doctors ultimately gave him an extreme dose of chemo, 4 months, paired with an experimental immunotherapy, followed by 6 weeks of high-dosage radiation. My dad was always a fat dude and I don't know his original starting weight. But he had intentionally lost weight prior to the cancer and was a little thicc but healthy. He dropped to 143 pounds in 6 months. My 6 foot 4, broad shouldered, dad-bod dad was reduced to skin and bones. He couldn't walk. He couldnt lift his arms for long.

A few weeks after radiation ended he got more tests and scans. And they were amazing. The tumor didn't shrink enough to surgically remove, but it did shrink a little. And even better, didn't spread, didn't grow, and was showing signs it may have been killed by the treatment. We laughed and cried and had hope for the first time in a year. The doctors said he could try chemo again once he regained weight to see if the tumor, which, dead or alive, was still causing him pain by pressing on nerves, would shrink enough to be removed. 

But he couldn't keep food down. He lost more weight. And was in more pain. Ultimately he had a feeding tube put in. 

Turns out, the stent they put in his bile duct to stop the tumor from compressing it became infected and full of puss. They replaced it and cleaned the area. They also put a mesh stent in his stomach to help food digest easier. 

He was on a very limited diet but between the nausea gone and the feeding tube, he regained almost 20 pounds. 

He had physical therapy. He was starting to walk again with a walker. His personality was back. His appetite was coming back. His independence was slowly coming back. 

A little over week ago my mom called me estastic. Dad had gotten out of bed by himself and used his walker to go to the living room (just outside their bedroom). This was the first time he went somewhere without her in almost 8 months. He was so excited for Thanksgiving. 

Just a few days later he got really, really sick. Delirious. Constantly vomiting. Lost all the weight he regained, even with the feeding tube. Tried to get up in the night while sick and fell, hard. Did not break anything (a miracle) but left him in agony. 

I help take care of him on the weekends and work during the week. My mom called me the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. She said she was sorry, she didn't tell me dad was sick again because it just started up and they were hoping it would pass. She was taking him to the hospital, she said. 

Well she had watered down that for me until she could see me in person later that day. The physical therapist saw his state compared to how he was just a few days prior and told my mom to call an ambulance. He spent the morning and afternoon at the hospital but was discharged the same day. 

After scans and blood tests and physical exams, they said he didn't break any bones in the fall. They said they checked his heart and lungs and they were normal. They said his blood results came back wonderful - that he has fewer cancer indicators in his blood than ever before. He didn't have a fever. They didn't think he was dehydrated (but my mom convinced them to give him IV fluids anyways). 

There's no known medical reason why my dad is failing. Worse every single hour. My dad is no wuss. He survived two heart surgeries for atrial fibrillation and one emergency open-chest heart bypass surgery where they broke all his ribs. He survived semi-serious skin cancer. He had survived a broken jaw and severed finger (successfully reattached) as a small kid. But the pain is unbearable at this point, and he's on 40 mg of oxy twice a day (slow release) plus 5 and 10 mg oxy as needed. Plus a crazy amount of weed, for which he has a medical marijuana card. He's so pumped full of drugs my mom has narcan on hand. 

This morning he told my mom to call hospice. He doesn't want to die yet but doesn't believe any other path exists anymore. For clarity, he has made peace with dying, he did before his diagnosis. But he doesnt want to go now. Namely, he wanted to survive a few more years (originally seemed possible) so he could make some memories with his first and likely only granddaughter who was born in June 2020. ""I want her to have at least one memory with me."" 

A hospice nurse was over within the hour. Already making plans for palliative care and the even more extreme painkillers not offered to him outside of hospice. 

We don't have any idea of how much time he has. 

When he was first diagnosed, he said I went through ""pre-mourning."" Crying all the time, denial, acceptance, frustration, planning ahead. Thinking of the worst things all the time. 

I'm doing it again and I can't stand it. I can't sleep. I'm so tired and dehydrated and typing this out because I need the catharsis of telling someone. I need answers I won't get and I hate that to no extent. Any time something happens - good, bad, terrible - I have a need to look up as much information about the situation as possible. Know all the good bad and neutral components. Have a name to call something. I won't get that here. To have hope thrust upon us and ripped out from underneath us in less than 10 days is just unfair. And there's nothing we can do about it. And I don't know how to comfort my mom and my sister has been in deep denial about everything since day one. 

We're hoping to make it through Haunnukah (my dad is Jewish) and Christmas (my mom is vaguely Christian) one last time. But we just don't know.",maddycakes_stl,t3_r4pvsv,16,2021-11-29 06:55:26,33,r4pvsv

She has been on a ventilator this entire time, so mostly heavily sedated. When she is awake she can open eyes and shake head yes or no to questions. On third day, they inserted a feeding tube. 

On Wednesday the hospital called for the whole family to come in for a meeting and to see her. Because of COVID, only one visitor is allowed per day except in the case of a patient where death is likely. So we knew this was not good. The doctors informed us of her condition and advised that we had the options to move forward with aggressive treatment, or move her to comfort care. 

They all went with the ""she's a fighter/miracles happen/do everything you can"" route. I did not agree, but couldn't bring myself to say that to the 10 of them. Doctors reiterated multiple times that she is very weak and this treatment is rough. Also stated that even if there was a miracle, we should consider her quality of life. They said things like ""oh there's plenty of things out there that help with mobility"" and ""she's a strong woman."" I was intensely internally smacking my forehead. In the last year she's gotten progressively weaker, more tired, constantly in pain, fractured her spine from aggressive tumor growth, constantly sick from radiation, sick from her cocktail of daily pills, developed diabetes, has been suffering from lymphedema....and so much more... and still she was just nonstop on the move all day every day because she told me she was afraid of resting - afraid of going to sleep because she might not wake up. A nurse at one point started upping her pain med IV and sedation, and she started shaking her head no as hard as she could. Through yes or no questions, she indicated to the nurse that she was afraid to go to sleep. That killed me. But it was also on the second day, when she was better. They said the blood thinners were relieving the clots, antibiotics were improving her infection and they turned down ventilator support. I actually thought she might get out of hospital with just amputations... On the fourth day, she communicated to us that she was ready to go to sleep. 

Yesterday morning the hospital called to say she had developed internal bleeding, and they are not really able to now treat this without making other things worse. And all in all, it's just another serious complication piled on.. But my family said ""you can try though right?"" And the doctors had to say yes, but again advised we could revisit comfort care. ""Mmm. Maybe if something else comes up, but keep doing what you can."" They keep insisting she is getting better despite all evidence of the contrary. I worked up the courage to let them know that I didn't agree. My mom would not want this. She is uncomfortable, in pain, helpless and knowing her well enough, feels completely undignified and is experiencing mental distress knowing that we are there crying over her. They simply said ""She's not in pain. They're giving her meds for that. Let's pray""

Religion brought her a lot of comfort when she got sick, and I know that she is at a point of accepting death and going home. She would be thrilled to feel comfortable, have no pain, and see her family smiling at her before she finally goes to sleep. I'm sick and pissed off that they are so in denial, and I will lose my fucking mind if she dies in that ICU alone and in distress",dyslexiyeah,t3_s3oqmv,12,2022-01-14 09:56:19,26,s3oqmv

My mom was diagnosed with stage IV perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in September. 

She finally had a PET scan and it was established that it was non-operative. She had it in nearby lymph nodes, a spot on her lung, and it was wrapped around her hepatic artery.

She was offered palliative surgery and had a stent placed to relieve discomfort in her bile duct. 

They did not expect her to survive more than a few months, that’s how bad it was.

Fast forward to now… she has done 9 treatments of gem/cis/xeloda (I think this is the regimen she’s on?) She has tolerated it very well. 

Her markers are waaaaaaaay down. Like- almost to or at normal levels.

She had a PET and CT done after her 8th treatment… and the results were no evidence of disease.

However, her oncologist says she’s still not eligible for surgery? My understanding is surgery is the only cure. How could she not be eligible if there’s no evidence of any tumors?

They’ve said she’ll move to a maintenance regimen… same drugs, smaller doses. Same frequency of treatment (every other week).

The issue with the frequency is that… she initially was seeing doctors in her city and the care was subpar. We encouraged her to get a second opinion with a physician near where I live, which is 3 hours from her home. She received much better care here and since she was in pretty rough shape at the start, it was decided she would stay with me and my spouse for the time being… but she was adamant she wanted to go home eventually. 

She’s now feeling substantially better and really would like to go home, but the every other week maintenance plan has taken the wind out of her sails a bit, as it basically means that at best, she will spend one week home and one week here… for the rest of her life.

Which brings me to my next question…. Is this it? Do we just watch her do chemo every other week until it stops working? How can someone respond so well to chemo but still have no chance of beating this? 

I’ve just got so many feelings about all of this. I lost my oldest brother to mesothelioma in August and the last year has just…. Mentally/emotionally drained me.

The midaz put her in a zombified state and she was already so skinny. I was trying to get her to eat but she aspirated. I had no fucking clue that was even a thing. We got her transferred to active care after i freaked out on every available dr. She started doing better now that she was getting fluids etc. She was holding a cup of water herself and drinking from it. If we just would have gotten her admitted to there first she could have gotten targeted radiation to her stomach (main source of her pain) which would have really helped her pain. 

My sisters stupid fucking decision and my inability to care for her killed her. Part of me thinks my sister was just tired of dealing with her. She should have known better. She should have known not to leave her in palliative care and let them fuck her up with midaz. Part of me thinks my sister was just tired of caring for her which is also my fault because maybe she wouldn't have been so tired if i stepped up more.",fobygrassman,t3_sqygys,3,2022-02-12 18:56:58,6,sqygys

Finished a year of treatment and continued on maintenance chemotherapy for another year and was cancer free for a while until I relapsed at 22.

I had major surgery to try and contain the cancer which failed. Since then I have been receiving palliative treatment, switching to different chemotherapies for as long as they work.

Unfortunately, I've exhausted all options, and with my health declining I've been told I have a few more weeks. I'm 25 now. I truly don't want to die, but this has been a long time coming, I'm tired, and much more accepting of death then I was when first diagnosed.

It's hard to put into words how I feel about the last 8 years with this disease. I wish I never had cancer, I wish I could continue the life with the ones I love, and live the life a normal person my age should have.

At the same time cancer has made me a better person. It's taught me so many important life lessons as a young adult and has shaped me into the person I am today. I'm grateful for my life and I hope others are able to find some solice in that throughout their time with cancer.",pete_sauce,t3_sz1pwe,76,2022-02-22 23:24:33,532,sz1pwe

I guess I’m looking for advice or different perspectives. My dad is 61 and has been battling cancer for about 6 years now. He stopped eating or drinking much last week because of the pain and ended up in the hospital from dehydration. He was hoping to come home yesterday day, but then he fell and broke his leg. I’m his power of attorney, although he’s still making his own decisions while in the hospital. His doctor called me yesterday to ask about his palliative care plan, and if he had a bed reserved in a hospice or palliative care home. I believe he does have a bed available to him at a palliative care home in town, if he needs/wants it. 

His brothers and sisters (big family) are very insistent that we bring him home, and not to a palliative care home. My sibling (were both in our early twenties) also wants him home instead of hospice care. Before he was hospitalized, I know he would have said the same. If he does go home, I’m able to get him a hospital bed through insurance, and we have a few PSWs in the family. Currently he has a nurse come into his home for an hour a few days a week, and apparently we have a nurse willing to come out of retirement to help too. I’m trying to see if I get can more funding through insurance so we could get a nurse there everyday. We have a big family, so he would never be alone in the house. I’m also looking into taking family leave so I can spend more time with him, and if needed i could move into his house too. 

Still, I’m worried and I don’t know what the right choice is. He is in a lot of pain, there’s cancer in his bones and all of his organs at this point. The hospital has him on pain meds through iv, another iv to keep him hydrated, and oxygen. He’s taking a dose of pain meds nearly every 15 minutes in addition to his baseline dose. I don’t think he’ll ever walk again, he also has a catheter. My biggest concern right now is pain management. I’m worried that if he stays home we won’t be able to properly continue the care plan he’s had in the hospital. Since PSWs can’t administer these sort of drugs, I think we would need a full time palliative nurse in the house. I’m going to talk to our family doctor tomorrow about that, I’m not sure how realistic that would be. He sleeps a lot, and still talks to us a bit. I don’t think he’s said more than five words at once. I just know with a palliative care home he would have 24-hour care and pain meds always accessible. We would also be allowed to visit him anytime. I just want to make sure he is comfortable and in as little pain as possible. 

So, I was wondering if anyone has experience with a loved one in a hospice/palliative care home or end of life care at home to share. Any regrets or advice? And if you’re a patient yourself, what would you choose?",Glad-Kaleidoscope878,t3_t53g1n,8,2022-03-02 16:08:08,5,t53g1n

Terminal.,"I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer about 1.5 years ago.  Stage four because it had migrated from my esophagus to my left lung. I was given treatment that was palliative in nature.  Ten high intensity radiation treatments and then chemotherapy.  The chemo made me so sick that I was admitted to the hospital for four nights and in emergency multiple times. I was so sick that I signed up for assisted dying. They cut back the dose to 50% and it became barely tolerable.  I was then found to be a good candidate for Herceptin treatments.  It worked so well that the cancer disappeared from my stomach and esophagus.  The cancer on my lung was shrinking.    
But, the cancer mutated and started growing again.  So here I am, about to go back on chemo again, and I am dreading it.  I am trying to stay positive but it is becoming difficult.  I put on a brave face for my family and friends, but I am beginning to realize the reality and deal with my eventual death.  This is such a personal experience that it is difficult to explain to anyone what I am feeling.",Gaphumbala,t3_t6ytoe,26,2022-03-05 02:00:09,95,t6ytoe

It progressed to stage 4 in 2020.

He had about three local recurrences in the span of his diagnosis up until 2021, plus some mets in both of his lungs that remained stable since 2020 up until now. 
He was treated with surgery, chemo and radiation every year, having a stable period (no treatment) of about 6 months each year before the next recurrence appeared. 
 
In September 2021 chemo stopped working and he was set to start an immunotherapy trial (dendritic cell vaccines) in February 2022. The reason for having to wait until February was that they needed a ""fresh"" tumor sample to produce the vaccines. 
At this point his last pet scan showed the lung mets grew a bit and a small tumor in his peritoneal cavity, which remained stable, so they decide that they needed to allow the tumor in his peritoneal cavity to grow a bit in order to be able to produce the vaccines for the trial. 

In December 2021 he started having sporadic gastrointestinal issues like cramps, throwing up food, etc.. Doctors attributed this as being a symptom of his multiple surgeries since these issues would solve by themselves in the next one or two days. 

At the beginning of January 2022 he had surgery to remove the tumor in his peritoneal cavity and start producing the vaccines for the trial. 

In January 15th he couldn't pass down food through his stomach and starts throwing up bile with fecal odor, gets admitted to the hospital the next day. 
They do a colonoscopy (all clear), CT scan shows inflammation in the small bowel and they decide to feeding him through TPN and put a nasogastric tube. 
Seven days go by and he still can't eat, so they decide to do surgery. 

During surgery they remove three big tumors that were blocking his small intestines, however they tell us that there are lots of very small tumors all over his intestines, which they were not able to remove. At this point he, his family and I are devastated, but still have some hope on the vaccines trial. 

First four days of recovery go well, but on the fifth day when the nurses first try to move him to the shower he complains that he can't breathe, his oxygen levels start to drop and he gets put in oxygen support. 

Two days go by and he starts developing pneumonia. They can't keep his oxygen levels above 91 so they decide to intubate and put him on a ventilator in the ICU. 

During the next two weeks, while intubated, multiple things start to get better: his pneumonia starts to recede, they remove the tpn, feed him through the nasogastric tube and his intestines start to work again. 

After the second week the doctors decide he still needs to be on a ventilator so they do a tracheostomy. 
During this week things start to get worse: he develops a fistula in his intestines and his intestines stop working, so they put him back on tpn. By this point we are told that they can't do anything for his intestines and he would need to be put permanently on tpn and a permanent drainage for the fistula. 

He then starts having internal bleeding which requires emergency surgery. He survives the surgery and spends the next two days at the icu. On the third day they move him out of the icu and connect an oxygen concentrator to his tracheostomy. 

At this point he has muscle atrophy from being bed ridden for a month and a half. He starts getting severe anxiety attacks and some days they have to sedate him heavily. 

A week goes by and his lungs appear to be getting better, so the doctors start looking forward to remove his tracheostomy. 

Four days ago he starts developing a fever and having lots of phlegm which interrupt his sleep schedule. They do bronchoscopic and blood cultures, find a bacteria and start treating him. The fever gets under control and he starts sleeping well. 

Yesterday his oxygen levels start to decrease and they have to increase his oxygen support. At the same time his respiratory rate increases to 35-60 and the anxiety attacks start coming back. 

This morning we get the news that his xray scans show he has pneumonia again and that they don't know if he will make it this time even if is on antibiotics for the specific bacteria that is causing his pneumonia (first one was an atypical pneumonia since the culture results didn't show anything). 

At this point his family and I are devastated, it's been 2 months in the hospital of non stop suffering for my brother, and by this point, it's taking a toll on everyone's physical and mental health. 

I've been taking care of him in the hospital from 8 pm to 8 am non stop for the last two months, excluding the two weeks he was in the icu. His sister and wife take turns to take care of him during the day. 

As for me, I don't mind the physical stress, I had the luxury of temporarily quitting my job so that I could sleep from 9 am to 5 pm and get back to the hospital by 8pm to take care of him.

He has three children and a wife that need him. I just wanted him to get better, but at this point I know he won't. Even if he makes it out of his current pneumonia infection it's only a matter of time before the tumors in his intestines and lungs start giving him trouble again. I just wish he could die at his home surrounded by his family and not in a hospital bed, it's been two months since he last saw his three children.  

I'm sad because he is suffering so much. I'm sad because of the suffering his family is going through. I'm sad because his children are going to grow up without his dad.
I'm sad because a lot of people who I considered my friends didn't even reach out to provide emotional support in these past two months. 
When he dies I truly am alone, left with no real friends. 

I'm so mad at life right now. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent.

Update 03/13/2022
He was put on palliative care on March 11 and passed away this morning.

I’m tolerating treatment well but it’s palliative only and I’m looking at a max of 1 to 2 years if I’m lucky (which I may be - I’ve already made it 10 months since the diagnosis in May last year).

I have also been stressing out because I have been worrying about what happens when my employer’s short term disability ends. I applied for SSI (you’re permanently disabled if you have a terminal diagnosis), but have been worried it could take months for the process to complete, and would require a lot of follow through that I might not be capable of thanks to the fatigue and brain fog.  

I hadn’t checked the status while I was prepping for and then actually moving, so today I but the bullet and logged in expecting to see nothing. Instead I saw I was approved and SSI will start in June. I keep taking deep breaths, realizing that I CAN take deep breaths since my chest isn’t constricted from worry.

They ended up in hospital after catching Covid. Although they have since recovered from Covid, they are now significantly weaker and have been told that their cancer treatment is stopping as a result. For example, before catching Covid, they could still walk and drive as normal and were fairly independent. Now they can barely take a step without being physically aided by others. 

One of their doctors has estimated they may have weeks to months left at this stage. In looking at them, they still have colour in their face, a great appetite, a want to live and to get outside of their hospital room and the energy to do this (but only in a wheelchair). 

The things that would indicate end stages (eg physical weakness, being withdrawn or angry/upset at times, and spending increasing amounts of time sleeping in the past few days, being resigned to a likelihood of impending death) are things that would be expected of someone who is bored and possibly depressed after being stuck in hospital for three months. 

It’s hard to believe the end stage is close, and how to navigate this with the amount of time off work I should take. 

I’m interested in hearing people’s experiences of how things progressed during the last few weeks/months, and how you navigated this with a full-time job.

For context:
- I am single with no children of my own dependent on me so can be flexible in the decisions I take

- I have a demanding corporate role in the early stages of my career, however fortunately have very understanding colleagues and currently have about 2 months of paid leave available for me to use, and can take unpaid leave if necessary

- I am not the primary caregiver. At the moment my other parent and another family member are the primary caregivers with my sick parent currently residing in a palliative care facility. We are open to the possibility of bringing them home to live with a carer. 

I’m conflicted on whether I should take a leave of absence for an uncertain period of time now (possibly up to 6 months) or continue to work but take extra days off every week or second week, and then take 1-2 months of leave when we get told the end is days/weeks away and after their passing to support my surviving parent who will need a lot of support with their grief and navigating life on their own at that time. 

Any perspectives/insights would be greatly appreciated.",RexGreene,t3_tln9os,9,2022-03-24 00:07:39,12,tln9os

The situation we are currently dealing with, with my father is most likely not a unique one, but certainly a challenging one. Now, it's 2 in the morning and I very much struggle to sort my thoughts when I write LONG stories, so I'll give a shorter version and take in any details later, or if anyone has questions to ask. Stick with me until the end... Here we go.

In 2002 my father was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma which spread to his brain. After a very long round of chemotherapy and gamma knife radiation surgery, he was in the clear from cancer for nearly 12 years. We knew that the gamma knife would cause changes to his personality because of where the tumor was located, but he wanted to live, and so he signed the papers.

Fast forward into my later childhood, we had been recognizing that dad was having seizures more often. He was increasingly becoming paranoid, forgetful, at times delusional, angry, and more irritable. Very gradually...but steadily, and ever increasing.

In 2019 he had begun having ear infections that would continue to recur and never go away. I was weary and would CONSTANTLY ask if the cancer was coming back, but of course he refused to think so. After several mental health emergencies, violent outbursts, seizures, and accidents he was taken to psychiatric units several times where he was eventually given the diagnosis as being schizophrenic. After years of seizures and the damage of 3 surgeries there was irreversible damage done to his brain.

2021 the police are called because of another outburst. He attacked a police officer and had been writing letters to the governor because of his delusions and was finally deemed incompetent to make medical decisions. Because of this, we had him screened and low and behold those recurring ear infections were cancer. He has squamous cell carcinoma which has spread from his ear to his head, brain, neck, and jaw.

Unfortunately, even with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the rule of thumb is that if he knows green means go and red means stop...he's competent and can make his own deicisions. Because of this, a completely curable cancer was not caught soon enough to be taken care of and progressively is getting worse. We were given 6 months with him over a year ago. He's been in palliative care for over a year in a nursing facility where he's increasingly been losing weight, losing the ability to walk, refusing medication believing he's being poisoned, and having no fresh air or the ability to see the sun for over a year at this point.

We have finally gotten him to agree to Ativan and Morphine now that the pain has gotten so bad. The hardest thing about all of this is knowing it was completely preventable if only they had given us the ability to make decisions on his behalf when WE as his family knew that he couldn't. I fight every single day just to get him to agree to basic care in palliative care. He has a hole in the side of his head larger than a golf ball and because he knows green means go... it is what it is.

He's fully alert, but he doesn't know what's going on. Every day he tries to be independent and do things on his own and can't understand why he can't walk. He can't understand why he can't eat. He cries and asks what's happening to him. Every time we tell him it's cancer, his mind won't let him believe it. The government did it because he didn't want to be the president. It's so incredibly hard to watch and I find myself asking when the cancer will just get this all over with. The roller coaster of drpping and rising of vital signs is getting to be too much for us to bear. Some days he's the same man that I always admired, and some days he's like a child with the inability to even rise out of bed. The hospice nurse says that I want to control everything in hospice because I couldn't do anything to save him, and maybe they're right.

It's hard to see someone who's suppose to be in end of life care, still want to live so badly that his days are filled with asking why he can't do anything for himself, asking when he can go home, asking why he's there. And all we can do is feed him Ensure, Ativan, and Morphine and hope it will all end soon.

The only time he will let any of his caregivers help him bathe, clean, or do anything else is when I make it a point to say that I asked them to come in.

Seeing the suffering of a loved one in end of life care is torturous, but it's only compounded when you realize that the thing that signed the papers of that was the simple fact that the individual knew that green meant go.

Thank you for letting me share my story here. I hope this was the appropriate place to put it, but I hope that someone who's going through something similar can reach out to me. Because right now I feel like I'm completely alone. And I can only imagine how my grandmother feels after losing her middle son, her husband, her sister, and now her oldest son in a matter of 2 years to cancer. We're struggling to make sense of all of this.",stingermamabee,t3_ttk77r,1,2022-04-01 06:33:01,16,ttk77r

Have  an urgent question. Dad who is currently 72 years old was fighting stage III duodenal carcinoma for five months. He did well till five rounds of chemo (CAPOX) and suddenly fell sick. He started to vomit with bloody mucus and was unable to eat. We took him to ER and they performed him duodenum Jejunal bypass surgery to help him eat food. After surgery, doc detected that he has high levels of bilirubin in blood (&gt;8). The tumor was pressing against the bile duct causing Jaundice so doc placed a stent to widen the bile duct. 

Yesterday dad partially lost consciousness due to Jaundice so admitted in ICU. His vitals are strong and he is not under any life support. Docs are injecting antibiotics to treat sepsis in his blood to reduce possible infection and jaundice. 

Today doc called us and told dad is still under critical condition. They cannot cure his cancer ( no hope for chemo) as he is too weak. We have to decide what kind of supportive care to provide to reduce his pain (Palliative care). My question are

1. What is life expectancy of my dad who is under palliative care ?
2. Is there any hope that he will recover from sepsis and regain consciousness ?
3. Is there any chance to control the cancer growth or prevent multiple organ failure. 

I want my dad to be At least alive for few months. I can’t believe he is going to leave me alone.",ravimitian,t3_ttqe19,1,2022-04-01 13:14:35,2,ttqe19

Need clarification.,"My mum passed away almost 5 months ago from breast cancer. She had palliative care at home and during the final days, she was being given hydromorphone through an automatic driver and some additional shots of it were administered by me on the recommendation of the palliative nurses as they were only there once a day. I was also told to give her some other drug (can't remember the name) for her restlessness/agitation.

A few days before her death she lost consciousness and right after she died white foam protruded from her mouth. I'm a little bit worried that she was given too much painkiller and as a result lost consciousness and foamed at the mouth after she died. The nurses said the foam was normal but I think they were just trying to ease my mind? Also, me and my sister got into an argument in front of her which was very dumb and mum was clearly upset and angry. Could this have lead to her losing consciousness earlier?

I can't stop thinking about it lately, how I might've lessened her time with us. She was also pretty against the extra morphine but the palliative nurses pushed it and I didn't want her to suffer.

I miss her so much she was my entire world and now I have nothing. Nothing matters anymore. It's getting harder not easier.",missmymum1960,t3_tw17f5,9,2022-04-04 12:49:20,10,tw17f5

He had no symptoms other than dull stomach and back pain and constipation. He received a stoma and has a colostomy bag since. At the time of diagnosis it had already spread to his liver, lungs, and lymph nodes. He completed 6 months of intensive chemo, it was rough but he tolerated it fairly well. There was significant shrinkage of all tumors and no spread during treatment. He began chemo pills and a palliative infusion that was just once every three weeks for maintenance and the cancer grew slowly. The infusion caused stomach bleeding that filled his colostomy bag with blood so then he just took pills. In November of 2021 the cancer continued to progress and he had targeted radiation on the lung lymph nodes and Y90 radioembolisation to his liver around Christmas. This caused his lips and mouth to swell severely, I believe he may have been allergic to some degree. Neither of these things worked, perhaps they caused the cancer to spread faster. In February he was accepted to complete in a research trial for an immunotherapy drug, it took a month to qualify which meant lots of tests and then had two rounds before his scan revealed significant growth in all areas as well as spread to the urinary tract and heart. Today, he moved to hospice care. He is still walking (a struggle), eating (very little), and is himself (unless taking anxiety meds which cause some confusion). I am very much heartbroken and I pray every day that they can stop this monster of a disease from eating people alive.

My mom has stage four renal cancer. And it’s time. I flew in Saturday morning, my brothers and I all said goodbyes and she said her piece to us and her dearest family and friends. She looked at the doctor and said I want to fall asleep and it be over. And that’s not how it works. I never thought much about the end stage. My only other experience with this- it was quick with how affected that family member was. But my mom? She’s strong. She’s so strong and the thing is no matter how ready she is my little brother and I are camped out in her room with her while she is still gasping for breath and on palliative care. She has the morphine pump that we have to fight and time on our phones when to beg the nurses for the next dose since they are so overwhelmed and short staffed so she does not wake up from her sleep choking and trying to make herself comfortable. She’s not scared I can see it. But she’s upset. She’s angry. She wants to go and see her dad and leave us to grieve and it’s day 4 in the hospital and we can’t get a straight answer on how much longer this is going to continue. She’s only 62. She was so healthy. This cancer has already taken so much from us and now she can’t even pass with dignity and we have to wait for nature to take its course while I sob every time she chokes or sputters if the medicine doesn’t hit on time or it’s time for one of the timed whatever’s. She’s fought a good fight. And while I honestly never thought she wouldn’t beat it… we are all ready. She deserves peace. So my baby brother and I will continue to watch her and be here for her while our dad takes one night to go home and collect himself before he rejoins us in our vigil.

My mother was diagnosed on Monday after 3 months of trying to find a diagnosis for her intense pain, and was immediately put into palliative care without any talk of treatment (at least not spoken of to me), just put on painkillers (and she has to wear a neck brace because the doctor fears paralysis will happen, but so far no paralysis).

I guess I'm just looking for some answers, because although I get that my parents have/had different types of cancer, this just seems so extreme to me.

My beloved fiance is a 32 yo male diagnosed about a year ago with 3b squamous cell right lung cancer. He had chemo (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation last year and has been on immunotherapy (Imfinzi) since, with a brief pause for a course of steroids to clear up some pneumonitis. We recently found some new mets in local lymph nodes - all in his right lung except one supraclavicular node. He’s being offered a few treatment options moving forward, and I wonder if anyone here has been through any of this stuff or just has a little 2 cents to give us that might make things more clear. Of course this is his decision to make, and I will support him completely in any case. 

In short, we fully expected surgery to be off the table when we learned that this new lymph activity was definitely metastatic. We were surprised this week when the surgeon on his case offered him a pneumonectomy with lymph node removal, which we would follow with more chemo and radiation as soon as he is recovered enough to handle it. He told us that, while this is a very radical operation, he thinks it offers him a chance at a total cure. He also said that the most recent good literature regarding mortality rates was from 20 years ago and showed about 5% mortality from the surgical complications within 90 days, but that he has never lost a patient from complications in that period. He is only willing to do it because my guy is so young and otherwise healthy, and because his cancer hasn’t spread far in the past year. He suggested that this indicates that his particular cancer is less likely to spread quickly.

We saw his medical oncologist immediately after, and she basically cautioned us against this. Her concern is that the lymph spread indicates that this cancer is already “out of the bag.” She says it hasn’t spread far because of all the treatment he’s getting. She’s worried that he will have this huge operation and be in pain, short of breath, etc and then have a tumor pop up somewhere else immediately after surgery that she couldn’t do anything about. She is suggesting a palliative plan instead - more chemo and immunotherapy but with slightly different meds. When his disease progresses a bit, he would be eligible for a clinical trial she is currently running with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. She thinks this could be a great fit for him, and may offer some hope of beating this thing. Still, it would basically mean moving him from a potentially curative track to a more palliative one. She also had another thoracic surgeon, who is a friend of hers, call him to give another opinion. That second surgeon said she thinks the mortality risk after this procedure would be more like 20% in the following 90 days because he has already gotten so much radiation, making the surgery more complicated. I don’t know if she’s basing this on any literature or if that 20% would include mortality from surgical complications alone or cancer progression as well - he talked to her when I was at work. 

He is currently at Northwestern in Chicago, and the second surgeon we talked to was at University of Chicago. We have requests in for appointments at Rush Chicago (where he was seen when first deciding where to pursue treatment), MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and Mayo to try and get some more expert opinions. As of now, he is planning to get the surgery May 2 and has started all his pre-op testing, signed the consent, etc. Still, he’s waffling. That second surgeon’s opinion definitely made things more difficult.

Any input? Advice? Experience with pneumonectomy, or any cancer surgery after lymph involvement and/or after radiation, or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes? We are determined to get the best medical and surgical advice possible, but would love a little perspective from other patients if possible. Thanks! Sending lots of love and well wishes to you all.",DunkinLove,t3_u540p1,14,2022-04-16 18:30:56,7,u540p1

He was a heavy smoker which failed to quit smoking for several times, until in the late June that he suddenly felt fatigued and dizziness with balancing problem that we later learned that he had over 30 spots of brain metastases and the primary sources was from his lung.

He was admitted to the hospital due to brain edema and had the whole brain radiation for 10 times, due to so many brain met that cannot be resect then chemotherapy and immunotherapy for his lung. He was doing just fine. The follow up MRI brain on September was showing a good response as nearly all the tumor has shrunk and gone, with the largest ones less than 0.5 cm. He was scheduled to have the MRI again in April, this month

In February, he started to have problems with his walking and balance. His memory was getting worse. We thought that it was because of the effect of whole brain RT because the recent CT showed that lung tumor is smaller but it’s actually not, he was having recurrent brain met, over 30 spots in the brain again. It’s a poor prognosis of disease, that he will likely be dying from the brain met instead of his primary lung ca.

The doctor said he couldn’t get the whole brain RT as it’s just about 8 months from his last one. Instead, he would get the palliative RT for some tumors in brain that is causing him trouble with gait and walking. He was on steroid after the RT and the doctor had increased the doses of dexa from 2 to 3 to 4 tabs per day as his symptoms wasn’t improve. Now with the 4 tabs dose of dexa for about a wk, his symptoms is getting worse, he feels sleepy all the time and all he does is to eat and to sleep. He starts to lose his strength and the problems with his walking is worsened. When he sits for a little while, he just dozing off again.

I really don’t know why he was getting so sleepy. I wonder if it was the steroid that is not enough for the brain edema after RT or Is it the disease progression. I just don’t know what to do or what to expect now. I know that it was the aggressive type of ca but still it’s too fast. I was hoping that he will get better after the RT and he could continue to live for at least two to three month before the disease progression but it’s not. The RT didn’t seem to help. I feel so desperate.

Sorry for my bad English. I don’t know who I can I talk to as no one I know has experience about this situation. Any comment or advice would be appreciated.",inksquad13,t3_u8o7g0,6,2022-04-21 13:55:04,3,u8o7g0

She had 542,000 copies per ML of Epstein-Barr virus (a typical carrier has less than 200). The plan was to use rituxin to target the virus-laden B-cells which were causing the tumors. 

A pet scan showed a lesion on her liver, dozens of tumors in her lungs and many dozens more in the subcutaneous fat layer of her abdomen, pelvis and thighs. 

She did a four-infusion series of Rituxin. It made her weak and confused, to the point where she fell out of bed and sustained a concussion, two black eyes and a large bruise on her arm. 

She was hospitalized and  was found to be severely anemic and to have a very low platelet count. She graduated to a rehab center and after 10 days of PT and OT, she was sent home. 

My parents are fortunate to have plenty of money, a cleaning service, and two sons and me who ensure that groceries are bought and pillboxes are filled and everything is taken care of. 

It’s been several weeks since her last infusion. She has weekly blood tests and her hemoglobin and platelet scores are slowly creeping towards normal. They still aren’t there. The rest of her blood scores are normal. Her blood pressure, metabolic panels, everything else is good. 

Up until she had trouble breathing in January, she was a healthy exercising 81-year-old. 

She had a follow-up pet scan and the lesion on her liver, the tumors in her subcutaneous fat layer and many of her lung tumors are gone. There are a few new nodules and some of the old ones have grown and now she has a lesion on her spleen. So it is a mixed result.  The Oncologist now thinks she has both NHL and her disorder. 

Her oncologist suggested R-CHOP as the next step. My mom refused it.  Oncologist said there is nothing else they can do for her and suggested hospice. 

She is sleeping 18 hours a day, has very little appetite and is still mentally foggy. She stopped taking her anti-depressants. She refuses to go outside and sit in the sun with my dad and brother (something she used to love to do). 

She has stopped returning calls and texts. 

She flip flops on hospice, says she is ready to die but then gets angry when palliative care workers want to help her. 

I read about the last months of life and that matches how she is acting but she has no pain, and is breathing well. 

Her Epstein-Barr load hovers between 12,000 and 70,000. 

I am all for her having autonomy and agency in her life and I am at a loss about how to support her. 

Do I insist she eats more? Do I let her fade into oblivion? 

Am I missing something here? 

For the record, she has always been a difficult person. I want to do right by her, but what is right?",Earlybp,t3_u9zebi,8,2022-04-23 06:47:45,6,u9zebi

Technically, she’s stage III (not sure of the term after that, whether it’s a, b, etc, but the oncologist is treating her as stage IV…She has some other serious underlying issues which have been there for a while, that is affecting how her oncologist is recommending treatment. 

She has a 5.9cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Unfortunately, she has a calcified blockage in her left leg, so endoscopy surgery is out. This only leaves open surgery. The surgeon we spoke with who was going to perform the surgery just this past January, laid out quite the risk in her case; the anatomy of the aneurysm itself, makes it more complicated than most. She just has too many other blockages in other places, making this a very risky surgery. With all the possible risks, she decided to forego the surgery.  But that also means, the bigger it gets, the more likely it will rupture, which has a very high mortality rate, most people don’t make it to the hospital. 

Second issue is her heart. She has an ICD, and it shocked her 4 times in March. She was admitted into the hospital on April 8 and they confirmed she had a heart attack. Her heart function in February was 35%, and was down to 30% by April. The other complication was that the PET scan done in March, showed her tumour was 4cm. By her April admission, it had doubled in size. She has a blockage in her heart but ANY procedure is too risky, so they are not stenting her heart. 

The oncologist will not do radiation, as the cancer is close to her heart. He is too worried about chemo, as it’s too hard for her heart and can risk rupturing her aneurysm. He’s given the option of Keytruda, but she’s just not sure. She has too many issues and I think she wants to enjoy her time as much as possible.  She still is doing well, she’s still working. She’s getting palliative care ready but def not ready for hospice.

We've had 5 years cancer-free. That's a lot, I know that. He has other health issues but it's still been 5 years more with my dad, and for him with his grandson. About a month ago he had some tests and they have confirmed the cancer is back and has local metastasis into the soft palette and lymph nodes. They can't do more radio, chemo is still a no-no and he has basically 0 chance of survival for the only surgical option, which would be a minimum of 19hrs on the table, with only a small chance at success, so he was put into the palliative care program. They have so far only given a loose estimate: 'it won't be days or weeks, but it won't be years'.  I think I adjusted to that.   


But now, just a few weeks later, I'm not sure they won't change it. He can barely eat (living on the shakes and occasional yogurt), he's lethargic and agitated. I'm watching the weight drop off of him. Every day I go in and he looks more jaundiced. He is in constant pain and I can see the sadness in his eyes and the way he sits... My family is so bad at this all.   


Normally when a relative dies I'm the one who is there for people, like with my grandparents, even my folks came to me because I was the most 'okay'. I love my family and I love looking after them. But this time idk how to. I'm an only child for all intents and purposes, with a young son of my own to watch over through this one, and of course my mum. But I'm not sure I'm strong enough. For the first time, I don't know how to be.   


I want so badly to go to him right now and hug him, but my family isn't a big one for PDA and I just CAN NOT add to his sadness by making him think I won't be okay. But it's all I want in the world. To hold him and tell him I'll be okay after I'm not, and he doesn't need to worry and that I love him. But I think it would break him. I feel guilty for holding that back, from him and my mum. For holding in the worry but I can't tell them, because I want to be okay for both of them. I don't want them to be alone. To top it off, outside of this my life is better than it has been for a while, and I feel guilty when I go out and enjoy myself. I feel bad for letting go of what is otherwise a constant ball of sadness and worry and loneliness. I'm fine most of the time but then I go in to spend time with him and see how much he's faded in a few days, or watch him in pain when he even tries to talk, watching that sadness and that fear wash over his face... Mostly I'm fine. But when I'm not, I am REALLY not. I find myself grieving to the point of exhaustion. I'm tired just from emotions and we're not even confirmed to be that close to the time. I am not sure how to hold on, but I don't ever want to have to let go. There's so much I want to say to him, and I don't know how without breaking down and making it worse for him, so I don't.   


I don't know where to turn or what to do, other than come here and post a mile-long message of things I can't say out loud or to anyone who knows me and hope that someone, somewhere, feels the same. I don't need answers, I think I just need to not be alone in being the fixer, in needing to be strong and fine for everyone who needs me, even if to do that I need to sometimes go out and let that side of me go so I can recharge.",WampusFox,t3_udy8x6,10,2022-04-28 15:56:03,15,udy8x6

My grandmother, the woman who raised me, was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer 3 days ago. Palliative care gave us a timeline of *maybe* two weeks. It has spread throughout her entire body, brain, spinal column, almost every internal organ.. I’ve seen her age so rapidly over the last month. We caught it so late.

Today I went to visit because my aunt said she thinks she might not make it through the weekend. 

She goes in and out. We were talking and she will look at me, mouth drooping with dead eyes, grab me and shout “I’m not ready to die! I don’t want to die!”, “I’m scared! Help me please” Over and over. Then continue our conversation. She pointed next to me and said “does Marty know I’m dying?” Marty is her husband who passed 5 years ago.. she also mentioned seeing her deceased mother sitting at the end of the bed. 

She told me “I want to die in my sleep”, I said “you will nana, it’ll be like a dream”. She laid down and fell asleep while I rubbed her back, she turned over eventually and told me “your touch is so gentle and comforting, I want you doing this when I go”. 

She hasn’t passed yet. She’s very scared. She kept telling me how scared she is and I feel helpless because all I can do is watch as she dies. 

I’m grateful I have this time though. I am very grateful I can love her and paint her nails, brush her hair and decorate her room for her. I know she will go soon. I just don’t want her to be afraid.

Im not sure what I’m looking for, I guess I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I’m in shock after my visit today, that was fucking hard.

I was initially diagnosed in November 2020, with an 8cm tumor in my leg. Four months of tests and scans later, they took out the tumor with clear margins. My oncology surgeon said it was a Paraganglioma, a rare type of High Grade Neuroendocrine Tumor, which some doctors do not consider to be cancer (?!!!). I asked whether some blood tests to be done, which are usually required for Paragangliomas. My oncologist refused and yelled at me, saying only HE can demand tests, it's not up to me to ask for tests. He insinuated I was taking advantage of the system, as I ""had gotten more scans and tests than any Canadian citizen"" (I'm an immigrant - and surprisingly, so is he!). It was alarming to get yelled at, so I backed down (the nurse, bless her, later on put me in touch with an Endocrinologist, who requested said tests without me even asking). 

Because the surgery was with clear margins, they said I was cancer free. See you in 3 months. Three months later, in July 2021, they did another set of scans. Still ""clear"", see you in SIX months. Six months later, December 2021, it turns out they were wrong and I don't have a Paraganglioma- they still don't know what i have for sure till today. I came for scans and found mets everywhere - my bones, my abdomen, multiple mets in both lungs. The bone mets caused a microfracture and I needed a nail inserted immediately. I am in a lot of bone pain. The abdomen mets were a 6cm tumor (have grown to 11cm by March 2022 when my first line of treatment failed spectacularly).

Now I'm finding out, when reading my past reports, that in July 2021, the scans showed a few mets in my lungs,already a few mm big. I asked the oncologist about WHY they didn't do anything about them then, and he says they were not visible on the images. But the REPORT says there were visible spots. If yes, then WHY didn't they ask to see me in 3 months? Why move the meeting to 6 months?? 

I know I should have read the reports. I was too trusting, and I didn't. I was also being followed by another hospital, and I sent them the reports as well, but they didn't read it/didn't catch it either. And now I am so fucked, the mets keep growing and nothing seems to be stopping them. I switched to another oncologist, but he won't tell me Anything (didn't tell me I now have mets in my spine), he is so closed mouthed about shit, I fear he might send me to palliative care to die without even telling me in my face that things haven't worked (he's done this to another patient). 

I mean, stage 4 is stage 4, right. Given that I always had an unknown primary from the very start, it can be argued that I was always stage 4, even back in November 2020 (they never told me the stage then). But stage 4 with a few lung mets just sounds a lot more ""manageable"" than Stage 4 with so many freaking mets! One could argue that I got like 6 more months of ""peace"", unaware of the madness already growing inside. But man, I am just so mad. At the oncology surgeon, who kept smugly saying even at our last appointment that he ""always knew that something was off with this tumor"".

They were optimistic given the abdominal cavity showed no trace of cells. She did 3 rounds of FLOT chemo, 25 days of radiation as part of a clinical trial, then surgery, and 4 more rounds of FLOT. Apparently the chemo and radiation had little impact on the tumor.  


She got a blood clot after the surgery, not a good sign. Since then, she hasn't improved. A month ago she had fluid build up in the lungs. We recently found out there are cancer cells in the fluid. Just like that she got bumped up from stage II to stage IV.   


It's so surreal. I can't wrap my head around the fact that any chemo or treatments from here on out are just palliative. It makes me think if she had not done the radiation as part of the clinical trial, she might have had her stomach removed sooner, and those rogue cells might not have travelled to her chest cavity. Of course, this is unproductive thinking.

My dad had problems with his colon (didn't go the restroom for about a week) and got hospitalized the second time he went to the ER where he got an urgent surgery. Well it turned out to be stomach cancer which metastasized a ""little"" bit (that's what they said) in this area. At this stage they are talking about palliative care.

I'm confused. We have not spoken with the oncologist yet because he needed to rest after the surgery. The only thing they said was he'll get a catheter for his chemo meds. He has lost SO much weight in this 3 weeks being hospitalized and his appetite vanished (no chemo yet!).

I don't even know what to ask I'm just confused and sad watching him in this state.  I try to attain  normal life while supporting him but I just reallyyy am confused by this process. We never got in touch with cancer before.

My MIL, 73, has NSCLC. Due to many other health issues (large abdominal aneurysm, aortic aneurysm, defibrillator/pacemaker), her only treatment option is Keytruda. The tumour was growing very rapidly (4cm to 8cm in one month). She’s had 2 infusions so far. She was given less than 6 months to live without treatment, back in February

The oncologist will be doing another scan after her third infusion, to see if it’s working. I, personally, don’t think it is, due to how much she continues to decline, and her pain factor (the tumour is pressing on nerves that is causing major arm pain, which has only gotten worse, I would think of the tumour was shrinking, it would get better?). 

She has lost 13 lbs in a month. Her appetite has really taken a dive, just these last two weeks. We’ve since added some things to her diet, in hopes to help. 

Is there a way to tell the difference between loss of appetite due to treatment, vs loss of appetite due to it being near the end of life? Palliative has been adjusting her pain meds, and added remeron for sleep/appetite stimulant.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an MRI early tomorrow to get an idea of whether or not I have salivary gland cancer. Reddit is so often a good resource for information so I did a search for it. In my search I found many posts from /u/RoxyBenedicto. She shared as much comfort and insight on this sub as she could, and found it for herself here many times herself as well. She has not posted in close to three years now so I have to assume that Roxy’s watch has ended.

(I didn’t know her personally but she was prone to using Game of Thrones references in her words of encouragement so I like to imagine that she would appreciate it.)  

&amp;#x200B;

The following is what resulted from me reading every comment and post made by /u/RoxyBenedicto from the start of her account to her final comment. I extracted bits that stood out to me; some significant and some subtle. Here is a snapshot of a stranger that I have quickly grown to love. 

Writing the following simultaneously met two of my contradictory needs at once: the need for distraction and the need for immersion into the fear I am experiencing.   

  

&amp;#x200B;

The Reddit account of RoxyBenedicto began nearly 9 years ago. She writes posts and comments about very average topics. Jobs. Camping. Dogs. Quitting smoking. She mentions having chronic anxiety. She reaches out to strangers with words of compassion. She gets pregnant and muses about the possibility of adopting a second child one day.  She gives details about her growing savings account, her mortgage nearly being paid off, her nearly completed bachelor's degree, and hopes of finding a career in her chosen field.

It’s nearly two years after the start of her account that she brings up having salivary gland cancer; around 7 years from today. She gives aftercare tips for radiation treatment. She is at Stage II. Her doctors seem to have eliminated the parotid tumors through radiation and surgery but there are concerning masses in her lungs. She is afraid but “ready to fight”.

She writes the following to a stranger in a cancer centered subreddit. I feel as if she is speaking to me.

“And here I am.  With you.  In the in between.  I hope that this is the worst part, the not knowing.  Whatever news may come, it will bring action of some kind.  That’s better, I think.  Sitting around waiting for Fate to show up is torture.

I wish you comfort and good luck for the days to come.”

Another year passes. She speaks to me again. 

“Imagine for a moment that you are the ruler of a castle.  You are a generous king/queen.  Your lands are peaceful, your people robust.  Life is feudal, agrarian bliss.   But then one day, a lookout from the tower spots a few shadows on a hill.  Nothing to be concerned about.  Just some peasant folk out for a picnic.  Then more shadows appear.  Perhaps a band of traveling musicians?  No.  It becomes clear pretty quickly that an unknown enemy is amassing forces in the distance.  Their numbers are formidable, their formation impressive.  You, dear Highness, were not prepared for this.  You feel helpless and stupid for failing to perceive this danger before it was able to get so close.  You look upon your enemy in its undisturbed, well rehearsed perfect battle formation and you are terrified.  This is what it feels like to get a cancer diagnosis.

Take heart, your Highness.  You live behind the 8ft thick stone walls of a motherfucking medieval castle and you have an army too.  (And a moat, surrounded by a thorn jungle patrolled by tigers.) Sure, this enemy had the advantage of surprise, but that’s over now.   Now, it’s time to gather your strength for the battle to come.  You will be brave, knowing of course that true bravery can only exist in the face of the kind of terror you will feel.  The kingdom will not emerge unmarred, but it’s not doomed either.

Try to take things one day at a time - that’s all we ever get anyway.”

She also says:

“There is no known standard of care that promises to decrease the chances of metastasis of this cancer.”

She works full-time. She cares for her child, her dog, her garden. Her two year old knows likes to sing along with “Can’t Help Falling in Love (with you)”. But the masses in her lungs have been confirmed as cancerous.

She posts mostly in the Cancer subreddit from here on. Primarily words of encouragement to others. I believe that she is trying to convince herself with the words she uses to convince others; that everything might turn out fine.

I won’t write it out but she comments on a reply that another user makes. Two paragraphs about not being afraid to die, but agonizing over the pain it will leave her loved ones. Trying while she still can to sew into them all the history and love and lessons that they will want to hold tight to after she is gone. “This is beautiful.” Roxy replies.

5 years ago she began chemotherapy. She is now stage IV. She joins a clinical trying for a medication new to the market. AskReddit queries: What stands between you and complete happiness? Roxy replies, “My cancer diagnosis.”

The cancer spread in such a way that her “facial symmetry is distorted”. Her prognosis has been “certain death” she says, but that treatment improved her condition and moved her back to “questionable”. She takes OxyContin for pain. Xanax for anxiety. ZoFran for nausea. Bottled Ensure to replace the food that she can eat after chemotherapy destroyed her taste buds.

She continues to post on the Cancer subreddit often. Her responses become more knowledgeable of processes, procedures, treatments, medications, side effects. Often with anecdotal evidence attached. Her encouragement is always just a bit more positive to those with more treatable types of cancer than her own.

Doctors have confirmed that her cancer has metastasized and is formally incurable. The “palliative” chemo had taken away her ability to effortlessly enjoy her son, dog, garden as she did a few years previously. She begins to mention doubt regarding the efficacy and sustainability of treatment. She still works so the bulk of her energy goes into her retail job.

She uses sarcasm to cope with rude strangers that ask about her surgical scars. She gives other parents advice on parenting with cancer. “Kids love to help. My son enjoys bringing me the thermometer and helping me take my temperature.”

Four years ago, she took a three month break from chemo and felt entirely herself again for that time. She has taken a leave of absence from work but fears her FMLA will be exhausted soon.

In response to a post, she wrote a long list of things she would like to do when she knows she’s reached the end. She’d like her father to read science fiction or fantasy stories to her. She wants to see a tornado up close, but doesn’t really know why. She wants to max out credit cards to make donations to worthy causes. There’s more, but those stood out to me.

She welcomes people without a formal diagnosis to the Cancer group, but also expresses the hope that they don’t have to stick around.

She has taken the full amount of FMLA that she is entitled to and her job status is no longer legally protected. Her job is, as she says, “awesome and has fantastic benefits”. She worries how they will pay the bills if she loses her job; how they will afford to carry on with treatment.

She says that she does not know if modern medicine can save her, or if she is “playing her violin on the deck of the titanic”. 

She advises an anxiety-ridden redditor to wait for scan results before panicking: “you need to know the shape of the monster before you can kill it.”

She has had persistent pain in her hip for months. She learns it has spread to her bones and muscles. She feels as if she is “very tangibly losing her battle”. She asks other redditors what she can expect with these new developments. She hopes for at least 5 more years. Her son will be 4 soon.

She frequently offers advice to other cancer patients on how to actively manage relationships and expectations. She encourages being clear with them because they will likely not know what to say or do. She empathizes with the frustration of having to do this.

Her Oncologist tells her that she will need treatment for the remainder of her life. She has surgically equipped a permanent port to her veins. 

Another year goes by. Another scan shows further growth. She is told to continue the treatment that makes her ill and doesn’t work. Instead of referring to her son as “toddler-age” she now says “preschool-age”.

She begins experimental clinical trials. Her hair has thinned. Her medications make her swell. Some organs unrelated to the cancer are taking damage from the chemo. She still makes comments to posts about treatment possibilities, but more often she makes suggestions about how to care for loved ones with cancer.

After 2 years of scans showing that the bone metastasis is spreading further, she is told that she has months left, not years. Shortly after she is told instead that many of her tumors have shrunk by as much 50%. This feels more like whiplash than relief.

Approaching death so rapidly but having a young child makes her disoriented, trying to understand what “stage of life” she is in. She files for SSDI and becomes well versed in medical privacy rights in order to retain employer medical benefits and evade discrimination. She mentions spending entire days in bed. Her next scan is encouraging and she allows hope to creep in.

In response to a post by a cancer patient with only weeks to live, she comments the entirety of “Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night” by Dylan Thomas. 

Hope for a cure is long since past. Her very best hope is to survive long enough for a yet unknown treatment to serendipitously emerge; something that might buy her a few more years, if it can only arrive in time. 

Sometimes she gives enthusiastic encouragement, urging others that the fight is worthwhile. She continues to congratulate those making hopeful progress. On a day she must have had less strength, she told one person, “I am sad and scared too. I want to say something that comforts you but I just keep staring at my blinking cursor.”

She begins seeing a counselor. Her main priority is making memories with her family. She reads up on new cancer research.

A scan shows it had spread to her spine. She develops colitis as a side effect of treatment. 

“Cancer has stolen pieces of my identity too.  I feel the voids left behind where parts of my identity used to be.  It’s a tremendous loss.”

“People ask when my treatment will end. It ends when it stops working. It won’t be over until I am dead.”

“My five year old doesn’t understand why I cannot play with him.”

After a failed treatment for pneumonia: “I can’t breathe and my doctors can’t tell me why”.

She “celebrates” her 10 year wedding anniversary with her husband, putting the word in quotes because they spend the whole day “doing medical stuff” (same as the previous 4 years, she says).

She buys her son the Bowser costume he wants to wear on Halloween. “Mom just doesn’t feel well”, they tell him.

Two and a half years ago she told the Cancer subreddit that she is now on oxygen and uses a cane to walk, but is very seriously considering a wheelchair. She describes her son as being very sweet and nurturing.

Not even weeks after, she leaves the last comment that she will write. In response to a stranger’s encouraging words she says:

For more infos, he has stage 4 NSCLC with bone mets on the hips and Sydrome of. Bourgeot-Sjören as a secondary effect that paralysed his face to some extent.

I have a lot of question and what they're saying on the internet isnt helpful to me and I dont know what to believe anymore. I dont know if I have to have hope or not and the bomb my cousin dropped on me is way too big.

Anyway, some of my questions are can Iressa actually make the cancer shrink ? Is it only palliative ? And is it the only drug used against EGFR positive and why would they choose this specific drug if there are other ones ?

He also can’t wait to rip out the pancreatic tumor.  

I’ve been lucky—I have extremely slow growing tumors so there’s no real rush, but they cause the most annoying symptoms.   

Finally, there’s light at the end of the tunnel.  

So since I’m young (37), he wants me to do some core exercises before the surgery to make recovery much easier on myself.  So he’s giving me two to three months and then we’re ripping them all out.

My husband and I were told that his mother has been suffering with gallbladder cancer for about 5 months. We were told she was having her gallbladder removed and there were complications during surgery (May). We were told about 6 weeks later that they found cancer in the gallbladder and was starting “preventative chemo” in case it had spread. Piecing information together it seems she has been doing palliative care since mid July when she was unable to complete chemo/radiation due to constant pain and sickness. She has been in the hospital a little over a month now, constantly in severe pain, extremely weak. She has been unable to eat or drink for months (she was given a pic line and then had a tube which she is still on). Her body is no longer retaining nutrients and the end is unfortunately near. She has decided to start hospice care at home in the next few days. She is getting a procedure first with a drain? My father in law is having a tough time communicating with us through the tears and being vague about some things. We have not been through this before so what I am wondering is what we can / should expect in the coming days/weeks? Would they have a timeline or suggest hospice at a specific point? I know some of her wishes and I know my FIL knows everything as well but I’m not sure how to start that process and feel it would be beneficial to have some bases covered in advance. As of now she is comfortable and able to speak, cognizant. but we haven’t been able to go see her. My husband is going tomorrow since it’s 1 visitor per day.

My wife has a recurrence of cervical cancer. Doctors are giving her 1-2 years with treatment. We're still processing but it's been an insane emotional rollercoaster these past several weeks. In early September we found out she has a tumor about the size of a nectarine near the base of her spine that's also encasing the arteries feeding her legs causing swelling, pain, and mobility impairment. We've been told the cancer is also in the lymphatic system but hasn't spread to other major organs yet. She's now being treated as a palliative patient to help improve her quality of life.

Her chemo treatment will include Carboplatin, Bevacizumab, and Paclitaxel, 6-8 rounds of treatment over the next 4+ months. She will also have immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab). She had her first treatment (7 hours of chemo + 4-hour blood transfusion) 5 days ago and a few days later, noticed terrible knee joint pain (burning and aching), extreme fatigue, and tingling/shooting pains mostly in the hands and legs/feet. After speaking with her pain management team, she has been prescribed Gabapentin (day 2 use and no signs of improvement). She's also taking hydromorphone and Tylenol to deal with the constant pain.  

Does anyone have user stories regarding these treatments that they'd be willing to share?  I know reaction cases can be different from person to person but perhaps hearing from those with experience might offer us some reassurance.

We're doing our best to maintain a positive perspective but it's been so challenging, especially this past week and we're very scared for what's to come recognizing that our time is so precious, now more than ever.

I did review with the family what inpatient hospice care would involve including continuing IV medications for comfort, discontinuing other medications, and discontinuing artificial nutrition.

My best friend was diagnosed with Lymphoma back in late January / early February. I've been doing my best to help her through it, but she's really suffering right now due to a weakened immune system along with worsening symptoms. If anyone has some insights or tips on how I can be more present for her, I'd appreciate your response, I also have a couple questions about her current situation.

 1. Due to a rash of extreme mouth ulcers she's having a hard time eating and drinking. She's been told to stay away from acidic foods and stick to soft foods. Just watching her try to eat breaks my heart, and I was wondering if any of you had any similar symptoms and what you were able to eat/drink to stay hydrated and nourished. Is there any medication the doctors might be able to assist her in getting for something like this?

2. She had a radiation rod put inside her after going through 2 rounds of radiation therapy, and that's coming out next week. We'll know after it's out and they do scans if there's any other treatment that can be pursued or if there's nothing that can be done besides palliative care. If palliative care is the only option, how can I help comfort her towards the end in a way that prioritizes her and her feelings?

I’m on a break from chemo as of a month and a half ago because my last scans came back NED. 

But within the last couple weeks, I’ve been experiencing chest pain, coughing, loss of appetite, and really bad shortness of breath. My oncologist didn’t take any steps to rule out the cancer coming back, just told me to go to the ER. There, they misdiagnosed me with pneumonia. I took antibiotics for over a week and it didn’t get better. I went back the other day and they did a CT scan — found a big growth in a lung and another growth in my chest. 

Now my oncologist has moved up my next PET scan to evaluate these growths, but it’s not for another week. 

This isn’t the first time that I’ve suspected a health issue was cancer-related and been blown off by my doctors only to later find that it was cancer. 

I’m afraid I won’t make it to the next scan, much less whatever treatment options there might be. I can’t walk a few steps without getting out of breath. I’ve had no appetite. I can barely sleep.

Well, today that changed.

To give some backstory: My grandma (72F) has been having some vaginal bleeding for the last year, she never wanted to get it checked out, out of fear of doctors and having to get poked around by them. 

Well, she got admitted to the hospital last month for some chest pain, which turned out to be a heart attack and they placed 2 stents. She was doing ok and 2 weeks later she got discharged. That small window of hope was around thanksgiving and it was great.

But then the Tuesday after she was having shortness of breath and gasping for air so I called 911. They took her to another better hospital in the area and they found fluid in her lungs and 2 clots in her legs and one in her lung. They put her on Lasix and heparin for about a week but then yesterday night she was placed in the ICU as her blood pressure dropped very low and her HR was low. They were able to stabilize her. 
After further testing and ct scans, they found a mass in her uterus, it’s metastatic uterine cancer and it spread to her lungs. They are almost 100% sure she is at a stage 4 cancer but they aren’t able to verify through a biopsy because my grandma is too weak to have it done.
Today the doctors had a meeting regarding the next steps for my grandma and they discussed that chemo and radiation would be too much for my grandmas body. So, the plan is to now move my grandma to palliative care unit and just try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The doctors explained that the reason why she probably got the heart attack was due to the cancer causing the clots. 

My parents and my grandpa signed the DNR/DNI today.

I can’t help but feel guilty that I did not push my grandma more to get her bleeding checked out or push my mom to push her to get checked out. My mom did try but my grandma is a stubborn person. I am trying to cope with this but it’s so hard to see my grandma so weak and frail, she was fine a week ago. Honestly f*ck cancer 
I’m trying really hard to be strong for my mom and grandpa, but my heart feels so heavy:(

I wanted to reach out to the community for advice.  My 85 year old mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer a couple of months ago.  It spread to her spine and the surgery to remove the mass was successful.  She’s done a round of radiation to her spine to prevent further spread and it looks good.   Now her battle is the lung cancer itself for which she has the EGFR - L858R (Exon 21) mutation.  

The docs have given her Tagrisso, touting it as a wonder drug that will extend her life considerably. They give her between a year and possibly three with Tagrisso.

They are not considering other treatments, whether it be surgery, clinical trials, etc. The focus is on palliative care and not much beyond.  I guess they figure she’s had a good ride at 85, and any set of options might intrude on her quality of life; or looking at the dark side of things, it’s possible they don’t want to devote further resources on a woman of advanced age.  My mom however, is a warrior and while she accepts her fate, she wants to explore other options and that’s why I’m here.  This is new to me and I am starting the process of getting my arms around it.

What do you folks say?  Has anyone had experience with EGFR - L858R and can suggest other avenues to explore?  Links to promising studies? General advice caring for a loved one with EGFR is welcome too.  Thanks all and hope you all are doing OK as we approach the holiday season.",MadGeographer,t3_zmb8ya,0,2022-12-15 03:46:02,4,zmb8ya

With that sort of prognosis without chemo should I assume it’s palliative chemo?",expertrainbowhunter,t3_zor2ql,13,2022-12-18 05:33:09,5,zor2ql

My dear mom has been fighting this little f\*cker for over 4,5 years now, but has been mostly feeling alright; a hysterectomy, 3 rounds of chemotherapy and 1 round of Avastin included. She has grown her own weed and it really helped with almost all of her symptoms. However, she went from 1000 mg metamizole per day to continuous elastomeric pump infusion in a span of this last month and from eating the whole meal to barely eating 1/3 of a pudding. 

She had been hospitalized in our main national oncology hospital (palliative care) for a few days last week to get her pain under control, but there the throwing up started. Her doctor said it must be the obstruction of the intestines, despite not confirming it with the imaging diagnostics (they x-rayed her 2 times during these 5 days), so the doctor said my mom should only consume liquids from now on and not use any laxatives or had the enema administered. They had also added some meds in the mix to prevent the ""intestinal juices"" from forming, which apparently made her puke so often. 

Anyway, my mom is home now and due to almost not eating anything at all and the mix of very strong meds, she is constantly suffering from heartburn and dry mouth, so I guess I am writing here to get maybe some tips from the people who have more experience with this condition and its symptoms. What do you think I could get my mom to eat? Are there some meds (drops, preferably, not pills, as she has very upset stomach already) or some other tricks that could help with the heartburn and dry mouth? Any help would be much appreciated, as this could significantly improve my mom's current condition.

The doctor said she has about a month to live, but I have a strange feeling something about her doctors' diagnostic approach and their prediction was off. Unfortunately, as we come from a small EU country, I have no idea, where we could even look for a second opinion??",silvestri-h,t3_zpne4b,3,2022-12-19 09:51:21,4,zpne4b

One of my best friends has stage four tongue cancer, messaged me very upset that she has neuropathic pain and was given too much morphine. My friend asked me to search online what can be done to help her for pain management. She was initially diagnosed two years ago and last year they told her that it’s stage four. My friend lives in France and is having treatment there, at first she had chemo then she had radio therapy. She also has done all types of thc and cbd but they are illegal and gray area in France. She has a feeding tube and another that I cannot recall what it’s for. 

She is 44, 5’4’’ 100 pounds. Right now in a day she takes 710 mg of morphine. I wentI went back and read her message twice she said 710 mg and is shocked it is so much. She had been in a hospital for three weeks for testing including MRIs because she has neuropathy. And the time in the hospital they kept increasing her morphine for comfort but she felt like they overdid it and now she wants to wean herself off of such a high daily amount. The reason being is she wants to function and have her mind. She was previously offered a fentanyl patch and declined it. If there are pluses and minuses comparing between fentanyl and morphine. 

If anyone can share anything that can be helpful, I really appreciate it. She has been fighting so hard. 

I am not new to pain management, palliative care, and hospice. My mother was hospice for eight months until she died last December. My friend knows this and usually I’m capable of answering questions for her but asking about weaning is new to me. It’s just it in France they’ve given her boxes and boxes of morphine with a little instruction.",Estrella_Rosa,t3_zqab1l,17,2022-12-20 01:33:15,2,zqab1l

When would it be appropriate? Do I gather people and tell them all at once or one by one?

I've developed jaundice and I have only 2 surgery options that will probably not even work out in the end. I've made it through one of these kinds of surgeries before, the ""you have little chance of survival"" surgeries, but it's still scary going into them knowing a failure means the end. I need to prepare the people in my life for that end, but it's tough to tell people as they're all celebrating their holidays!

I suppose I know who to tell first, it's just the others, the casual people in my life that I'm not sure what to say to haha. I wish all of this was easier. I wish the jaundice wasn't such a big deal given my circumstances. 

I just wanted to vent, I suppose, thank you for listening  I posted this in a private chat and they were all so worried abt me being set up with palliative care so I just wanna say I've got it haha, had a team working with me since the beginning, and they've been incredible to me.

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

I don't want to put her through needless pain in a quest to extend her life. She deserves peace and dignity. What is the best treatment method?,"We discovered this news from a mammogram.
 A biopsy was performed and we are waiting for the result which is due in 2 days. Will add an update about biopsy report soon.

Doctors are suspecting stage 2 breast cancer (yet to be confirmed). Doctors are also suggesting a unilateral mastectomy. My grandmom is insisting that she doesn't want chemo. Our well wishers are also suggesting that it would probably be less painful for her to not opt for chemo at all and take up morphine during later stages when it may  get painful. A family friend also feels breast cancer is actually not painful until stage 4, hence it is probably better if we could let her be, especially since breast cancer takes time to spread in elderly patients. Also a breast cancer survivor said to me that chemo actually makes things worse than cancer and is worth opting for only if you are young and plan to live for your family.

But I feel that palliative chemo could actually make things less painful for her. 

So far docs suggested chemo and radiation as well, but we are planning on meeting a specialist with the biopsy report. (Will also add an update about his suggestions)

I am posting here to gather info about personal experiences and recieve suggestions from people who have been through the fight against breast cancer. What could be the best approach to treat a person with stage 2 cancer when... 

We want to preserve her dignity and quality of life and also not let her go through physical pain? We are not focussed on increasing her life span, we prefer she lives peacefully for as long as this lasts. I know that there is no perfect solution for this, but what could be the best possible solution? Also, what else should we be prepared for in future? Any input about treatment for elderly breast cancer patients would be welcome.

Update: got the biopsy report today. Impression in report is signet ring cell carcinoma in right breast. We might meet an oncologist day after tomorrow

Update 2: met an oncologist today who suggested a mastectomy and adviced against reconstruction. He said that decisions about chemo can be taken after surgery. He also said that mostly chemo may not be required and surgery could be sufficient as cancer may not be very metastatic at her age. He said that he wouldn't prescribe a chemo regimen unless her situation worsens. ( We did not say anything at all or voice our fears about chemo during appointment. It was a short appointment.)

Also spoke to my gran today about her condition finally! Told her things will be fine and that she will be okay.

Keeping our fingers crossed and hope things workout for her well.",painfreelastlife,,28,2018-11-12 09:58:32,2,9wcs47

I would like to ask you, all , what to expect, your experience, opinions on treatment,   and what's ahead for my mom and what should I and family prepare for. She is 62, was diagnosed with stage IV couple weeks ago as initial diagnosis.  Her results are, multiple MTSs in spine, 2 broken vertebrae, 2 more affected , MTSs on ribs. All other organs and bones are clean, except the right side LUs and the LUs near spine.   So bone metastases only.
Invasive lobural carcinoma,  grade 2, HER2 negative,   ER and PRO positive (100% and 90% strong reaction respectively). 
P53 negative, KI-67 below 20%.

She is in lot of pain from bone metastases, now using fentanil patches and flector/novalgen analgetics. 
Treatment: She had 1 phase (5days) of palliative  radiotherapy for spine, we hope this helps with the pain.
No more radiotherapy was suggested now and they said to wait 2-3 weeks for full effect.
No chemo, but hormonal therapy with Letrozole.  Denozumab or Ribocillib to be started next week.

Basically I would like to know, is this the right course of action, can I expect she will get better/pain free , and walk again as now she basically get up from bed only when absolutely needed.  What is the normal time to get results of RT if it works and when is usually the check if the cancer is not progressing ? I know the hormonal therapy  can take longer time for results. And of course , what are her real chances with above results ? Overall she is strong and in fighting mood but there are of course bad days too.
Thank you all",Dc-sewer,,6,2018-12-07 23:29:11,5,a45ekj

My best friend was initially diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago in her late twenties. She went through chemo, surgery, radiotherapy. It was bad. Large aggressive tumor, poor response to chemo, cancer in her lymph nodes.

A few years passed since the diagnosis, she is now in her early thirties. She was taking hormonotherapy and started reconstructive surgery. But a few days ago she sought out medical attention for severe back pain and there it was. The cancer has come back, it has metastasized to a bone.

I know this means it can't be cured. Nobody knows exactly how long she might still live. Hopefully, it's years rather than months. But it won't be enough years, and it will be challenging ones. I have worked with oncologists and palliative care providers so I have some inkling of what's next, in theory anyway.

I don't think I need to say how terrified and heartbroken I am. We have been friends for a long time and I always expected we would be friends until death did us part, but I pictured us having white hair and grand-children by then. Yet it also appears to me that those months or years are so incredibly precious. They are all we have left.

I know everyone is different and what's ""supportive"" to one person might be unwelcome for someone else. Still, I'm willing to hear about anyone's experience, hear about what was the most helpful to you or to a loved one you supported, or get video/books suggestions... What have you.

Six months ago today I (F31) was diagnosed with breast cancer. 

In the rollercoaster of examinations that followed, we only got more and more bad news. The doctors found several metastasis and pulled all initial treatment plans. I'm now getting palliative hormone treatments instead.

In one conversation with my doctor, I was told that if left untreated I should be very glad if I made it another 6 months. That was quite a shock. 

I remember the first time I ordered vitamin supplements (trying to do everything and anything in my power to contribute) and the store offered a discount if you purchased 3 packs. That would take me about 3 months to go through. I didn't take the deal, because I wasn't sure if I'd live that long. 

But it's now been six months and I'm still here.

I'm still here.
And I'm so thankful for every single day I've had since then. Not every day was a good day but overall, looking back, I feel so blessed with all the love I have in my life.

The treatment I'm getting now is working better than expected. It's the first good news we've had since the diagnoses. Now, I've finally gained some perspective. I'm finally able to make plans again a bit further away in the future. I've even made a semi large purchase for myself last month!

Apologies because I feel like I've been doing panic posts, but oh well.

tl;dr : do the effects of Ibrance and fulvestrant get better over time or if it starts out shitty, is it pretty much consistently shitty for the duration of the treatment?

My mom (80) had a recurrence of breast cancer and has bone mets in several places.  The doctor started her on fulvestrant and Xgeva shots around the 18th of May, then she started Ibrance on the 23rd of May.  She had been pretty ok up to that point but about two or three days later took a nosedive with terrible nausea and weakness.  She's on zofran for nausea, percocet for pain, and we've been experimenting with marijuana.  She just can't seem to get herself to drink much or eat almost anything.  She's lost a ton of weight (and wasn't heavy to begin with).  When she went for her 2 week loading dose of fulvestrant she had high kidney levels and was dehydrated, so she got fluids and the doctor took her off the Ibrance for now and told her to stop taking Advil which she had been using to control the pain (hence the increase in reliance on percocet).  Since then she really hasn't improved much at all, and seems to be getting worse.  She's said a few times now that she just wants to be put in the hospital and then a nursing home, because there will be a team of people there available to just ""take care of her"".  Let me say although she's 80, she never strikes me as an ""old lady"" so it's not like she's some helpless little old lady and we're just trying to push her around, but she is generally pretty lazy and resigned about things.

I think she's feeling discouraged and thinks this is just what it is to die of cancer. The doctor never gave us an actual timeline and was relatively upbeat about her diagnosis, so I get the sense that if it was really that bad he wouldn't have even recommended treatment (I have a call into him to try to get a sense of that).  So I really can't figure out if this is all a result of the treatment, as well as the snowball effect from not drinking and eating and moving.  At this point she's incredibly weak and can't move around much, and really doesn't want to be left alone.  Individually, her symptoms are all somewhat manageable with a lot of effort (the pain is pretty much under control, she's generally sleeping ok, the marijuana helps her anxiety) but as a whole it's all just too much for her to handle - I think the weakness in particular seems to be the biggest problem because it's leaving her unable to do anything for herself.  I also think she's starting to suffer a bit from withdrawal from the percocet if she doesn't take it regularly.  I'm trying to be over there as much as possible (currently a few hours every day) but she simply won't help herself to do ANYTHING when someone is not there pushing her to do it - I leave her with all sorts of snacks and beverages and smoothies and protein shakes and a full vape pen, and when I come back the next day it's all still sitting there on the coffee table.  I called the palliative care place and they're going to try to connect me with a rehab facility, because I thought if they could get her hydrated, fed, and moving around more, and maybe even give her some counseling, she might feel better and see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel (at least from this particular tunnel anyway).

I guess overall I'm not sure whether I'm being too naive about this just being a hump to get over before her quality of life potentially improves, or if this is really just it for her, in which case we should seriously consider just ending treatment and moving toward a hospice plan, but I want to give plan A it's due diligence rather than just throwing in the towel.

The one thing I was slightly encouraged about was that I think she had percocet withdrawal last night because she had only taken it first thing in the morning and hadn't taken it again because she had no pain, so I'm not sure if that's possibly a sign that one of the treatments is starting to help her bones.",complicatedshoes,t3_vax10q,7,2022-06-12 22:19:51,3,vax10q

Four years later it showed up in the brain and there is no cancer to be found anywhere else in her body.","She was healthy and cancer was a distant memory. Then she had a seizure 4 weeks ago out of the blue. MRI and CT showed nothing remarkable. They sent her home. Over the next two weeks her balance and clarity deteriorated. Back into the hospital. A second MRI found cancer of the cerebrospinal fluid (carcinomatous meningitis) - not just a little bit, but ‘heavily caked’ everywhere. That is how fast is has moved. She was given weeks, not months. 

There really is no treatment for this. Bc the cancer spreads from the top of her brain to the base of her spinal cord, we would have to irradiate her entire body (except her limbs) just for palliative treatment. So she/we have elected to forego treatment. 

Steroids have helped restore clarity and some balance, but the cancer grows all the while. She is becoming more and more sleepy. Yesterday she was up for a total of 4 hours. But she ate, which is good. 

She has no pain. A mild headache that she refuses even Tylenol for. What a blessing. 

A full body scan looking for other sites of cancer came up with nothing. Even her breast is clear. But a lumbar puncture confirmed it is adenocarcinoma- from her breast. 

This is honestly perhaps the best case scenario. My mother is 80. She got to live a healthy, happy, full life. She did not spend years fighting and struggling with this cancer. But instead of dying suddenly, she has gotten several weeks – a victory lap of sorts -  where her entire family has gathered around her and showered her with love and care. It appears that for her the end will be getting sleepier and sleepier, until she just stops waking up.

I'm not really sure where to reach out to but this seems like such a supportive community. My dad was diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme over his left temporal lobe, directly over Wernicke's area. So his speech is incredibly impaired. 

He's at 22months now, which is spectacular beyond the 15 month average prognosis. 

He's had a major personality shift, and I know that's a part of it. He's a lot more aggressive, to the point of screaming at me and my mom. It's normally a bunch of incoherent streams of syllables, and when we don't understand, he throws a fit, often screaming more or tossing his walker around. 

He's a very smart man, and I know his intelligence is still there, but the lack of language skills is making him incredibly frustrated and act out.

Not that I have regrets about how we cared for him, but knowing what I know now, I wish we were able to ease into hospice sooner, before it felt like a critical moment to decide to do it.

Saturday morning, 911 was called and she became non-responsive. Saturday night they moved her to palliative care. Monday morning, she passed.

We're all still dealing with it and I'm just so glad I cancelled my meeting on wednesday to go see her. If I hadn't I would have never been able to talk to her or tell her I love her one last time.

I just needed to vent and thank everyone here for the help they gave in the past.",Bronnen,,6,2018-01-04 14:56:34,15,7o3gnt

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. 

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

As a thank you for your time, we will enter you into a prize draw where you could win a £50 Amazon voucher, or even an iPad Mini.

Thank you,

She's now 28 years old. My brother in law works night shift and is trying his best to be there for her at every waking moment.

She was diagnosed with a brain tumor 8 years ago. She's a fighter! She successfully endured radiation therapy at the onset. The tumor stopped growing... until last year, about Feb 2017. She was on chemo pills for about 12 months and in February 2018, the doctors said treatment's not helping and the tumor is growing again.

Last month (April) she had a dose of IV chemo which just made her more weak and hasn't slowed down the cancer.

Her energy level has gone from 9 to 1 in the matter of weeks. She was just diagnosed with 6 months to live.

As she received radiation earlier in life, doctors aren't willing/able to have her endure this treatment again. At least this is how I understand the situation. She can barely eat on her own. She doesn't speak, but motions in sign language for us to try and understand. Sometimes she's cognizant, sometimes delirious.

My brother in law has just filed for short term disability to be with her. She's now needing people to dress her, move her from room to room and literally support her. This lady's mother was told palliative care was required weeks ago, but this was never passed on to my brother in law or this lady's father (separated from her mother).

At this stage of her life, our entire family is devastated. My wife has been in tears constantly. We want to support our sister in law, be there for her and help her have little things to look forward to (even if it means getting a wheelchair and going for a little walk). We want to uplift her spirit and give her strength to continue the fight knowing that we are here for her and love for her immensely.

My sister in law has indicated some friends visited her, for their own feelings rather than to support her. I want to give her reasons to fight. To know that we care and love her dearly. To know that she hasn't been abandoned. And to give her reason to look forward to another day, week or year ahead.

My brother in law is a strong chap. But this is new to him, plus he's having to deal with awkward parents. He isn't yet married, so there's bound to be issues arising regarding personal care and also on a financial responsibility level. I hope to god he doesn't have issues with this as there isn't any will in place. The pain is punishment enough for everyone involved.

Someone out here must have had experiences similar to this. How did you support different sides of your family? How did you take care of the person going through the most difficult time of their life!?! How did you show support and encouragement? What can I do for my brother in law to give him peace of mind or maybe a few hours to escape? How can we make these (potentially) last months enjoyable??

When asked if she wanted palliative care, she looked at my brother in law and said ""I just want you to take care of me"". And I know he will. He loves her to infinity. And back. 

What can I, and my wife, do that will mean the most to the both of them?",Life0fKai,t3_8iv168,1,2018-05-12 09:41:32,10,8iv168

He was diagnosed with Glioblastoma only seven weeks ago and rapidly declined within that period of time. I feel like I never even had the chance to process he had cancer let alone having to deal with the fact that he’s gone. He was only 56. 

He presented to the ED on Boxing Day (26th December) with bad headaches and some confusion. Prior to that his only symptoms were some frequent headaches and neck pain in the weeks leading up, which he put down to possibly just having a virus. His scans showed the he had one 3x3cm tumour in the left frontal lobe and another in the centre of the brain. He had surgery a few days after he was admitted and they were only able to de bulk some of the tumour in the frontal lobe, but had to leave the other as it was too risky to touch it. Shortly after surgery when he went home he struggled with communication, became really irrational and did lots of odd things that were completely out of the normal for him. He was very withdrawn and didn’t really want to do anything or leave the house. 

A couple of weeks after he began taking the temodal and started his radiation treatments. The fourth radiation treatment in he was hospitalised again with vomiting, pain and eventually went into a coma like state for three days. Eventually he came back out of it and we decided to start treatment again, this time as an in patient rather than just attending the day clinic. They were able to do another MRI and said that the tumour they were not able to get to had tripled in size within a months time. A week after another lot of radiation sessions he again had lots of pain, vomiting and eventually slipped back into that coma like state. His oncologist told us that she just didn’t think he was reacting well to the radiation at all and that it was aggravating the tumour causing the brain to swell and bring on these unconscious like states. We were certain that was the end and the doctors agreed that he was palliative, put in the syringe driver and he spent another five days in that semi conscious state before coming good again and being the best we had saw him the entire time he was in hospital. He seemed more clear about things, more aware and we were able to have proper conversations like before. We ended up making the decision not to continue treatment and he was transferred to the hospice as per his wishes, to continue with pain and symptom management. 
Over those last two of weeks in the hopsice that good phase began to fade and he began to decline more rapidly again, he struggled to eat or feed himself, he was barely able to get out of bed and his ability to communicate was very limited only leaving him to be able to speak very small sentences or give one word answers often just repeating and mimicking things other people said. He never forgot who I was though, he always seemed thrilled to see me when I came in to visit, his humour stayed with him until the very end (whether that be making silly faces or little sarcastic comments) and he never failed to tell me he loved me each time I came. 

The days leading up to his death he was often in and out of consciousness a lot but received a visit off some players from his favourite football team the Sydney Swans which I think he really held out for and it absolutely made his day. On the Thursday he held my hand and managed to find the words to tell me how proud he was of me and how much he’d love me forever and always. Then on that Friday I came in to see him early after my step mum told me he was having a lot of frequent small tremors. we looked at photos, joked around, he wanted to give me lots of hugs and affection, we spent a really nice few hours together and then we told each other goodbye and I love you and I let him know I’d be back that night after work to see him again. I left at 1:30pm and he passed an hour after completely unexpectedly from a huge seizure. I think the hardest part is that I’d prepared myself time and time again for his death when I thought it was going to happen, only to have him go on a day completely unexpected. I really wanted to be there for him when he went but I guess he just wanted our last memory together to be a positive one instead. 

He was a beautiful, kind, caring and positive person who loved his family, his friends, his job and just his life in general. He radiated happiness wherever he went and he always saw the best in people. He didn’t deserve to go in this way or this soon. I think about how I wish he had the chance to be like the lovely little old men i care for at work because he would have been just as wonderful at 90. It’s going to be hard not having him around, but the last seven weeks were such hell for him that I’m just glad he’s not in pain anymore and hopefully is somewhere at peace. 

I’ve been reading this sub reddit since the beginning of all of this and it’s really helped me a lot. It really shows just how unfair this disease is and that it always seems to choose the ones that never deserve it.

Docs gave him 5-8 months, so he's definitely past that time frame.  Trouble is, my dad is stubborn and refuses to get palliative care, won't go to doctor's appointments and is refusing to give us any information about the details of his condition.  He says he cannot sleep (which seems backwards), has small seizures, and really bad headaches.  He sounds very lucid, but also super depressed.  He keeps saying he only has a few weeks left.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my Dad.  I don't live really close to him (about a 10 hour drive), so I haven't seen him since early February.  He says he gets really emotional all the time and breaks down crying--he says he is grieving his own death.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so frustrated because I just am so... helpless/unhelpful.  I'm too far away to be there much (I have young kids, a job, etc.), he won't tell me much and is very evasive with questions about his latest MRI, meds, etc.  He definitely has narcissist tendencies, so sometimes I get these ideas that maybe he is making it all up for attention--but he's never been an outright liar.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I visited him in February, he said and acted like it was the last time I'd ever see him.  Now that he's lasted longer than he predicted (end of February), I feel like I need to visit him again.... but I don't want to go through the goodbyes again... so I'm really dragging my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

It is having such an enormous emotional toll on me that sometimes I just want it to be over.  I feel horrible saying that--and I try to rationalize it by saying he is in so much pain that it will be his only relief.  It's like holding your breath, waiting for something bad to happen, and you just have to wait... with no way of knowing when it'll happen.  It's awful.

My mother was diagnosed with GBM in March. Had a partial resection and we learned that the cancer was worse than originally suspected. They left a Large tumour in brocas region of the brain that left her with aphasia. The other Tumour was near the motor strip which case much weakness on one side.   Follow up treatment was 15 sessions of palliative radiation. She’s 57 - 5 children and was a foster parent to +30.  A very independent caregiver who now can’t speak, cannot walk, and is dependent for personal care. It’s been a very painful season of life to say the least. 

I learned today that her creatine levels are low. I’ve noticed blood in her urine and that she goes hours without peeing. My question to you folks is what are your experiences with brain cancer and creatinine levels?  Would this be caused by brain functioning or cancer spreading?

Following dx she had a partial resection. Unfortunately it was much more progressed than originally thought. She lost her speech (main tumour was in broca region of the brain) and limited mobility on right side. The proceeded with targeted radiation (15 sessions) as they did not feel she was strong enough for radiation &amp; chemo combo. She was in hospital 8 weeks for surgery and radiation. Follow up mri showed gbm has spread to the other side of her brain and is growing outside the area they did radiation. Met with a new oncologist today who was direct in saying we are running out of options, that the other two physicians did not feel she was a candidate for chemo however she disagrees and feels we have nothing to loose. My father was quick to jump on the chemo wagon. I personally don’t want to put her through this but I’m so frustrated with the family conflict that I’m taking a step back from voicing my concerns (I already have a couple weeks ago). So here we are in the thick of things starting chemo next week along with a referral to palliative care. My questions are:

What were the side effects you experienced?

How long after taking chemo did you experience side effects (right away)?  Do the symptoms change when she has the weeks off?

The doctor said that 30% of folks have a reduction in symptoms- has anyone here had improvement with chemo? Or did it just maintain and extend time? 

Are there tips or words of wisdom to help guide through this process?

My original prognosis was incredibly grim, so every day I wake up alive is a miracle and a gift.  I am doing amazingly well for being a cancer patient, especially considering this type of cancer.  I really only have 2 symptoms, pain and seizures.

My tumor is located inside my thalamus which causes constant wide-spread pain throughout my body.  And because this pain is coming directly from my brain, tylenol, NSAIDs, ice, heat, rest don't do anything, only narcotic pain meds help.

I have a compassionate, understanding palliative care team, and they keep my symptoms very well controlled.  Most of the time, I can pretty much ignore my tumor.

When I have a worse pain day, I take more morphine, and since opioids lower the seizure threshold. and end up having more frequent and worse seizures.  My seizures are rather benign, I could have one standing right next to you, and you'd have no idea.  They are temporal lobe seizures that manifest as a very strange déjà vu, which I've come to describe as 'dreaming someone else's dream', followed by a feeling of impending doom.  

While I have no physical effects from the siezures, they make me very aware that this thing really is in my brain, and the fact that it is all but guaranteed to kill me one day.  This sends my anxiety through the roof, and heightened stress/anxiety can cause more seizures, which raises my anxiety more, and I get stuck in this terrible feedback loop.

Chemo never made my hair fall out, and I have managed to maintain a positive attitude through all of this.  So all I ever hear in my daily life is how good I look, or how inspiring I am.  That couldn't be farther from the truth.  I am a broken man just trying to do the right things.

So I guess I just wanted to vent to those who can actually understand where I'm coming from.  Brain cancer sucks.  If it was a person, I'd kick them in the shins, and give them a purple nurple.",thelemonx,,12,2019-12-22 02:05:03,56,edywfy

He was not a surgery candidate and did 3 weeks of palliative radiation + temodar. We tried one course of maintenance chemo but it wiped him out too much. In fact, he ended up in the hospital, then a nursing home, and then went home enrolled in hospice. 

In the hospital he was started on a new course of steroids. Now, about a month later, he is doing better than he has since his diagnosis. He’s cognitively more clear, and feels motivated to get out of the house. He has a hard time getting around, he’s pretty weak overall, so he is certainly limited.

Since he’s doing better, we scheduled the follow-up MRI and consults with oncology, radiation onc/neurosurgery (those two go together) that were planned before he went into the hospital and then hospice. My mother says Medicare (we are in the US) says he can’t be enrolled in hospice and continue with imaging and clinic visits. They only pay for one or the other. Is that true? I thought GBM was an exception to this since it’s not curable, plus his treatment has always been palliative.

With treatment, which we started about a week after the initial diagnosis, she has about 4-6 months.  She is 66 has multiple comorbidities (COPD, history of pulmonary embolism about two years ago with ongoing treatment for clots, and a kidney transplant in 1991 that is, oddly, stable).   We're seeking a second opinion and have a meeting with Dana Farber in a few weeks.

I'm currently driving her about an hour, each way, 5 days per week for whole-head radiation.  She has extreme anxiety and is taking a strict regimen of Ativan and THC in order to be able to handle the radiation.  She's also on a low-dose, 21-day regimen of Temozolomide and we're tapering her steroids--which is going well.  She is awake from about 7am--1 or 2pm and then mostly asleep the rest of the time, except when we get her up to eat or take meds.  Her PCP ordered PT and OT and that is totally not realistic considering her current ability to be awake.

My question:  We don't know what to expect.  She'll be done with radiation and chemo soon and then what?  If the treatment is effective will we have some lucid time before she starts declining again?  What do we do to help her die without suffering (or to lessen suffering)?  The care coordination has not been great and although we have asked for palliative care the oncologist didn't think she needed it.

Another important bit of information is that my mother struggles with what she calls ""bummer conversations.""  She seems to understand that she doesn't have much time but has decided to be hopeful that she'll be a medical miracle (and acknowledges that this is not super realistic).  As such, it's been difficult to speak with her radiology or oncology doctor in a straightforward way.  Also, we've disclosed to the doctors how 'high' she is during appointments but that hasn't stopped them from assuming she understands what is happening and what concerns to disclose or ask about.

Finally, we've done what we can as far as helping her to get her affairs in order (POA, health care proxy, etc) and complete an advanced directive regarding medical interventions; we've established her beneficiaries and helped her navigate finances and we're working on understanding her wishes regarding her service and cremation.  Adding that because I don't need much by way of advice around the logistics of preparing for her passing (unless you want to share something you wish you knew).",LockStockandSquirrel,t3_hk6s2o,9,2020-07-02 22:17:47,5,hk6s2o

There were no symptoms before the diagnosis so it was a shock for all of us that it was cancer. He's 67 and was about to retire. 

No treatment (surgery, chemo or radiotherapy) was offered because he was too sick and doctors said there's no use for treatment because it could only make his condition worse. He's spent almost the entire summer in different hospital wards (neurology, infection and intensive care) and suffered from a meningitis after the brain biopsy. He lost his ability to walk and talk after the meningitis so he only communicated with us by the movement of his eyes and eyebrows.

The brain hospice website (http://www.brainhospice.info/SymptomTimeline.html) is somehow helpful, but not enough.

He has a left frontal lobe tumour and is in the palliative phase. (He has no educated caretaker, though, just his wife). The tumour is progressing along the cortex.
He either lies in bed or sits on a chair made for people that cannot get up on their own. He is usually slumped to one side when sitting up. He can't lift his arms. He is not mobile on his own. He can't get up on his own. He is walked to the toilet twice a day and other than that, he wears diapers. His answers are largely incoherent, but not always. You can see that he is aware of his cognitive deficits, it's sad. He has been wanting to write a short letter for a week but hasn't been able to write a coherent sentence. He sleeps in his chair most of the day. His appetite is enormous despite only taking a minimal dose of corticosteroids and no other medicine. He is not in pain. He has been like this for about three weeks. Before, he was able to ""run""/stumble to the toilet on his own, slept a lot and was much more coherent.

I asked his doctor, who visits him at home, how much time we have left and despite asking this very clearly, all I got was, ""Well, don't hope for a recovery, you'd need a miracle for him to get better."" (?!)

I KNOW that death can come in various ways that will not allow me to ""be there"", such as a seizure or a brain hemorrhage. I have read about the symptoms present in the pre-dying and dying phase, even those specific to brain tumors. I'd say I'm relatively well-informed. But if you can add anything, like your experience, signs I should look out for, specific symptoms of frontal lobe tumours that creep along the cortex, I'd be very grateful.

I wanted to give a quick thanks to folks here for your support and well wishes. And a little update.

Things have changed since my last post, my husband is a lot more alert and he's also home now. He was discharged Thursday 19th. The first thought was that he'd be discharged to a rehabilitation facility (in the same hospital) but they sent him home so he could start his treatments ASAP. For some reason insurance doesn't pay for treatments while he's inpatient. So he's home. He's been resting a lot and is pretty mobile with a walker, but he gets tired really easily. Both he and our toddler are napping now.

I'm extremely happy to have him home. This is the best place for him, much more restful than the hospital and quiet, so his sleep has been much better. It has been very emotional. I'll see our daughter playing with him and I get so happy, and I take pictures, then I want to start crying. It's a roller coaster. His mom stayed with us last night but today it's been pretty quiet, so she went home today and is going to come back to help cook us a Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday.

The social worker at the hospital said he tried 19 places around town to find us some in-home help for physical therapy, and didn't find any, but we have an interview next week with someone from palliative care so I am hoping they can help us out with PT. 

If he's up to it, we're going to go drive around to look at Christmas lights tonight. Our city just turned on the lights downtown yesterday.",promelid,t3_jyh9c6,8,2020-11-21 19:49:48,27,jyh9c6

I don't want to go into full details of the tests she received but she refused biopsy, and she also refuses all treatments. Doctor told us last week she has glioblastoma and has only a few weeks left to live. She doesn't know her prognostic and refuses to be made aware of it. 


After many discussions my mother has decided she would like to go into hospice care. She needs someone with her 24/7 and she refuses to have friends and extended family come over to csre for her. There is a nice home for palliative care in her town so I think she will be comfortable there.


My question is : what can we do to make her stay there as happy, comfortable, and easy as possible? Are there some things you wish you knew afterwards or that you did or saw that made an impact of your loved one? I am already bringing pictures of the kids, comfy pyjamas, her favorite hand cream. And of course I intend to visit often. Anything else I should think about? 


My mother is still lucid, she can talk but stays in bed almost all day. She gets up to eat, go to the bathroom and get herself washed.",ebijou,t3_n6ndu2,3,2021-05-07 01:43:23,6,n6ndu2

So I’ll write my/his story.

Dad was 67 when he got diagnosed with glioblastoma in mid November. He was relatively in his usual state of health. We noticed that his mood was getting indifferent for some time. Normally he would talk to us on the phone for a few minutes but we noticed that it would only be for a minute before handing it off to my mom. He seemed like he was being less social. We thought maybe it was because of COVID-19 ruining his social life of going to the library and hanging out with some friends. He knew something was off as well so he went to his doctor who told him that maybe he should see a therapist to help with how he’s feeling. That was to be scheduled for a week or so later.

Leading up to the therapist appointment my mom called and said that dad was sleeping more and that she noticed his walking was a little different but he insisted that he was fine. He was still driving the car to take my mom to work and stuff too, so all we could say was to keep an eye on it. Then one day he slept all freaking day. He woke up for an hour in the morning and went back to sleep and refused to wake up. We told her to keep trying and to take him to the hospital because this isn’t normal. My mom tried her hardest and she eventually called her brother and sister in law to try to help get him up. He finally gave in and changed his clothes to go but then became stubborn and said no again. They threatened to call an ambulance to say that he is a danger to himself in order to both scare him and get him to go worse come to worse. He eventually went to the ER. Apparently he was doing okay there. He was eating food and was asking when he could go home. The doctor spoke to us since my wife and I are hospital workers. The ER resident said that they are doing lab work but he seems okay. We explained the above story and we convinced the doctor to do a CT scan of his brain because this was an acute situation. They came back and said that he has a large brain tumor and that they want to transfer him to another hospital because they are better equipped to take care of it. My wife is a doctor and asked the doctor what they think it is to which they said that it looks like glioblastoma. My wife gave me a big hug and said she was sorry. I had no idea why she was giving me a hug and she explained it to me. It sucks.

My brother and I live on the East Coast. We flew out the next day to be with mom since dad was admitted and she was alone. Due to the size of the tumor on the MRI the doctor said surgery is an option but that he can only take about 30% of it out because of its position in the brain. Surgery was a success and he went with the normal treatment options of chemo and radiation therapy, and also Avastin. His biopsy results were IDH wild type, MGMT unmethylated. It went okay for the most part. He was pretty worn out near the last week of radiation therapy. We had to cancel an appointment or 2 because he was so weak and tired. We had palliative care be apart of the team immediately as my wife had recommended to us. We were hesitant because palliative/hospice always has such a negative meaning. It was one of the best decisions we made. They were very good and helped us make sure that dad was comfortable with the correct medications, and explained the situation to us.

His original MRI showed that he had a 7cmx5cmx5cm mass. In went down post surgery a bit. A few weeks later we did another MRI before the radiation therapy. It showed that the tumor had grown back to almost the same size it was before surgery. Obviously not good, but we decided to go ahead with everything to give him a shot. Dad’s tumor is on the left side of his brain, which subsequently unfortunately made his right leg and arm very weak and almost paralyzed. The Avastin amazingly allowed him to use that part of his body almost perfectly. He was walking around and generally was doing better for a bit. The second treatment didn’t work as well. Our neuro oncologist spoke with us after his final radiation therapy session and basically told us that the next dose of Avastin was not going to work for him because the 2nd dose did not work as effectively as the 1st dose. He said that further Chemo is not going to improve his outcome or quality of life. And so we stopped it. A week or so later we put him on hospice as he started sleeping quite heavily one day. I selfishly wanted a final MRI done to see if putting my dad through all the chemo, radiation, and Avastin was even worth it. But I couldn’t subject my dad to this when he was as weak as he was. The results were not going to change anything anyway. So from February until now he has been hospice.

He was doing fairly well for the most part. Eventually we had to move him to the hospice bed once he started getting weaker. We started using the commode more as well cause he couldn’t walk that well anymore. Finally we had to use diapers on him cause he wasn’t able to control it anymore. Then last week the bad times happened. He started vomiting a lot one day from early morning to the afternoon. We gave him an antivomiting suppository after having the hospice nurse come visit. We also had to give him a diazepam suppository because he was having seizures. The nurse told us that they would be coming to visit us daily now instead of 1-2 times a week. They said that he will be transitioning to death soon.

He threw up again yesterday night just the one time luckily. The nurse was telling us that he may die in the next few days or possibly week. He hasn’t been eating or drinking much. He is “emptying out his body” now as well via urine, bowel movements, and vomiting too. We knew it was coming since November. My brother and I have come to terms with it for the most part. Mom still needs time. Either way it’s gonna suck losing him.

TL;DR — Glioblastoma multiforme sucks so damn much. We're in the endgame now.

My mother in law was diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma in early June, it had spread all over her brain. To be honest she probably could have been diagnosed at least a month earlier. It took a while to get the MRI because we thought she was having dementia symptoms from not managing her diabetes (turns out it was the cancer that was clouding her judgement and causing her not to take the meds).The neuro said it’s inoperable and that that treatment would at most give her a little more quality time. We got a second opinion and it was even more grim. She decided not to do chemo and had made peace with a terminal diagnosis. She did do two weeks of palliative radiation and it gave her a couple good weeks so that her family could get in some quality time. 

Now things are going downhill. She’s completely out of it, is not recognizing her kids as much, some days she can only give yes or no answers. Weakness, she mostly gets around in a wheelchair that someone is pushing. Shes started getting mild headaches. Her nurses say mood that her mood has bee surprisingly good compared to other patients in her situation but we’ve started to notice some irritability. She’s  incontinent, sleeps a lot more, still eating pretty well. 

I know no one can really tell me, but I don’t know if we have weeks or months yet. One doctor initially said 4-6 weeks, another said 6 weeks - 6 months, I know there’s no way to know. Has anyone been in this same situation? What was the prognosis at this stage? I’ve seen that chart from the hospital that goes week by week but it seems like she’s been toward the bottom for a while. It feels like we’re waiting for the inevitable but don’t have even a guess when it’s going to happen. Thanks.

Last year my dad presented with stroke like symptoms, and with weird symptoms continuing months after the 'stroke', they finally did an MRI and found his tumor. He wanted to fight. Surgical removal, aggressive radiation,and his 3 month post treatment MRI in June showed no changes; but after declining the last few weeks I admitted him to hospital and they did another MRI showing reoccurrence in multiple spots. His neurosurgeon won't touch it again and his GP recommended comfort care (understood by me as palliative).  
He is barely able to communicate, with difficulty, usually not making sense or finding the right words; has lost much of his mobility in opposite site leg and can only ambulate with a walker; he is catheterized; and they said he cannot live alone but are releasing him from hospital care so it is all on me.
I live and work 5 hours away, in another province. Bringing him here isn't a great option as my house recently flooded and is being torn apart, there is no room... and with covid mandates being in his location means I am not allowed to even get groceries because I don't reside there. Plus the financial strain of not working. I already took the max govt caregiver credit when he was undergoing treatments...
And that doesn't even touch on the emotional aspect, everyone thinks I'm sooooo strong because I watched all my family die way before their 'time'. But I'm just a good actor. I know he cared for my mom at home until she passed and I know what it was like... And I have no idea how I can handle it... It seems beyond me. But he wants to be at home. I'm not even sure he understands that he is nearing the last few (weeks? Months?) of his life as he was asking the doctor when he can go back to work...
I'm so overwhelmed and sad and frustrated and angry and... Ugh. I just can't believe how he was doing so well in June and then BOOM worse than he ever was.

I've been struggling so much trying to get psych care, I got diagnosed with GBM in 2019, yes it's the ""good"" kind and I'm not dead yet but it feels like my own body is trying to kill me because it is and I feel trapped and really broken by all the treatment and just Tired. a nurse (who I'm friendly with, she isn't in oncology but I see her for something else) asked if I would do optune or similar when I have recurrence and I was just like. I am so goddamn miserable as it is I cannot imagine even doing the treatment I did before again, let alone that. I'm not really worried about recurrence as a general thing but if I had one tomorrow I think I might be brave enough to be like fuck no you're not dragging me through this again.

It's been ridiculously hard to find a doctor, I had one at the cancer center who barely did anything for me anyway tbh but at least we tried some new meds. then he randomly sent a letter saying he left anyway.. and then the new one isn't covered under my insurance, naturally.. I understand my cancer center not being able to help in a different state but a ""palliative expert"" neuro oncologist being like ""haha well good luck with that"" about finding psych help makes me cry to think about like. it's really a joke to everyone. maybe because I've been sad for so long they just don't think it's a major issue? but like. I just feel worse and worse and no one gives a fuck unless they can operate on me

everyone says to ask for help even me, I tell people that and then I can't even get myself a single psychiatrist appointment after six months. I was so proud of myself for finally telling my cancer center how bad I felt and I felt totally dismissed, today I was so relieved we finally seemed to get through to the right place and it turned out the doctor referred me for some speech therapy type exam not counseling/psychiatry.. and they're like again it's a really long wait... at what point do I not have to wait like I literally do not want to be alive and have access to medicine fairly regularly. and I HAVE been waiting for six months.

im sick of the distress forms and the pain scales and making it clear that i dont like being alive and i wish i wasnt and then when you ask for help theyre like well its apparently such a long wait that we cant even give you a date. i wonder who actually gets in or maybe terminal just puts me at the back of the line bc they figure ill die anyway. i literally WANT to live my life and do better and go to school or something but i cant do that when im so depressed and anxious and tired and unfocused. im just trying not to kms in the meantime while someone decides its my turn

im just so tired sorry, I wish people just sympathized instead of telling me that it's my fault and that I have to suck it up because everyone else is dealing with the same thing... i think no not everyone is dealing with the same thing, i feel so isolated and like alienated and even if im not the only one which i know im not it doesnt mean it doesnt suck to be like begging for help and everyone is just living their life, it feels so awkward even saying i have cancer like as if ive done something wrong.

idk if im supposed to call the place now and rant that i need help Now or if they wont even listen to that. if I call about my shoulder replacement I can have an appointment in 3 days, but you hate your life and can't even get an appointment in like a year apparently? i dont know what the hell to do to make doctors listen that i CANT wait anymore.

My (soon to be) father in law has been diagnosed with a grade 4 Glioblastoma. It’s been extremely aggressive with multiple tumors. His first focal seizure started about 4 months ago where it was mistaken as a stroke and was sent home with nothing more than anti-anxiety meds. 

After I came to visit last month, I noticed what was really going on after witnessing his seizure. I insisted we kept going to different hospitals until he received proper care. After 5 different hospitals, he was finally diagnosed. 

Unfortunately since then, he’s still been suffering horrible seizures. Now, he can’t speak and it’s difficult for him to swallow. 

I think the seizures are the worst part of his symptoms, we’re always on edge. No one is eating or sleeping well. We set alarms to make sure he gets his medications, but sometimes he still has them. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Or any advice on how I can give better support? Or what to expect? He’s starting radiation therapy soon. 

(It’s almost impossible for me to speak with doctors about it here. They’re not available via phone and I don’t know the language fluently yet).

I can see my fiancé under so much stress and really hurting. And I want be able to offer more guidance or reassurance to help alleviate some of that. 


Thank you all.

UPDATE: 

 (New to posting on Reddit so not sure if this is the correct way to post an update. I apologize in advance if it’s not) 

Thank you everyone for your help. We have his seizures under control now 🙏🏽 

Im working to get some sort of palliative care organized for him, But seems like it’s all DIY here in Brazil unfortunately. 

No one in the family knows about the reality of his GBM diagnosis (I’ve noticed the doctors here don’t speak about it as directly as doctors in the US).    

Which is why being able to share and ask questions in this community has been such a big help to me.

I just moved to the Indianapolis Area from Colorado. I’m a brain cancer patient, stage 2 diffuse astrocystoma. 
I’m about 1 1/2 years out from my craniotomy and tumor resection. 
They were able to remove damn near 99% of the visible tumor which was 4cm  in front left temporal lobe. 
Post brain surgery I’ve been one of the unlucky ones that has had continuous non-stop head/ skull pain. 

They put 3 titanium plates, and 10 titanium screw into my skull. After countless tests, CT scans, and MRI’s they still aren’t completely sure why I’m still having such intense constant pain. 

I’ve tried so many non narcotic treatments and therapies and nothing works besides opioids. 

My current doctor from Colorado labeled it as “intractable cancer related head pain”. 

My recent scan didn’t show any new tumor growths which is amazing! 

Unfortunately they still expect it to regrow again since the original tumor was technically labeled as malignant  it’s just a matter of time they said. 

My doctor from Colorado said she can’t give me any more meds of any kind after March 30th. We’ve been doing telehealth appts since I moved away. 

I’m currently on 6 15mg IR oxycodone’s per day. 

My regimen before that was 2 20mg ER opana’s and 4 4mg dilaudids per day. I want to get back to that regimen or at least some with an extended release med in it. 

Does anyone in the Indianapolis area have any recommendations for pain doctors or pain clinics in the Indianapolis area? Doesn’t have to be right in indy. I’m willing to drive. 

I’ve also thought about trying to get into palliative care, not hospice, but palliative. 

Any thoughts anyone?

My mother was diagnosed with GBM Grade IV, wild type with specific indicators that said it would be especially aggressive and untreatable back in January. At that time her main tumor was quite large, over 7 cm in length  - and what the Dr told me was that it would have grown that large inside of 5 months. There was also severe indication of microscopic spread and satellite regions. She had maximum surgical resection at the end of January. She wasn't great (significant aphasia, trouble reading and writing, trouble with coordination etc), but she was functioning. 

She had radiation and chemo February to April. It was moved up from end of February to mid February as she lost feeling in her entire right side (one of many ER visits at this point). Radiation did show reduction in size of the main tumor, but with a couple of satellite regions to 'keep an eye on'

She then went through the next 'standard of care' which is increased chemo for 5 days, with 21 days off. By the end of her first round, the family friend I had with her could no longer take care of her and she became wheelchair bound due to lack of strength. She experienced at least some focal seizures where she essentially lost total control of her body for a couple of minutes. I scrambled and after about 2 weeks found someone who could stay with her and help to take care of her (quick ref: she has no family in her area, my siblings and I are all at least 3.5 hrs away if not more, and everyone else family wise that could stay with her outside of her husband, who needs to work to have her health insurance, is farther than that).

She has went through one more round of chemo and when attempting to do the 3rd round of the 6 month SOC, was told her platelets were too low and now she can't do chemo until her platelets have recovered.

Last weekend she started to have blurry vision and was told to go to the ER for an MRI.. again. According to the MRI, it's essentially spread EVERY F***ING where in her brain - there are spots in at least 6 new locations including her optic chiasm. She will definitely lose her sight. She will lose optic movement. It's already in areas that could essentially stop her body from completing autonomic automatic functions like breathing, pumping her heart, etc. 

I've reached out to several clinical trials and it's as though there is all the time in the world. No one acts as though they are running against a clock and it is hellishly frustrating.

I need to keep fighting for her. Don't tell me to accept defeat. I won't. 

If that's your response - to give up - don't bother answering this post - I already know and understand your position. I can understand that palliative care is likely what will occur, that doesnt mean I need to give up on finding other advice/resources.

What am I not thinking of? Are there any clinical trials that will actually get back to you? What has worked for anyone else with GBM of this magnitude. Where can I go? What can I do?",OrganizationCrafty66,t3_we0uz3,11,2022-08-02 03:21:15,11,we0uz3

He completed his second course of TMZ (first course of the higher dose w/o radiation) on the week of 7/11. On the second day of this treatment he became incontinent, and on the third day we had to take him to the hospital because of increased confusion that seemed to be from weaning his steroids too quickly. He was able to finish the TMZ and the steroids were adjusted, and he was discharged from the hospital a couple days later. Though his incontinence continued, he continued to have good days among bad days where he seemed more present and was even able to take walks outside with us.

He became increasingly tired over time and began to take more naps. On Wednesday (7/27) his eating and drinking started to decrease significantly. He would eat maybe most of his breakfast but refuse to eat more than a couple bites of dinner/snacks throughout the day. We believed that to be because he had thrush in his mouth. This past Monday (8/1) in the morning we discovered that he was on the floor after a fall -- we suppose he must have tried to get up and failed, despite him not really getting up at all for days. We were unable to get him up so we called 911 and had him taken to the hospital and admitted.

The first few days of his hospital stay were about the same as he was at home -- asleep for most of the day but would greet us as we entered the room, would respond to questions, would take a couple bites of meals before refusing the rest. The hospital found that he had a UTI and treated it with antibiotics. We were hoping that the infection was the cause of his decline, but on Friday (8/5) he became much more unresponsive. That morning, his care team apparently had to call in rapid response because it took so much effort to wake him. He now is asleep pretty much all of the time, eating and drinking nothing, and just receiving fluids through an IV. He will sometimes open his eyes briefly if someone greets him, otherwise he is asleep. The doctors said his infection has been optimally treated, and he had an MRI done today which showed the tumor is the same size. There is some new enhancement on the MRI but it has not grown. 

I frequent this subreddit and the GBM community on Facebook, so I'm all too familiar with how quickly the decline comes and the symptoms that come along with it. I've been checking his symptoms with the brain hospice timeline and though the timing is not exactly the same, the progression seems to line up. We will be talking with palliative care and hospice tomorrow and going from there. 

I'm just absolutely floored with sadness. Dad was never the same after his craniotomy -- he developed significant aphasia and cognitive impairment following it, so we never even really were able to have a conversation or understand one another. Because of this, I had been mourning the loss of who my dad was even with him physically present. Yet despite already mourning that loss, the fact that he may be actually leaving us soon is so hard to bear. I'm only 24, and I can't believe that I'm about to not have a dad soon. I would do *anything* to be able to spend even just an hour with pre-GBM him so I would be able to hug him tighter and have one more conversation like we used to. I'm so scared for what comes next.",nyaatalie,t3_wiybdt,12,2022-08-08 03:28:57,28,wiybdt
/r/braincancer/comments/wo8snr/dad_is_gone/,https://www.reddit.com/r/braincancer/comments/wo8snr/dad_is_gone/,braincancer,t5_2x8y5,Dad is gone,"I posted 6 days ago about how we seemed to be nearing the end of my dad's short journey with GBM. Palliative care estimated that he had ~24 hours left this past Monday. 

It certainly seemed that way at that point, especially on Tuesday -- he had become completely unresponsive, the ""death rattle"" was going strong, and his limbs became cold. But then he continued to fight for days longer. His death rattle subsided, he had moments of responsiveness. It got to the point where none of us could guess how much longer he would fight for with his symptoms coming and going, progressing and then regressing through the final few stages of the brain hospice timeline. 

He passed away early this morning around 4:40 am. He had been at the hospital still and we woke up to a call from the nurse that he had maybe 10-15 minutes left. My mom, sister and I rushed up to the hospital but the moment we walked through the doors, we got the call. We were too late. I feel so guilty and devastated that we weren't by his side when he passed. 

I had taken everyone's advice -- this past week while we knew what was coming, I held his hand. I recalled my favorite memories, I thanked him for everything he's done, I told him that I loved him and everything else that I needed him to know. I'm glad that I did that. 

Life doesn't feel real right now. To live in a world where he no longer exists feels so painful. I'm relieved that he's no longer suffering anymore, but it's only a small relief. 

Dad's timeline for anyone who is curious:

- Mid-March 2022: Developed expressive aphasia that started minor but quickly worsened. Doctor thought it might have been a stroke, CT scan showed mass. Referred to Rush in Chicago for neurosurgeon consult. 
- March 30, 2022: Underwent craniotomy. Surgeon was able to get most of the mass but some was too deep as it resided near his left basal ganglia. After surgery, his aphasia worsened and he also lost 100% function of his right arm and had significant right leg weakness.
- April 25, 2022: Discharged from inpatient rehab to home. 
- Mid-May 2022: Started radiation + chemo. He did 3 weeks of radiation as opposed to 6 due to quality of life concerns. 
- June 1, 2022: Completed radiation + chemo.
- July 8, 2022: MRI showed tumor shrinkage. Started Optune.
- July 11, 2022: Began first course of the higher dose TMZ for 5 days. During this he had to be hospitalized due to increasing confusion but it was attributed to weaning his steroids too quickly. Steroid dosage was returned to normal and he was able to complete the course and also showed some improvement. Incontinence also started after this week.
- July 27, 2022: Stopped eating a ton, we believed it to be due to thrush in his mouth. Started to sleep a lot more.
- August 1, 2022: Admitted to the hospital as he hadn't eaten for days and was almost completely bedridden then had a fall. He was not injured from this fall. Hospital found a UTI that had become severe as traces were found in his bloodstream. MRI showed that the tumor had not grown.
- August 5, 2022: Stopped eating completely and became mostly unresponsive. He was now asleep pretty much 24/7. 
- August 14, 2022: Passed away.",nyaatalie,t3_wo8snr,11,2022-08-14 15:18:44,20,wo8snr

I can think of a few categories and sub-categories people can contribute to based on their experiences.

I also know not all approaches we take may be fully scientifically verified or even endorsed by standard of care and may vary across geographies and should be rigorously labelled as such. Also aware that YMMV.

My initial thoughts on the taxonomy of such a post would be:

Potentially separated to:

A. For the patient
B. For the caregiver

Chronologically:
A. Diagnosis (I have a brain tumor, what do I do next?)
A1. Taking the information in / emotional preparedness
A2. How to interpret medical information given to you e.g location of tumour and grades of tumours.
A3. What questions to ask and how to evaluate the care you are getting

B. Next steps
B1. Defining your priorities e.g. quality of life
B2. Common resources about brain tumors 
B3. Standard of care as defined by WHO
B4. Aid/welfare available to you in different geographies

C. Navigating treatment
C1. Surgery or no surgery?
C2. What to expect before, during and after surgery
C3. How to understand histology results
C4. What to expect and prepare for during, before after radiation
C5. Chemo or no chemo? And understanding different types

D. Palliative and End of Life Support
D1. Mental health resources for caregivers
D2. Palliative/comforting/symptoms relieving supplements, activities etc.
D3. Ideas on filling up the days of your loved ones with the best memories possible and keeping their legacy alive going forward
D4. Hospice and end of life options.

These are just my personal thoughts, as it feels to me that for each of these categories I had to do long periode of hunting and assessing information online. Sincerely welcome your thoughts and the opinions of more experienced folks too.
